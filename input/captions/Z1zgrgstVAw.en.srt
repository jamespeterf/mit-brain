1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,039
Hello class. Uh welcome to 18200. So if

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,600
you're in the right place, uh this is

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,439
principles of discrete applied math. Uh

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
I'll be one of your co- lectures. I'm

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,000
Ankor Mitra and the other co-lecture is

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
Peter Shore. So Peter, you want to stand

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
up and take a bow? [laughter]

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
So the basic topics that we're going to

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,160
be covering is we're going to top cover

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,160
topics like probability counting. This

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,520
will be the beginning part of the class.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,920
Some of you have may have seen these

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
topics before, but really in the later

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,680
parts of the class, we're going to cover

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
some quite new things. We'll talk a lot

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,719
about generating functions, number

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,600
theory, uh cryptography, coding theory,

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
things like noless coding, uh linear

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,920
programming, and lots of other fun

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,760
topics. You know, I want to mention that

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,680
um I mean the goal for this class is to

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,239
try and teach you how to express proofs

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,360
in an understandable way. This is one of

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,439
these skills at MIT that uh you know you

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,680
can kind of pick up a little bit from

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
various classes along the way. But

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
sitting down and conscientiously

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,520
thinking about you know what makes a

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,520
proof easy to follow. you know, how to

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,280
make it more modular and understandable

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,680
for the audience is something that's

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,320
going to help you a lot with other uh

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
parts of math and also other parts of

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,000
computer science in general. A lot of

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,720
the things that go into good coding

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,720
practices in terms of modularity are the

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
same types of things we think about when

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,640
we're writing good proofs.

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,720
So, uh that's enough boilerplate uh for

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,119
me. Uh I can only go so long without

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,680
talking about math. So what we're going

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,840
to be talking about today is um we're

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,920
going to talk about uh the pigeon hole

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
principle. Actually first let me hand it

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,360
off to Susan who's going to tell you a

46
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,320
little bit more about the recitations

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,040
and then I'll take it away after that.

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,920
>> Thank you very much Anker. So as Anker

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,680
noted this is a CIM a communication

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,680
intensive class in the major and the

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,920
purpose of CAM is to help you to

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,200
communicate effectively as

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,879
mathematicians. That's for CIM. CIM's in

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,959
the math department. So, communicating

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,200
successfully in a new discipline

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,360
requires expertise in several different

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,400
domains. This is based on a model by

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,800
Anne Bowfort and we will give you we

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
will teach you in these different

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,879
domains over the course of this semester

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,519
in the recitations. So you need

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,920
expertise of course with the content and

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,160
so the recitations will be designed to

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,959
help you reinforce your understanding of

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,760
the mathematics in addition to other

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,440
aspects of communication. To communicate

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,319
successfully as a mathematician, you

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,800
need to know the norms of mathematics

69
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,120
because they vary. There are differences

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
between norms in core six and course and

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
norms in mathematics and you'll become

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
familiar with some of those. For

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
example,

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,879
what goes into the introduction of a

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,519
paper for the term paper. That'll be

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,760
basically a multi-page proof and we'll

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,319
tell you the differences what goes in

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,200
the introduction there. Um, also norms

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,080
of wording like how to use the word we.

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,720
Mathematicians use we in different ways

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
than some other disciplines.

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
You also to communicate successfully as

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,440
a mathematician. You also need expertise

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,360
with processes for generating effective

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,200
communication. That includes drafting.

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,159
We'll have multiple drafts built into

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
the term paper as well as things like

88
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,840
how to use latte and you'll start

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,480
learning that right off with the first

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,239
pet. If you're unfamiliar with latte,

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,400
please reach out. We can help you in

92
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,120
office hours.

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,080
You also need expertise

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,400
with rhetoric. And by this I mean um

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,720
rhetorical strategies, strategies for

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
accomplishing your goals as a

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,640
communicator.

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,040
For example, if mathematicians if they

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,159
have a complicated proof, one way to

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,040
communicate the logic clearly is to use

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,319
modularity, break the proof apart, pull

102
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,519
out a lema. Other strategies that you'll

103
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:22,560
learn in recitation are um how to

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,639
structure the um the ordering of

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,520
information within sentences within

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,080
sections within the paper to make the

107
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,040
paper flow well to reveal the flow of

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,600
the underlying logic so that readers can

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,919
easily follow the logic and also how to

110
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
use what we call guiding text to guide

111
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,639
readers through the logic. and we'll

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,639
give other strategies in recitation

113
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,639
also.

114
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,800
>> All right. Uh so back to me. So I'm

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,560
going to tell you the uh about one of

116
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
the first topics we're going to cover uh

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,800
in class which is um you know very

118
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,720
simple but powerful idea. We're going to

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,268
be discussing something called the

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
pigeon hole principle.

121
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:06,320
[clears throat] Now the pigeon hole

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,720
principle uh let me tell you the main

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,199
takeaways before we get into it. It's a

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
very simple idea. I'll tell you what

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,880
exactly it is and then we'll go through

126
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,199
some neat applications of it. Uh it

127
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,600
turns out to be shockingly powerful even

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,080
though you'll think of it as a very

129
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
obvious statement. I guess the other

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
thing which you know uh is important to

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,440
keep in mind it's also quite oddly

132
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,280
named.

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,479
I don't really know the entomology of

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,840
why it's called the pigeon hole

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,759
principle but um you know the basic idea

136
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
let's explain it through an example and

137
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,160
then I'll tell you about where the

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,880
pigeons come in. So uh here's a problem

139
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,479
that many of us face every day. So,

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,039
imagine that we have five colors of

141
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,440
socks

142
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,440
in your drawer

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,520
and it's, you know, early in the

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,360
morning, so you're trying to find a

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,720
match that you can get dressed and go to

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,919
work. And um you know, one of the basic

147
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,160
problems you could ask is how many socks

148
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,120
do you have to pick out from your drawer

149
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,520
to guarantee that even if you're very

150
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
very unlucky, no matter what, you must

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
have a match.

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,880
So this is really an example of the

153
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,400
pigeonal principle in action. Uh we'll

154
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,960
see why exactly it's the pigeonal

155
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,039
principle in a minute, but um any ideas?

156
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,319
So how many pairs how many socks do I

157
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,440
have to pull out so that I'm guaranteed

158
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,560
a pair?

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,039
>> Yeah.

160
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,560
six. Perfect. Because you know, you

161
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,880
could get very unlucky in the beginning

162
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,479
and your first five could be each

163
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
different colors and then no matter what

164
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,160
the sixth one is, it's going to match

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,919
with one of the ones you've selected so

166
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,600
far. This is, you know, really uh an

167
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,919
example of a much more general

168
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,400
principle. So, let me explain it with

169
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,880
pigeons and then we'll talk about some

170
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,880
more fun applications. So more

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
generally,

172
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,080
we can imagine that we've got n pigeons.

173
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,319
I'll even draw them for you.

174
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,680
And we're placing them

175
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,680
in m pigeon holes.

176
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,520
I don't know why they want to go in the

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,680
pigeon holes, but they do.

178
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,560
And let's imagine that n, our number of

179
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:35,479
pigeons, is strictly larger than m. Then

180
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,479
what I claim is that there must

181
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,440
be

182
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,639
at least two pigeons

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,599
in the same pigeon hole.

184
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,599
That's the pigeon hole principle.

185
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,639
Now, we're going to talk a lot about,

186
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,039
you know, how to write good proofs. And

187
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,479
honestly, a lot of us professors spend a

188
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,160
lot of time thinking about, you know,

189
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,800
how to teach in class and make it

190
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,199
engaging. I remember back when I used to

191
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
teach 042, you know, when I covered

192
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
things like the pigeonal principle,

193
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
there was a bit of an arms race between

194
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,639
faculty to come up with, you know, the

195
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,879
best props for, you know, how to explain

196
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,639
simple things. And I borrowed from one

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,919
of my colleagues, you know, a whole box

198
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,599
of fake dead pigeons, which was very

199
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,440
strange, right? because I was going down

200
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,479
the elevators in the status center with

201
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,319
my box of dead pigeons and I got a lot

202
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,479
of strange looks. You know, people would

203
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
ask me what's going on. And then I had

204
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,360
to explain to them that I'm teaching the

205
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,279
pigeon hole principle. I don't know why

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
it's called the pigeon hole principle.

207
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,159
But then someone asked me when I was on

208
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,680
the elevator, does that really help

209
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
people understand the pigeon hole

210
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,360
principle? And I got to say, I don't

211
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,959
think it does. You know, once you get

212
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
that question, you have to re-evaluate

213
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,600
your teaching preferences and

214
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
priorities. But in any case, this is the

215
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
pigeon hole principle. I don't know why

216
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,680
the pigeons want to go into the pigeon

217
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,399
holes, but you know, you can see how the

218
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,560
simple example of socks and finding a a

219
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,399
pair is an example of the pigeon hole

220
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,160
principle. You just have to be careful

221
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,680
about what are the pigeons and what are

222
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,320
the holes. In this case, it's pretty

223
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,320
obvious that, you know, the um the

224
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,560
pigeons are individual socks and the

225
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,640
holes are, you know, colors of different

226
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
socks. But there are other applications

227
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,839
that we're going to see where it's a

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,920
little bit more subtle how exactly to

229
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,839
get this principle to work. Let me tell

230
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,240
you one generalization which is also

231
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,240
powerful which is in general you know

232
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,560
imagine I had way more pigeons than

233
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,399
pigeon holes. It turns out you can

234
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,000
guarantee that there's at least the

235
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,800
ceiling of n over m pigeons in the same

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,279
pigeon hole. So this is a very simple

237
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,080
idea. Let's actually try and prove it

238
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,839
even though it might seem obvious. So it

239
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,480
turns out there's a very simple way to

240
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,320
prove it. Um you know this is one

241
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,800
example of a proof technique we're going

242
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,480
to see you know all throughout class

243
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,480
which is a proof by contradiction.

244
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,440
And you know I'm going to try and

245
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,279
practice what I preach in today's

246
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,000
lecture and show you what are the right

247
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,760
ways to write up proofs. Uh you know

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
this won't be quite as formal as you do

249
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,680
for your writing exercise but pretty

250
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
close. You know, you can see that the

251
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,440
first thing I'm doing when I write a

252
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,040
proof by contradiction is I'm putting,

253
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,279
you know, very clearly the fact that

254
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
it's a proof by contradiction. You don't

255
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,880
want your readers to be confused until

256
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,040
the very end where the pieces come

257
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,880
together. You want as much as possible

258
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,200
that they see the blueprint of how the

259
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,760
proof is supposed to go before they get

260
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
through all of it. Right? And so what

261
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,640
we're going to do is we're going to

262
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,320
suppose not we'll suppose that the

263
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,360
pigeon hole principle is false. Right?

264
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,360
Then what I can do is I can really just

265
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
count the number of pigeons and the

266
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,839
number of holes in two different ways,

267
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,800
right? So what I can do is, you know, n

268
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,800
is my number of pigeons. Now each pigeon

269
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,440
has to be assigned to some hole. So I

270
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,720
can sum over all of the different holes

271
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,880
h that I'm interested in. And I can look

272
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,079
at NH where NH here is just defined to

273
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,519
be the number of pigeons

274
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,200
that are in some particular hole h.

275
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,240
Right? So it's just a count of how many

276
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,839
pigeons ended up in that hole. And all

277
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm doing is I'm just counting the

278
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,480
different pigeons in a different way. So

279
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,079
that's definitely equal to n. But now by

280
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,720
assumption, you know, since the pigeon

281
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,800
hole principle is false, I'm assuming

282
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:28,720
that each one of the holes

283
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,959
has at most one pigeon in it. Right? And

284
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,079
then the total number of holes I get is

285
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,560
m. So now what I claim is I have a

286
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,079
contradiction. Why? Because I've just

287
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,120
shown for you that if the pigeonal

288
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,920
principle is false, then n is less than

289
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,240
or equal to m. But what was my starting

290
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,040
assumption was just that n is strictly

291
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,600
larger than m. Right? So this is my

292
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,079
proof. But

293
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,000
m is larger than n. That's one of the

294
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,000
assumptions. And so we get a

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
contradiction.

296
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
That's it. That's our first proof in

297
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
this class. This is an example of how

298
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
you might write up a proof by

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,279
contradiction. A lot of times in class,

300
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,200
they'll be a lot more complicated than

301
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,639
this, but they all follow this basic

302
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,880
blueprint. Yes.

303
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,880
>> Ah, sorry. N is greater than m. Thank

304
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,639
you. n is greater than m.

305
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,800
Any other questions or that was it?

306
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,279
Okay, good. Feel free to interject any

307
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,360
time with questions. All right, let me

308
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,880
show you one other principle in action.

309
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,160
So, let's talk about some cooler

310
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,320
applications of the pigeon hole

311
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
principle. Now that we know what it is

312
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,519
and we know why it's true and we've seen

313
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,519
some simple illustrations of it,

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,800
um you know what I claim is that a lot

315
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,279
of times uh writing a good proof is also

316
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,800
about finding the right abstraction for

317
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,200
how to think about something, how to

318
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,959
model it, right? So let me give you a

319
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,120
simple lema that we're going to prove.

320
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,800
So first this lema isn't going to sound

321
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
like the pigeon hole principle, but

322
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,279
we'll turn it into the pigeon hole

323
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
principle. Let's imagine you're going to

324
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,920
a party. Let's say you're going to the

325
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,519
Super Bowl party this weekend. And

326
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,279
you've got n people.

327
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,480
There are n total people including

328
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,680
yourself at the party. What I claim is

329
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,959
that no matter, you know, who's there,

330
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,120
there are always two people, at least

331
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,160
two people

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,160
who know

333
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,160
the same number

334
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,320
of other people.

335
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,560
This is a mathematical fact about

336
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,720
parties, right? This doesn't quite look

337
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,760
like the pigeonal principle, but I claim

338
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,839
it is. And moreover, what we really need

339
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,480
is we need the right way to think about

340
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,519
this, right? And we'll practice this

341
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,040
type of skill a lot in recitations. You

342
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,880
know, this is an example of something

343
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,440
which is a lot easier to prove when you

344
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,839
have the right way to visualize it. So

345
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,360
it turns out that the right way to you

346
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:13,839
know visualize it is to draw a graph

347
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
namely something with nodes that

348
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,399
represent people at the party. So there

349
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
are n different nodes in my graph and

350
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,160
then there are edges that represent

351
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,880
different relationships whether the two

352
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,279
people know each other or not. So for

353
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,760
example, you know, I could have that the

354
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,839
people in my party look like they define

355
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,199
this graph. I've got four people in my

356
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,320
party. N equals 4. Again, as I

357
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,279
mentioned, each of these nodes are

358
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,519
people. They're individual people. And

359
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,120
these edges

360
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,240
represent

361
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,240
people who know each other.

362
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,880
And then when I draw in all my edges,

363
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,360
you know, maybe I'll end up with a graph

364
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,440
like this, right? And you can see that

365
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,839
there are two people who know the same

366
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,519
number of people at the party like this

367
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,839
node right here and this node right

368
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,680
here. The number of edges that are

369
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,839
incident to that node which represents

370
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,560
how many other people they know is both

371
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,800
two. So my lema is true in this simple

372
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,519
example. And now I can understand

373
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,160
through this visual you know how exactly

374
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,279
a graph relates to this lema that I

375
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,600
asserted to begin with.

376
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,639
So now uh we can actually prove it once

377
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,680
we have this abstraction in hand. So

378
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,680
let's talk about how that works.

379
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,399
Let me define one more quantity which

380
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,480
will be of interest for us today just

381
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,560
called the degree. That's just the

382
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,880
number of n uh edges that are incident

383
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,880
to a node.

384
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,600
So the degree

385
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,600
of a node

386
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:02,600
is the number of edges

387
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,600
incident to it

388
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,279
that share an endpoint that have that

389
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,000
node as an endpoint. So now let's try

390
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,800
and prove this using the pigeonal

391
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,320
principle. In fact, the crucial thing in

392
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,079
applying the pigeon hole principle is to

393
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,120
figure out what are the pigeons and what

394
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,959
are the holes. Does anyone have any idea

395
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
what we should make the pigeons be and

396
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,519
what we should make the holes be to try

397
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,519
and prove this lema?

398
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,320
>> Yeah,

399
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
>> maybe.

400
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,759
>> Okay, that's uh we could try that way. I

401
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,240
might have a little bit of difficulty

402
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,240
that way. Yeah.

403
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,720
>> Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Because you know

404
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,480
where do I want the collision, right? So

405
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,880
the collision happens between two

406
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,440
pigeons who land in the same hole. So

407
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,519
what I want is I want two people to

408
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,839
collide. And what does it mean to

409
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,079
collide? I want them to have the same

410
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,360
degree. So that tells me what should be

411
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,240
the pigeons and what should be the

412
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,120
holes. So what I claim is that the

413
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,120
degree

414
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,079
of each note.

415
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:25,039
Well, first of all, it's an integer

416
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:29,200
that's in this set from zero one all the

417
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:32,799
way up to n minus one.

418
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,960
And uh you know each node is going to be

419
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,720
this

420
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,880
pigeon,

421
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,480
right? And the way that I'm going to

422
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,880
choose which particular hole it gets

423
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,640
mapped to is what the associated degree

424
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,840
is. So I have a hole. Each name is an

425
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,440
integer from 0 up to n minus one. And

426
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,200
then each particular node that

427
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,760
represents a person is going to get

428
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,880
mapped to whatever their degree is.

429
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,880
Right? So uh sounds like I'm done. Uh am

430
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,559
I done here? Can I just appeal to the

431
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,360
pigeon hole principle and say that two

432
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,360
nodes must collide?

433
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,480
>> Yeah,

434
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,640
>> set of possibility.

435
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,960
>> That's right. So, I'm definitely not

436
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
done right now. Right. Because the

437
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,840
pigeon hole principle only works when n

438
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,840
is strictly larger than m. That's when I

439
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,480
picked out six socks for my drawer and I

440
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,480
had five colors. I really needed one

441
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
more pigeon than the number of holes.

442
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
And the trouble is here, how many

443
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,000
pigeons do I have? Well, it's each node

444
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,320
in the graph. That's the number of the

445
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,240
people at the party. That's n. How many

446
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,120
holes do I have? Well, unfortunately,

447
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,960
that's also n because it's the integers

448
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:55,039
from 0 to n minus one. But now we need a

449
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,320
clever idea. So I wonder is it possible

450
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:03,480
to have a node of degree zero and a node

451
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,480
of degree n minus one at the same time.

452
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,120
So who can help me out? Yeah.

453
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,880
>> Well, that means you know everybody and

454
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,919
then

455
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
that's a cross prediction.

456
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,400
>> That's perfect. Exactly right. Let me

457
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,919
say it again because I have the mic. So

458
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,640
if there's someone at the party who

459
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,880
knows n minus one people, well there's

460
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,280
nodes and that means he's connected to

461
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,760
every other node and that means there

462
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,559
isn't anyone at the party who knows no

463
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,320
one. So actually these two end points

464
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:37,360
are mutually exclusive, right? They

465
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,120
can't both happen.

466
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,720
So if I wanted to write this out

467
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
formally as a proof, I would actually

468
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,919
have to do a case analysis here, right?

469
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,760
In order to create my contradiction, I

470
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,880
would say, you know, case number one,

471
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,720
there is a node of degree n minus one.

472
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,280
In which case, that means there's no

473
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,760
node of degree zero. And I'm back down

474
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,360
to having n minus one holes and n

475
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,679
pigeons. And then I can appeal to the

476
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,760
pigeon hole principle and call it a day.

477
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,960
And in case two, where there's no node

478
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,280
of degree n minus one, again, I only

479
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,520
have n minus one possibilities for the

480
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,520
holes. So, you know, I'm not going to be

481
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,919
able to write up the full-blown proofs

482
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,000
when we do them in lecture, but you can

483
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,320
see that to really make this a full

484
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,640
bulletproof proof, there are a lot of

485
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,000
steps that go into how exactly you can

486
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,200
lay out the proof, right? So, I'll just

487
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,480
stop here and say that, you know, can't

488
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,679
be both

489
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,280
degree n minus one and zero. And that

490
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,880
lets us appeal to the pigeon hole

491
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,320
principle.

492
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,919
So we're good. So this is another

493
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,080
example of the pigeon hole principle in

494
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,679
action even though it doesn't look like

495
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,679
it at first because you have to figure

496
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,840
out what's the right abstraction, namely

497
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,240
a graph for how to think about and

498
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,480
visualize what's actually happening

499
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,400
underneath this lema.

500
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,600
Let's do another example. We're going to

501
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,520
get harder and harder unfortunately.

502
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,120
Uh so let me give you another of my

503
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,320
favorite examples of the pigeon hole

504
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,559
principle in action.

505
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,840
which is a very easy to state problem

506
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,640
but turns out to be very difficult from

507
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,640
a complexity standpoint.

508
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,000
So let's imagine let me tell you the

509
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,240
statement of this lema and then we'll

510
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,360
get into how exactly to prove it.

511
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,200
Suppose I give you

512
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,960
20

513
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,440
fourdigit numbers,

514
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,440
positive numbers.

515
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,960
Let's just call them x1 up to x20.

516
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,840
Right? Then what I claim is that there

517
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,840
are

518
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,320
two disjoint

519
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,320
sets of them

520
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:09,000
and I'll say specifically non-MPT

521
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,000
sets with the same sum.

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,200
So what am I asking here? Right? So I

523
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,520
give you any 24-digit numbers. they have

524
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,080
to be strictly positive.

525
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,120
And what I'm going to do is um I'm going

526
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,880
to take some subset of them, maybe x1

527
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,559
plus x3 plus x5. And then I'll take some

528
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,000
other subset of them that doesn't

529
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,200
overlap in any of those integers, x2 and

530
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,200
x4 and x6. And what I claim is that

531
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,159
there's a way of doing this so that the

532
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,320
sum of the integers in one set is equal

533
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,760
to the sum of the integers in the other

534
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,600
set.

535
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,080
Now, moreover, this would be sort of a

536
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,600
trivial lema if I let these sets be

537
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,679
empty because I could just take the

538
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
empty set for one and the empty set for

539
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
the other. They're definitely disjoint.

540
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,240
They don't share anything in common. And

541
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,080
their sum is zero. So, this would be a

542
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,640
really boring way for this lema to be

543
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,640
true. What I'm saying by non-empt is I'm

544
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,960
ruling out that trivial case. There's

545
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,960
always an interesting way to do this

546
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
where you've really created a positive

547
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,200
sum for these integers two different

548
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,120
ways.

549
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,559
All right. So let's try and prove this

550
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,120
and then I'll tell you some interesting

551
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,799
facts about this uh this very simple

552
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,960
statement.

553
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,360
And again what we have to do to you know

554
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,880
write up a proof here is we have to do

555
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,520
the usual things where we have to figure

556
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,159
out what the pigeons are what the holes

557
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,480
are but moreover we have to figure out

558
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,880
the right you know mathematical notation

559
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,440
for expressing what's going on in this

560
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,919
problem. Right?

561
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,039
And so in fact a lot of times the first

562
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,760
step is really to figure out some

563
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,280
mathematical way to express the

564
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,320
statement right here that I've written

565
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,320
out in English. So another way to think

566
00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:00,720
about this is that I claim there are

567
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,600
sets I and J which are subsets of the

568
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,679
integers from one up to 20. What are

569
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,080
these subsets supposed to represent?

570
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,360
just which of the numbers I'm taking in

571
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:16,080
my sum. I want that, you know, these

572
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,520
sets are both non-mpt. So I and J had

573
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,600
better not be equal to the empty set. I

574
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,039
need that they're disjoint, which just

575
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,480
says that the intersection between I and

576
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,640
J is equal to the empty set. So this is

577
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,120
just the mathematical way of expressing

578
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,880
all of the things I have here. And now

579
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,640
for the most important piece of the

580
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:43,039
puzzle. I want that the sum over all of

581
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:46,720
the x subi in this first set is equal to

582
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,679
the sum of all of the x subjs in the

583
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,840
second set. Right? So a lot of times

584
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,840
it's hard to write a mathematical proof

585
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,480
unless you have the right mathematical

586
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,159
notation to begin with because even

587
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,000
though I could have expressed this in

588
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,679
English now to actually prove this

589
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
statement I'm going to have to do a

590
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,080
bunch of manipulations on these sets and

591
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,720
this will be a lot easier with this

592
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,840
notation in hand. So, you know, another

593
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,080
thing that we're going to teach you a

594
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,640
lot in recitation is how exactly to set

595
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:19,720
up convenient notation so that your

596
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,720
proofs will be easier to write, right?

597
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,159
All right. So now, how exactly are we

598
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,159
going to prove this?

599
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,440
Let's see if you guys have any

600
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,960
intuition. So, obviously, we're going to

601
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,960
be using the pigeonal principle because

602
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,760
I've only taught you one thing so far,

603
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,400
so we better use it. Um but what should

604
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,480
we use as

605
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,480
you know the pigeons?

606
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Yeah.

607
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,000
>> Ah [sighs]

608
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,919
okay you're right but for the holes I

609
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,279
think. So let's be care. Yeah. So I'll

610
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,960
take your answer for the holes because

611
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,520
the way to think about it is that we

612
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,600
want a collision among the pigeons. So

613
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,520
we really want a collision among what

614
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,159
objects? Was there a answer in the back?

615
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,720
Yeah.

616
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,039
Yeah. Uh, I like that. I'm going to

617
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,840
strike number of and let's just say

618
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,159
subsets because really it's the subsets

619
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,480
that I care about. Each one of them is a

620
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,960
pigeon. But perfect. All right. So,

621
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,640
that's exactly what the pigeons will be.

622
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,799
They'll just be the appropriate subsets.

623
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,919
So, in particular, I want them to be

624
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,240
non-MPY subsets. You know, that's

625
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,799
definitely one of the constraints I have

626
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,720
in this uh constraint on I and J right

627
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,720
here. I'll have to worry about this

628
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,760
disjointness constraint later and we'll

629
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,520
get to that. And then exactly as you

630
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,840
guys already mentioned, the holes are

631
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,320
going to be the possible sums. That's

632
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,080
exactly right.

633
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,520
So, you know, what can we say about the

634
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,840
possible sums, right? So let's say that

635
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,400
um the number of possible sums let's

636
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,400
just call that m I can just come up with

637
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,240
an upper bound right because I just need

638
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,880
to show that the number of holes is

639
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,400
smaller than the number of pigeons and

640
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,400
definitely an upper bound on this is you

641
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,320
know the largest that the sum can be

642
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,840
which is the sum from i= 1 to 20 of x

643
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:24,640
subi and this is comfortably less than

644
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:29,200
you know uh 20 *

645
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,919
10 4 which is strictly less than 10 6.

646
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,000
Was there a question here? No. Okay. All

647
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,840
right. So now we're in business because

648
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,159
we can try and appeal to the pigeon hole

649
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,960
principle again, right? But we have to

650
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,360
be a little bit careful here, right? So

651
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,600
what this is going to do is that um you

652
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:50,720
know the number of uh non-MPT subsets

653
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,320
well this is equal to

654
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,000
2 to the 20 minus one. So the way to

655
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,399
think about this and we'll talk more

656
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,080
about this when we get into counting is

657
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,480
really through what's called a bjection.

658
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,880
We'll do lots of examples of bjections,

659
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,880
but the way to think about that is that

660
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,440
each subset of the integers from 1 to 20

661
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,279
is really associated with a bit string.

662
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,720
The first coordinate, which is one or

663
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,679
zero, tells you whether the first

664
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,440
element is in the set or not. The second

665
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,159
entry in that string tells you whether

666
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,399
the second element is in it and so on.

667
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,159
So app priori there are 2 to the 20

668
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,159
possibilities because for each

669
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,080
coordinate I have the choice of whether

670
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,440
I include it or don't include it in my

671
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,159
subset. This minus one is because I want

672
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,880
the subset to be non-mpy. So I have to

673
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,399
rule out the subset that takes nothing.

674
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,760
Right? So this is still comfortably much

675
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,159
larger than 10 the 6. So now I'm in good

676
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,600
shape because n is strictly larger than

677
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,799
m. But there's a catch. So what exactly

678
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,960
does this imply? It implies when I use

679
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,960
the pigeon hole principle that there

680
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,960
exists non empty

681
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,279
A which is not equal to B, right?

682
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,840
Because there are different pigeons that

683
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:14,159
end up in the same pigeon hole. And yet

684
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,679
the sum is equal. The sum of all of the

685
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:23,520
X I's in the set A is equal to the sum

686
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:28,000
of all of the XJS in the set B. Right?

687
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,440
So I'm not done yet. Why am I not done?

688
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,200
Yes,

689
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,679
>> because the sets might not be

690
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,840
>> the sets might not be disjoint. Right?

691
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,000
So I haven't proven what I promised you

692
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,919
because I didn't meet this condition.

693
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,760
Also notice something about how I wrote

694
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,760
this proof, right? So I did not use I

695
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,760
injist

696
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,240
this inj and I already know that I'm not

697
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,960
done. So I left myself some slack in the

698
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,279
notation for me to later choose what I

699
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,679
inj should be. You know if I had made

700
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,960
these things be INJ, I would have really

701
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,120
confused my audience, right?

702
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,200
So, how exactly can we now make these

703
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,159
things disjoint? I claim we're almost

704
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,120
home. We just have to fix what A and B

705
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:21,440
are. So, anyone who hasn't answered yet,

706
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,120
have a fix for how I can fix A and B.

707
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,320
So, I've gotten most of it, they're non-

708
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,840
empty. Uh, have you answered yet? No.

709
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,360
Okay. All right.

710
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,799
>> Take the intersection of A and B and you

711
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,200
intersection from both sets.

712
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,960
>> That's right. That's right. So here,

713
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,640
let's think about a baby version of this

714
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,799
first before we explain it, you know,

715
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,279
with all of the full-blown mathematical

716
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,279
notation, right? You know, A and B might

717
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,000
not be disjoint because maybe they share

718
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,000
one element in common. Maybe they both

719
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,520
contain X1.

720
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,520
But then the point is that, you know,

721
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,159
these two sums are equal and they both

722
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,919
have an X1 in them. So I can just remove

723
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,559
that common element and then I'm

724
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,240
removing that X1 from the sum. when I

725
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,080
take it out, I've made the sets be

726
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,399
disjoint because they no longer share

727
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,080
that element in common. And yet, I

728
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,000
haven't changed the fact that the sums

729
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,200
are equal even though I've changed the

730
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,559
sums themselves. Right? So, that's, you

731
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,799
know, the rest of the proof. You're

732
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,200
exactly right. So, let's uh finish up

733
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,200
with that proof.

734
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,679
So the problem

735
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,480
is

736
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:36,720
A and B need not

737
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,640
be disjoint.

738
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,240
Now I'm deliberately trying to explain

739
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,480
you know a bit of like how I think about

740
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,960
the pedagogy of explaining these proofs

741
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,679
not just the proofs themselves. See one

742
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,840
of the things I could have done you know

743
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,559
for proving this is I could have just

744
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,000
told you what I want

745
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,360
you know a i and j to be. So in fact

746
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,039
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

747
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,159
define

748
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,600
uh you know i is equal to a minus b and

749
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,039
b j is equal to b minus a. So what this

750
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,679
notation means is I take my set A and I

751
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,399
remove every element that shows up in B

752
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,360
from that set and whatever I have left

753
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,120
over with is I. Now notice B does not

754
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,559
have to be a subset of A for this to

755
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,640
make sense. If B contains an element

756
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,480
that isn't an A, I just ignore that

757
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,279
element. It wasn't there before and I

758
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,840
keep it out of my set. But if B and A

759
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,000
both contain the element, then I I

760
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,240
remove it. So you can think about this

761
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,720
pictorially, right? You know, maybe

762
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,919
these two sets, you know, A and B, they

763
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,519
look like this. And so what is my set I

764
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,240
going to look like? It's going to be

765
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,600
exactly this shaded region right here

766
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,600
because they're, you know, I'm taking

767
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,679
out everything that belongs to B and

768
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,240
removing it from my set so that I create

769
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,960
two disjoint things. So this right here

770
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,880
would be I and this right here would be

771
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,240
J.

772
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,279
So let's think a little bit about

773
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,000
pedagogy again, right? You see how this

774
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,720
visual helps me understand what's going

775
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,600
on mathematically in the notation. If I

776
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,679
just define for you what a minus b is.

777
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,679
That's a perfectly valid definition,

778
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,360
right? But a lot of times these visuals

779
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,519
can help people understand them more

780
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,360
easily. And if you notice the other

781
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,600
thing I did in terms of writing up this

782
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,159
proof, I could have actually skipped

783
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,480
this entire discussion about what

784
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,519
happens when I choose A and B. I could

785
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,200
have jumped first to I and J, right? I

786
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,640
could have said A and B come from this

787
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,600
pigeonal principle and then I could have

788
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,840
defined I as A minus B and J as B minus

789
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,480
A. But then you would have missed the

790
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,240
point about why I needed to do that. So

791
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,760
in fact when you're writing up proofs

792
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,159
not everything you write is

793
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,720
mathematically necessary but a lot of

794
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,440
times it's pedagogically very useful

795
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,679
because you can walk the reader through

796
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,080
not just the formal verification that

797
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,559
the statement is true but how exactly

798
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,640
you arrived at the proof yourself.

799
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,640
Right? And the missteps you made along

800
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,279
the way, but that led you to the right

801
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,200
answer. All right? So, finishing this

802
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,000
up, we can just, you know, the rest of

803
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,240
it is just notation. So, when we look at

804
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,119
this expression, the sum over all x i in

805
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,560
the set a, we can break this up into two

806
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:26,879
pieces, right? It's the sum for all i

807
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:31,359
that are in both a and b of x i. And

808
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:35,440
it's the sum of all x i for i that

809
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,520
belongs to my set a i. capital i, which

810
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,520
is the things that belong here. So I'm

811
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,440
just taking the sum over this entire set

812
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,879
a and I'm breaking it up into this piece

813
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,359
right here and this piece right here.

814
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,839
But now by assumption I know using the

815
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,800
pigeon hole principle that this is the

816
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:56,480
same thing as the sum from

817
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,119
all i and b of x i. And I can break this

818
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,680
sum up the same way. It's the sum of all

819
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,680
I in the intersection

820
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:09,440
of X I plus the sum of all of these

821
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,040
things in my set capital J. Right? So

822
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,599
I'm just breaking up the sum two

823
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,359
different ways. And now when I take this

824
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,440
equation that the whole thing is equal,

825
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,839
I can just cross off these two pieces

826
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,200
because they're the same thing. And that

827
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,040
gives me what I want. These sets I and J

828
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,119
are definitely disjoint because I've

829
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,520
made them be disjoint and they have the

830
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,760
same sum. You should double check that

831
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,160
you never end up with these things being

832
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,160
non-MP and you know that's a

833
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,680
technicality you have to check but it is

834
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,160
true and it follows from the assumptions

835
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,680
but that's you know the end of our next

836
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,760
proof right so are there any questions

837
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,960
make sense?

838
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,520
Yeah,

839
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,720
>> the like

840
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,280
the minimum like number

841
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,480
>> it's about the minimum. Uh but since you

842
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,480
asked, let me tell you something

843
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,640
interesting about this, right? This lema

844
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,800
is very easy to state. It's not so bad

845
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,640
to prove. We proved it pretty quickly.

846
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,560
What's kind of shocking is, you know, I

847
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,040
can write down 24digit numbers for you.

848
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,520
And you would have no you could prove to

849
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,599
yourself using this proof right here

850
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,160
that there are two subsets whose sum is

851
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,640
the same. But it would be very hard to

852
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,640
actually find them. So you can do this

853
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,280
for example with like populations of

854
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,520
different countries. We know that there

855
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,240
are you know subsets of countries that

856
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,880
have literally the same number of people

857
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,440
but you know it would be exhaustive to

858
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,079
try and search all possible subsets to

859
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,680
figure out which pair collide and we

860
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,000
don't actually know any faster

861
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,920
algorithms and you know it's related to

862
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,839
some things in cryptography. All right

863
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,400
any other questions?

864
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,960
Make sense? so far. All right.

865
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,680
All right. So, we got to do our hardest

866
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,520
result today and then I'll do a uh fun

867
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,680
end for one of my favorite applications,

868
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,320
the pigeon hole principle.

869
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,920
So, let's do our hardest theorem. Uh,

870
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,280
and I'm going to, you know, tell you

871
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,520
it's the hardest result because I'm

872
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,359
going to call it a theorem.

873
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,280
And we'll be talking about extensions of

874
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,880
this, you know, on your first pet set.

875
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,480
So, you'll get more practice with this

876
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,079
proof.

877
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,240
But let me tell you about a beautiful

878
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,640
result in combinotaurics.

879
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,800
Right? What I claim is that in any

880
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,320
permutation,

881
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,920
I'll tell you what I mean by that in a

882
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,599
second. We'll be talking much more about

883
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:38,079
permutations later. Any permutation of

884
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:42,960
the integers 1 2 3 all the way up to

885
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:45,520
something n * m + one. What I claim is

886
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,720
that there is

887
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,720
an increasing subsequence

888
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,040
of length

889
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,280
m + one or a decreasing

890
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,720
subsequence

891
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,040
of length.

892
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,560
n + one. Okay, so I owe you a bunch of

893
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,000
things to explain what this theorem

894
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,400
means. Yes,

895
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,160
>> I'll get to that, but no, it's not. So

896
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,520
that's one of the things I owe you. But

897
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,079
first, let's start with the simpler

898
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,640
thing. So I owe you this, right? What do

899
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,440
I mean by a permutation? So what I mean

900
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,359
is you can take these integers 1 2 3 all

901
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,960
the way up to nm + one, right? n and m

902
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,200
are just parameters in this theorem

903
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,359
statement and instead of considering

904
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,760
them all in increasing order I can put

905
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,599
all of the numbers in any order I want.

906
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,680
So basically I take this deck of cards

907
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,000
and I shuffle it and I consider any

908
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,680
possible ordering. That's what I mean by

909
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,240
permutation. We'll talk more about them

910
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,160
formally later when we get to counting.

911
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,880
But you know I take any ordering for

912
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,960
these integers. And what I claim is that

913
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,760
there's some sort of subsequence where

914
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,040
the where the numbers are going up by

915
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,480
one at least at least one each time and

916
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,040
that's long or if not there's some long

917
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,400
subsequence where the numbers are going

918
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,160
down at least by one each time. So let's

919
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,079
do an example because I should really be

920
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,119
more precise by what I mean by a

921
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:29,359
subsequence. So let's take for example

922
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,599
m= n= 3. So then I'm really just asking

923
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,760
for a permutation of the integers from

924
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:37,040
one up to 10. So some shuffling of that

925
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:43,760
deck of cards. Let's take an example. We

926
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:49,280
could take 3 2 1 6 5 4

927
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:53,280
9 8 7 and then 10.

928
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,240
So now an example of a long increasing

929
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,760
sequence is this one right here. I take

930
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:03,359
three, then I take six, then I take

931
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,359
nine, and then I take 10. So this

932
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,359
sequence does not have to be contiguous.

933
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,800
These these positions I'm interested in

934
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,119
don't have to be right next to each

935
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,119
other. But what I want is that when I

936
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,720
consider the sequence of integers just

937
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,359
in those positions where I've put the

938
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,079
arrows, that the corresponding sequence

939
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,560
I get is strictly increasing as I go up

940
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,240
the arrows. So that's an increasing

941
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,359
subsequence. So I can also think about

942
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,880
having a decreasing one like 321 and

943
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,599
that's the longest decreasing

944
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,920
subsequence I can get here. So you can

945
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,240
see that this example illustrates a you

946
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,040
know it helps me understand what exactly

947
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,720
these abstract definitions mean like a

948
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,200
permutation and an increasing

949
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,440
subsequence. It also tells me something

950
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,079
even more powerful which is that this

951
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,760
theorem really is tight. Right? Because

952
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:55,599
in the case where n= m= 3, what I'm

953
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,920
promising you is that there is a length

954
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,040
for increasing subsequence or there's a

955
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,200
length for decreasing subsequence. And

956
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,079
even though I found one that has length

957
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,000
four and is increasing, what I claim in

958
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,960
this simple example is that I can't

959
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,359
create anything longer. And I can't even

960
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,480
create a decreasing subsequence that's

961
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,880
longer than three. Right? Because if I

962
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,839
did 321, then I'm in trouble. Everything

963
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,599
after it is larger. If I do 654 again,

964
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,839
I'm in trouble. Everything after it is

965
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,760
larger. All right, any questions?

966
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,599
So, I claim that we can prove this using

967
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,280
the pigeon hole principle, but we're

968
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,440
going to have the same difficulties we

969
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,680
usually have, which is where are the

970
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,760
pigeons and where are the holes. In

971
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,440
fact, it'll be even more abstract

972
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,680
because if you try and guess things

973
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,200
like, you know, the sequences are the

974
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,119
pigeons or the positions are the

975
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,880
pigeons, you're going to have a hard

976
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,359
time. That's not how this proof is going

977
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,960
to go. Instead, we're going to need a

978
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,240
very delicate definition to tell us

979
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,760
where the pigeons are and you know how

980
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,760
this relates to the pigeon hole

981
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,760
principle.

982
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,480
And the idea basically is that um you

983
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,920
know I can't like this theorem if you

984
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,760
think about it is not telling me which

985
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,440
of them I have whether I have a long

986
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,839
increasing or a long decreasing

987
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,680
sequence. So in some sense what I want

988
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,400
to do is I want to keep track of my

989
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,640
progress on both of them. How long is my

990
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,520
largest increasing subsequence? How long

991
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,200
is my largest decreasing sequence? And I

992
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,560
want to see how those progress measures

993
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,319
grow.

994
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,599
So the proof is going to involve this

995
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,880
very careful you know definition

996
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,119
is you know let's consider

997
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,200
these integers in order and let's

998
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,359
consider the

999
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:50,839
sith elements

1000
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,839
in the sequence

1001
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,400
and what we're going to do

1002
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,240
is we're going to define these helper

1003
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,680
variables. So we're going to let I subs

1004
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:09,440
denote the length

1005
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,200
of the longest

1006
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,200
increasing

1007
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,200
subsequence

1008
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,200
ending

1009
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,200
at the eth ess.

1010
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Okay, that's one progress measure. I is

1011
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,280
for increasing. So I've chosen, you

1012
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,160
know, notation that uh at least has a

1013
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,720
pneummonic associated with it. I have DS

1014
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,240
is going to be the same thing, but it'll

1015
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,240
be the longest decreasing

1016
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,000
subsequence, but again ending at the

1017
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,319
Sith location.

1018
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,800
Okay,

1019
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,280
so uh this is my progress measure. In

1020
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,119
fact, this is a little bit abstract. So

1021
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,319
let's see what it looks like in this

1022
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:05,319
particular example just to make sense of

1023
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,319
it.

1024
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,880
So for example in the example we already

1025
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:15,880
did I can plot you know how I and D

1026
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
change

1027
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:25,040
as a function of uh

1028
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:29,200
oh let's see okay so what I can do is

1029
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:34,560
I'm going to consider this sequence 5 2

1030
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,880
4 3 6 1 just to keep it interesting.

1031
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,520
And now what I can do is when I look at

1032
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,359
each one of these positions, I can look

1033
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,839
at this progress measure of what's the

1034
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,079
longest increasing sequence that ends at

1035
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,079
that position. So when I start off,

1036
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,160
what's the longest increasing sequence

1037
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,359
that ends at this first position

1038
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,079
occupied by five? One.

1039
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:59,200
What's the longest decreasing? It's one,

1040
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:02,079
right? And now if I instead, you know,

1041
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,680
consider the position two. So if I

1042
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,079
consider the second position that has

1043
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,560
the element two in it, what is the

1044
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,520
longest increasing subsequence that ends

1045
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,119
at that position that includes this

1046
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,119
value two? Any ideas? This just a matter

1047
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,480
of using the definition, but the

1048
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,480
definition requires a little bit of

1049
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,480
unwrapping.

1050
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:29,440
Any ideas?

1051
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,359
One. Perfect. That's one.

1052
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,920
because the longest increasing sequence

1053
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,079
that ends and includes two. Well, if I

1054
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,000
include two, I can't include five

1055
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,839
because it's supposed to be increasing.

1056
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,440
What about this position right here? So,

1057
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,119
what should I fill in for this entry in

1058
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,440
the table? Two. Perfect. So, I can keep

1059
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,520
track of this, right? If instead I end

1060
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,520
at the position four, then I can include

1061
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:57,119
two. So, I'm fine. Uh here my longest

1062
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,800
decreasing would be 54. And I can keep

1063
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:06,240
track of this progress measure. I'll get

1064
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:08,319
2 3 3 1 1 4. Okay. And now you know

1065
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,720
here's the key for how it relates to the

1066
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:14,000
pigeon hole principle. What I claim is

1067
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,119
that for two locations S and T that are

1068
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,079
different from each other. I claim that

1069
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:27,200
this pair is S Ds is not equal to the

1070
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:29,920
pair it T DT. Okay,

1071
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,599
so that's the key

1072
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,160
and if we can show this, this is really

1073
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,640
the heart of the proof because you know

1074
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,240
this sequence goes on for you know

1075
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,400
roughly n * m length

1076
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,960
and you know if my pigeon hole principle

1077
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,440
if my the sequence statement were false

1078
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,000
and I could only get a value of like n

1079
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,560
here and a value of m here then I just

1080
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,119
wouldn't have enough possibilities to

1081
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,640
pre you know to avoid a collision.

1082
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,160
So you can put the pieces of it

1083
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,520
together, but this is really the heart

1084
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,920
of the proof is proving this statement.

1085
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,440
So let's prove this. This is not a hard

1086
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,440
statement to prove, but it's a hard

1087
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,920
statement to guess is the right way to

1088
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,040
go about it. So how are we going to

1089
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,440
prove this thing?

1090
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,440
So first,

1091
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:23,200
does anyone know what this term right

1092
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,440
here means? WLG.

1093
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,240
Just out of curiosity. Yeah. Without

1094
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,480
loserelli. Okay. So, you know, I told

1095
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,560
you that when I was proving things with

1096
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,839
um you know, the number of people in a

1097
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,560
party that I had to do this case

1098
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,720
analysis. Well, to prevent my proof from

1099
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,040
being too long, let me just pretend s is

1100
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,480
larger than t because you know, if it

1101
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,319
was the other way around, I would just

1102
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,319
switch what's s and what's t. So yeah,

1103
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,319
>> why

1104
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,960
wouldn't the most the longest increasing

1105
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,839
one with six as the last one be six and

1106
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,280
two?

1107
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,480
>> Sorry. Uh which entry in the table here?

1108
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah.

1109
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,839
>> Yeah. Three and six.

1110
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,480
>> Okay. All right. So here, right? So uh

1111
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:13,040
we want the longest increasing sequence

1112
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,880
that ends at three. that six.

1113
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,680
>> So do you want this entry in the table?

1114
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:22,119
Okay. So the longest increasing one that

1115
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,119
ends at six. So what would it be?

1116
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,720
>> Yeah. Yeah. So it's not required to be

1117
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,440
contiguous but it has to include that

1118
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,760
end point. So that's why these numbers

1119
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,720
you know are not u monotonically

1120
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,440
increasing right. So when I have the

1121
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,160
longest decreasing sequence that ends at

1122
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:45,359
three, you know, that's pretty long,

1123
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,839
right? Because I could go 5 43 and end

1124
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,160
there. But as soon as I move over to

1125
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,880
this next column right here, if I have

1126
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,800
to end at six, that that that makes the

1127
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,880
longest decreasing sequence only of

1128
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,200
length one. So the key is that I'm

1129
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,680
fixing that my end point has to belong

1130
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,440
to that subsequence and I'm considering

1131
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,280
progress as I go, you know, left to

1132
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,880
right. So any other questions? This is a

1133
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,480
crucial part. If you don't understand

1134
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,359
the table, you won't understand the

1135
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:18,160
proof. Good. All right. So without loss

1136
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:22,640
generality, S is larger than T, right?

1137
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:25,599
And so let's do the following. So if the

1138
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:30,920
element

1139
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,920
at the Sith location

1140
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:39,440
is strictly larger than the elements

1141
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,319
at the tth

1142
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:48,400
location,

1143
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:51,400
what I claim is that is at least it t +

1144
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,400
1.

1145
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,440
It's the morning and I'm lazy. So, who

1146
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,240
can prove this for me and and justify

1147
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,720
this? Why is this true? Someone who

1148
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,200
hasn't answered. Especially my back row

1149
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,200
is very quiet.

1150
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,800
Yeah,

1151
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,119
that's exactly right. So, let me say

1152
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,760
that again. Right. So, we can just use

1153
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,880
the increasing sequence subsequence that

1154
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,680
ended at the tth location. And because

1155
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,599
the element at the sth location is after

1156
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,760
the one that happens at the tth location

1157
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,480
because s is larger than t and the

1158
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,720
element itself is bigger too. I can just

1159
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,400
append that element and make my

1160
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:48,160
subsequence longer. Right? All right. So

1161
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,760
how does the rest of the proof go? Um

1162
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,440
who can fill in the rest of the proof

1163
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,040
for me?

1164
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,359
So this is one case in the case

1165
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:59,040
analysis. Right? I've said without loss

1166
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,800
generality s is larger than t and um you

1167
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,800
know if the element at the sith location

1168
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,520
is larger than the element at the tth

1169
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,880
location my is at least it t + one

1170
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,760
>> uh yeah

1171
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,040
>> uh you do the same thing with generality

1172
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,280
s instead the element at the s location

1173
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,319
is less than the element at e location

1174
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,280
then you can do the same for um

1175
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,000
ds and d

1176
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,000
>> perfect that's

1177
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,160
And it's basically the same reasoning

1178
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,079
but backwards. So otherwise in

1179
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,319
particular if the element at the sith

1180
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,800
location is strictly less than the

1181
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:37,119
element at the tth location, I can just

1182
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,160
take the decreasing subsequence that

1183
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,920
ends at the tth location and append what

1184
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,760
happens at the sith location. That's

1185
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,359
smaller. So that's a valid decreasing

1186
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,599
sequence. And that's the proof, right? I

1187
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,880
just proved for you that these two pairs

1188
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,480
of integers are different because I

1189
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,200
showed you that either this one is

1190
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,240
larger than this or this one is larger

1191
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,839
than this. Right? And now we're in good

1192
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,920
shape because you know how does the

1193
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:06,319
entire thing you know work. So just

1194
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,319
returning to the proof putting it all

1195
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,319
together

1196
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,440
even though I sort of said it in words

1197
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,440
let's just be precise about it.

1198
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,800
So returning to the proof.

1199
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,240
Let's suppose the theorem is false

1200
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,960
for the purposes of contradiction.

1201
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,520
Right? Then what I claim is that there

1202
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:45,480
are

1203
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,480
at most nm possible

1204
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:54,079
values

1205
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:55,680
for these pairs is ds, right? Because

1206
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,200
that's what it means for the theorem to

1207
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,760
be false. There's no n +1 length

1208
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,760
increasing subsequence. There's no

1209
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,240
length m plus one decreasing

1210
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,079
subsequence. When I look at my pairs of

1211
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,880
integers, is never becomes larger than n

1212
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:17,440
and ds never becomes larger than m.

1213
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,599
Right? And these are, you know, my holes

1214
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,559
is because each one of the possible

1215
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,400
positions is going to get mapped just by

1216
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,839
this definition that I gave you right

1217
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,240
here of isds to the signature of these

1218
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:34,079
pair of integers. That just tells me the

1219
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:39,040
name of my hole. But you know how long

1220
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:41,839
is my sequence? There are n m + one

1221
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,760
values in the sequence. These are all my

1222
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:50,240
pigeons.

1223
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:55,599
Which by the pigeon hole principle means

1224
00:53:50,240 --> 00:54:00,240
there is s not equal to t with

1225
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:04,480
that collide in some hole with is ds

1226
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,400
equal to it dt. That's what it means for

1227
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,400
them to collide to the same hole because

1228
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,960
they get mapped to the same thing. And

1229
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,400
we know that that's impossible, right?

1230
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,359
But this is impossible.

1231
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,359
So that contradicts the assumption we

1232
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,520
made at the beginning which was just

1233
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,520
that the theorem was false. Yes.

1234
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,160
>> Without loss of generality step, why are

1235
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,000
we comparing um if I plus one instead of

1236
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,000
directive?

1237
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
>> Uh sorry, say it again. So why are we

1238
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,079
comparing uh

1239
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,559
>> compare that to I of T + one instead of

1240
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,680
tot? Okay, so just to be careful right

1241
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,119
here, this is I subt and then plus one

1242
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,359
is outside.

1243
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,440
>> Yeah. So this is really just saying that

1244
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,240
whatever my length of my increasing

1245
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,119
sequence is right here, this value right

1246
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,520
here, I can add one to the length. So

1247
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,720
the plus one is not in the subscript.

1248
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,680
>> Does that make sense?

1249
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,359
>> Um why not?

1250
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,880
>> Would it hold true that is is strictly

1251
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,640
greater than I or

1252
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,640
>> uh is is strictly greater? Yes,

1253
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,559
definitely. is is definitely strictly

1254
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,599
greater than it because these are

1255
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,240
integers.

1256
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,280
>> Yeah. In fact, you know, is is not

1257
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,119
necessarily equal to it + one because

1258
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,079
there might be some totally different

1259
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,760
other subsequence that's way longer that

1260
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,480
just doesn't involve what happens at the

1261
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,480
tth location. But all right, any other

1262
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,040
questions? This was our hardest proof

1263
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,040
for today. Yeah.

1264
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,720
>> Yeah. So, the pigeons, this is why I

1265
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,640
told you you have to be a little bit

1266
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,359
careful with this, right? The pigeons

1267
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,760
are actually the positions.

1268
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:42,160
So what's happening here is each one of

1269
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,760
these positions, the first element, the

1270
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,680
second element, the third element, the

1271
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,920
fourth element, the fifth, the sixth,

1272
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,559
these are my pigeons. How are they

1273
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,440
getting mapped to a hole? Is I map them

1274
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:56,680
to the hole whose name is this integer,

1275
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,680
this integer.

1276
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,920
>> It's just the Paris right here.

1277
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:04,559
>> It's the Paris. So my holes that's why I

1278
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,599
drew the little hole right there is that

1279
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:10,960
this is the name of the hole and by

1280
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:14,720
assumption if the theorem is false is

1281
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,920
doesn't go larger than N ds doesn't go

1282
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:21,920
larger than m so there are at most n*

1283
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,000
you know m possibilities for this

1284
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,599
yeah

1285
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,440
>> maybe you could have guessed this kind

1286
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,960
of thing

1287
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,880
as a product

1288
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,720
>> but like if

1289
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,799
I guess if it didn't have this like nice

1290
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,520
type.

1291
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,000
>> Yeah.

1292
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,640
>> How how would you

1293
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,640
>> math is hard? [laughter]

1294
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,720
I mean, we're teaching you things which

1295
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,640
like, you know, we're not going to give

1296
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,280
you this on a test and ask you to

1297
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:51,920
miraculously guess it. But for example,

1298
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,760
we will ask you on the pet set to do a

1299
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,000
version of this with, you know, three

1300
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,799
types of subsequences. and you're gonna

1301
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,400
have this as a blueprint to go off of to

1302
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,079
try and understand, you know, what's

1303
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,920
going on. So, this would be

1304
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,000
extraordinarily clever if you just came

1305
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,839
up with this on the spot. There are also

1306
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,960
twists to very simple problems that will

1307
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,680
make things very difficult and open, but

1308
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,400
um yeah, let's go with it. All right,

1309
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:20,760
any other questions?

1310
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,760
Good. All right. Yeah.

1311
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:30,000
>> Well, okay. That's maybe a bit of um a

1312
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,160
digression but you know basically if I

1313
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,079
like this really mimics if you've taken

1314
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,640
algorithms classes like a dynamic

1315
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,319
programming type of solution because you

1316
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,799
know if I want to know what is the

1317
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:42,480
longest subsequence that ends here I

1318
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:45,119
really want to piece it together by

1319
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,359
answers to sub problems before and this

1320
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,720
often has this structure is that you

1321
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,040
know once I tell you that the

1322
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,280
subsequence includes this element and

1323
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,440
it's increasing I don't actually have to

1324
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,440
know anything else about which elements

1325
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,200
belong to it. I just have to know it's

1326
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,359
increasing and its length and the fact

1327
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,040
that it belongs to it in order to be

1328
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:05,440
able to piece together what happens to

1329
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,280
the rest. So this you know a lot of

1330
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,599
these things in mathematics they really

1331
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,119
mimic what we do algorithmically in

1332
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,200
terms of how we would go about finding

1333
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,880
it. And we'll see that more and more in

1334
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,319
class. That's true even when it comes to

1335
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:23,440
like writing proof and writing code.

1336
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:26,319
Okay. Good. All right. So, let's do uh

1337
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:30,000
one of my favorite examples

1338
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:34,400
um of the pigeon hole principle.

1339
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,160
Does anyone want to be my victim?

1340
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,000
Oh, boy. You guys volunteered very

1341
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,839
quickly. [laughter]

1342
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,599
All right. Uh sure. Can you tell me

1343
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,599
about You can stay there. Uh can you

1344
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,960
tell me something about yourself? Um you

1345
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,839
know, where you're from, what your name

1346
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,079
is, introduce yourself to the class.

1347
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:53,520
>> I'm Anthony. I'm from St. Louis,

1348
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:55,119
Missouri. Um

1349
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,680
uh I don't know.

1350
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,400
>> Do you have any hobbies?

1351
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:04,319
>> Uh

1352
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,480
oh. Um I have a two letter curve.

1353
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:10,079
>> Okay.

1354
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,520
Wow. All right. [laughter]

1355
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,160
There are not many possibilities for

1356
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:17,760
that one. All right. Now I can uh just

1357
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:20,240
based on that using my MIT superpowers

1358
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,359
I can tell you something deeply personal

1359
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:27,040
about your you know life history

1360
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:29,440
in your family tree. It's not a tree and

1361
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,720
I know that for a fact. So we're going

1362
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,040
to prove that using the pigeon hole

1363
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,520
principle. I should confess that I once

1364
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,359
used this in 042 and I asked for a

1365
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,079
volunteer or a victim. That's why I call

1366
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:41,839
it a victim now. And uh you know the

1367
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,680
girl raised her hand and told me a bit

1368
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:46,000
about herself and I told her you know

1369
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,480
your family tree is not a family tree.

1370
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,960
And then she got very red and she said I

1371
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,640
know.

1372
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,400
And I've been a little bit scared to use

1373
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,040
this since then. So that's why I call it

1374
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,640
a victim. So you signed up for it. But

1375
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,119
it's not really just true about you.

1376
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,040
It's true about everyone in class. It's

1377
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:06,240
just a mathematical fact that follows

1378
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:08,799
from some very basic axioms of biology.

1379
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,720
things which are you know

1380
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:13,040
you really can't poke holes in and it's

1381
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,799
true for all of us. So let me tell you

1382
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,559
about this fun application of the pigeon

1383
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:19,200
hole principle. First let me state you

1384
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,440
know the lema and then we'll figure out

1385
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,520
as usual like how to model it and how

1386
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:28,960
exactly to think about it as pigeons and

1387
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:34,040
holes. So you know what I claim

1388
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,040
is that everyone everyone's

1389
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,960
family tree

1390
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,960
contains

1391
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:49,160
someone

1392
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,160
whose parents are blood relatives.

1393
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,319
It's just true.

1394
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,680
Okay. So now I'm just going to assert

1395
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:06,160
some you know very incontrovertible

1396
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,680
things biologically that are pretty safe

1397
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,640
but this will be enough to be able to

1398
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,920
prove this fact.

1399
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,640
So let's you know do the setup for this.

1400
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:21,000
So what are the axioms we're using? So

1401
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,000
first of all, you know, everyone

1402
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:27,559
has

1403
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,559
two biological parents.

1404
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,319
Of course, if I removed biological, it

1405
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,400
would be more complicated, but I'm just

1406
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,960
saying this biologically. Everyone has

1407
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,000
two biological parents.

1408
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:43,839
Uh, no one

1409
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,160
has children

1410
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:49,440
after 100.

1411
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:53,400
Seems pretty safe.

1412
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,400
Uh, the human race

1413
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:04,480
is at least 4,000 years old.

1414
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,640
That's a very safe assumption.

1415
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,440
And this is something that can be you

1416
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,920
know checked by a bi biologist is that

1417
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,599
um you know we have upper bounds for the

1418
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,920
number of total humans who've ever

1419
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:20,559
lived. What I claim is that there are at

1420
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:24,280
most 10 the 12 humans who've lived all

1421
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,280
throughout history

1422
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,359
and just from these axioms I claim that

1423
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,760
we can prove this.

1424
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:33,760
So let's prove it

1425
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,680
and we have to figure out the right

1426
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,160
mathematical abstraction for how to

1427
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,640
think about this. Right? It's the same

1428
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:43,760
way as the you know friends at a party

1429
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:48,160
where we had this way of thinking about

1430
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,760
it as degrees in a graph right and what

1431
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,680
we can do here is we can do the same

1432
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:56,280
kind of thing but we can trace back our

1433
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,280
family tree right

1434
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,520
in essence what I'm doing when I trace

1435
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:08,079
back this family tree is I'm defining a

1436
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,040
whole bunch of nodes who have jobs or

1437
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:14,000
roles in your family tree. So there's

1438
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:19,039
you at the start. Then if I trace it

1439
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:23,160
back, you have your parents.

1440
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,160
If I trace it back further,

1441
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,559
I have your grandparents.

1442
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:38,559
And when I do this, right,

1443
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:41,839
I'm going to trace this back at least

1444
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:44,960
40 generations, right? Because human

1445
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:47,119
history is at least 4,000 years old and

1446
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,200
no one has children, you know, after a

1447
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:54,240
100. So I get at least that my depth,

1448
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:57,240
you know, is at least 40. So what this

1449
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,240
means

1450
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:05,599
is that there are at least 2 to the 40

1451
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:08,559
nodes in this abstract family tree which

1452
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:12,240
are just job descriptions right you know

1453
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,400
your maternal father of your you know I

1454
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,559
mean all the way back of uh tracing all

1455
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,480
the possibilities

1456
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:23,440
and the trouble is that um you know but

1457
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,920
2 to the 40 is larger

1458
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:31,039
is strictly larger than 10 cub raised to

1459
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,200
the 4th power, right? Because 2 10 is

1460
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,760
larger than a thousand.

1461
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:38,400
And so this is larger than the number of

1462
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,119
nodes all of the possibilities all the

1463
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,359
possible humans in human history. So by

1464
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:46,920
the pigeonal principle what we get is

1465
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,920
that at least

1466
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:55,160
two nodes two jobs get mapped

1467
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,160
to the same person.

1468
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:03,280
So that's pretty cool. This is just a

1469
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:06,400
mathematical fact that uh you can use on

1470
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,079
your friends to annoy them. Um please

1471
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,839
don't do that.

1472
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,000
Uh so this is what I wanted to tell you

1473
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,440
about the pigeon hole principle. Now as

1474
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,280
I told you we're going to be covering a

1475
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,440
bunch of introductory topics in the

1476
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,599
first few lectures. So you know pigeon

1477
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,920
hole principle will get more practice on

1478
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,680
the pet sets. Uh we're actually going to

1479
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,160
be spending the next couple of lectures

1480
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,000
on probability and then counting. So

1481
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,760
we'll also be talking a little bit about

1482
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,559
elementary probability in the first

1483
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,319
recitation the first homework. So let me

1484
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,520
tell you at least about the formalisms

1485
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,000
for probability and then we're going to

1486
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,119
go into a lot more detail over the next

1487
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,640
couple lectures that I'll be explaining.

1488
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,359
So let me tell you about you know

1489
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,880
probability just as an intro for later

1490
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,799
lectures.

1491
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:53,799
Um and we're going to connect all of

1492
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,799
this obviously to counting as well.

1493
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,079
So basically in class especially for our

1494
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,359
later topics everything is going to be

1495
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,799
built on counting one way or another.

1496
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:06,280
uh we're going to use it for all kinds

1497
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:06,280
of fun things,

1498
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,960
but let me give you a little bit of

1499
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,039
motivation before we get there. So,

1500
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,000
we're going to be focusing mostly on

1501
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,000
discrete probability.

1502
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,200
So, why study discrete probability?

1503
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:26,240
Well, it's very useful for things like,

1504
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,960
you know, counting.

1505
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,599
uh you want to understand you know basic

1506
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,760
setups like um you know what are the

1507
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:36,000
chances of creating certain kinds of

1508
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,640
objects that are nice when you choose an

1509
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,559
object at random. Uh that's very related

1510
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,920
to counting and it's intertwined with

1511
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,400
you know basic questions about

1512
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,720
probability. You know, later when we do

1513
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,839
more advanced topics, we're going to use

1514
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:52,559
probability in really cool ways to show

1515
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:55,359
the existence of very strange, you know,

1516
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,359
objects that are otherwise hard to

1517
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,799
construct. And we're going to be doing

1518
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,599
this through something called the

1519
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:03,680
probabilistic method.

1520
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,599
It's another example where you can use

1521
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,079
the language of probability to show that

1522
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,920
these very strange objects exist even

1523
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,400
though no one knows how to find any

1524
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,799
particular one. So it's kind of like the

1525
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,160
way that we reasoned about those subsets

1526
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:20,079
of sums of 20 of uh four-digit numbers

1527
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,160
that we knew that there were subsets

1528
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,799
whose sum was the same without actually

1529
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,880
knowing which ones.

1530
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,880
Uh later when we talk a little bit more

1531
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,880
about, you know, some topics in

1532
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,880
algorithms,

1533
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:40,640
you know, things like primality testing

1534
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:43,119
using some of the elementary number

1535
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,760
theory that we do, deciding whether a

1536
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,599
given huge integer is prime or not.

1537
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,520
It'll turn out that fundamentally these

1538
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,960
algorithms are randomized. So really to

1539
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,160
reason about it, we'll have to have the

1540
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:56,880
language of probability to begin with.

1541
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,480
And you know much later in class uh when

1542
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,880
we talk about things like you know

1543
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,000
coding theory we're going to use

1544
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:06,480
probability intrinsically to model types

1545
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,079
of communication

1546
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,079
for example when there's noise between

1547
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,400
us like when a satellite is sending

1548
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:14,799
images back to earth you know what are

1549
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:17,120
ways to reliably communicate in the face

1550
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:18,960
of you know errors that are introduced

1551
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,279
when one party's communicating with the

1552
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,679
other so we're going to use probability

1553
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:25,199
in all of these different contexts.

1554
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,000
I want to give you a little bit of the

1555
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:31,199
setup for um you know probability before

1556
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,880
we get into a lot of the you know key

1557
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:37,679
rules and definitions next time.

1558
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,400
So probability

1559
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,839
even though [clears throat] it's

1560
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,640
familiar to all of us it uses some very

1561
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:46,400
powerful abstractions and definitions.

1562
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,120
So the most important of which is what's

1563
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,520
called the sample space.

1564
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,759
So in a basic probabilistic setup the

1565
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:58,279
way to think about it is that you know

1566
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,279
points in the sample space.

1567
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,640
We associate them with you know possible

1568
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:07,920
outcomes

1569
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:11,359
things that can happen

1570
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,679
out of the range of all possibilities.

1571
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,359
You know, just to do a familiar example,

1572
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,839
we could do something like, you know,

1573
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,839
roll a dieice.

1574
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,080
And if it's a,

1575
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,560
you know, normal die, we have six

1576
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,080
possibilities. That's our sample space

1577
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,839
because that describes all of the

1578
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,920
possible things that could happen. What

1579
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:33,679
number shows up?

1580
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,759
Now, the important thing is not just

1581
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,359
what's the range of possibilities, but

1582
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,920
really, you know, what's the likelihood

1583
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:44,839
of each of these different outcomes.

1584
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,839
Um so to each point

1585
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,719
X in the sample space we're going to

1586
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:54,480
assign

1587
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:57,040
some probability P of X which has the

1588
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,320
following properties. These are all very

1589
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,120
intuitive. So we need that the

1590
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,199
probability is non- negative and this

1591
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,480
should be true for all points in the

1592
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:08,640
sample space. And we want that in total

1593
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,360
the sum of all the probabilities over

1594
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:15,199
the entire sample space

1595
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:17,520
is one. So these are the things that

1596
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,120
define you know the setup for basic

1597
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,360
probability. We have a sample space and

1598
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,360
we have this probability associated with

1599
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,040
each one of the outcomes. We can

1600
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,760
certainly do simple examples like

1601
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,600
rolling a dice. If it's a fair die then

1602
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,840
each one of these possibilities has one

1603
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,840
sixth probability. We're going to do a

1604
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,280
lot more exotic examples in class. you

1605
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,960
know, things where the sample space

1606
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,800
might be infinite. That's perfectly

1607
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,600
fine. We can still have these axioms

1608
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,600
hold. Um, you know, an example of

1609
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,760
something we might be interested in is

1610
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,640
the number of times we flip a coin

1611
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,640
before we see our first heads. That in

1612
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,480
principle can go on, you know, forever.

1613
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,120
There's no bound on how large that

1614
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,040
sample space is. And we can still talk

1615
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,719
about all of the basic axioms of

1616
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:03,520
probability and and reason about things.

1617
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:07,800
Um, and we'll be particularly interested

1618
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,800
in what are called events.

1619
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,920
So events are just subsets of the sample

1620
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,280
space.

1621
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,920
They're just some subset of

1622
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,320
possibilities. And in that case we can

1623
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,280
think about this probability of the

1624
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,840
entire event as just the sum of all of

1625
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:33,040
the individual outcomes that land in

1626
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:36,040
this event their total probability.

1627
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,040
Right?

1628
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:42,080
So for example you could think about an

1629
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:45,080
event like uh you know rolling an even

1630
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,080
number.

1631
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,640
That's not just one possible outcome in

1632
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,520
the sample space, but you know it's the

1633
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:58,560
set 2 46.

1634
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:02,000
And uh you know the last you know little

1635
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,760
baby piece of um you know background is

1636
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,760
that we'll also be interested in you

1637
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,320
know complements

1638
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,800
of events.

1639
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,000
So for example I could look at the

1640
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:16,560
probability of you know t bar. Sometimes

1641
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,360
you'll see it written as not T as well.

1642
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,520
And that's just you know everything that

1643
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,000
you know is in the sample space outside

1644
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,320
the set T. So for example this is

1645
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,640
defined as all of the points and the

1646
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:31,040
outcome space that don't occur in this

1647
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,880
original event. Um so we can define this

1648
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,960
notion of complimentary events which is

1649
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:38,480
you know everything else besides the

1650
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,000
events in T. Uh you know basic fact is

1651
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,000
that a lot of these things behave the

1652
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
way you'd expect them to. So the

1653
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,960
probability of the complement is just

1654
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,719
one minus the probability of the event

1655
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,719
itself. There's a very simple proof. Um

1656
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,920
we can we're going to stop now but I'll

1657
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,320
tell you a little bit about what we're

1658
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,400
going to be doing next time. So now that

1659
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,239
we know at least the basic definitions

1660
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,000
for probability theory, we're going to

1661
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,760
be talking about conditional probability

1662
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,760
which is always something that's very

1663
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,280
counterintuitive. So we're going to

1664
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,719
define what conditional probabilities

1665
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,040
are. I'll tell you some of the basic

1666
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,400
results in conditional probability and

1667
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,199
then I'm going to give you a lot of fun

1668
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,280
examples of um you know how people get

1669
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,640
conditional probability wrong. So there

1670
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,480
are a lot of famous examples like the

1671
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,800
Monty Hall problem that many of you may

1672
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,040
have seen. Uh you know for me this was

1673
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,280
always a little bit abstract like it's a

1674
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:29,600
cute mathematical puzzle but I'm going

1675
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,440
to give you some scarier examples of you

1676
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,600
know real world things that happen with

1677
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,679
doctors where they misinterpret

1678
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,040
conditional probabilities. So, we'll do

1679
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,360
that next time and I'll tell you some

1680
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:42,679
personal stories about that one. So, see

1681
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,679
you on Thursday.
