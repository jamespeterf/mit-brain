1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Right.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,880
So this here is just to make sure that

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,520
you at the right place. This is uh 18

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760
100B

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,760
or uh 18

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:34,119
uh 0 uh 100 uh and two.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,119
Um and my name is Toby. So Toby coding

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,600
and uh by so we will be uh recorded uh

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,760
and the video from the lecture will be

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,280
posted online

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,440
uh and I will also write uh lecture

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
notes. I hope you appreciate it because

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
it I wrote the first one. It actually

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,239
took me quite a long time. I don't

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,559
typically uh type the lecture notes but

16
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:05,920
I will do this for this class. Um and I

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,920
also wanted to just give you an idea of

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,560
the structure. First of all, this is one

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,320
of the most important math classes at

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
MIT.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,159
Uh and I'll tell you in a minute why it

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
is important. And of course I think that

23
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,439
being one of the most important math

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,320
classes is one of the most important

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:29,360
classes period. uh but um right but so

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,240
just to give you an idea of what's uh

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:37,560
the what will be expected from the class

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,560
so there would be uh 10 weekly homework

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,680
uh and the first one

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,040
the first one uh will be due it won't be

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,479
due next week it will probably be due

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,799
the week after next week and the and in

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,320
part it just allow you to kind of get

34
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,600
settle in a bit. But also um I'm waiting

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,280
for somebody else to assign the TA and

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,840
the graders. So it will be I think it

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,160
will be at least one graduate TA and

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,879
there will be some undergraduate uh uh

39
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,879
TAs and then there will also probably be

40
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,200
some graders and uh and most of these

41
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,239
including myself will have office hours

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
also. So it'll be 10 weekly weekly

43
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,000
homework.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,000
There will be a midterm. So one midterm

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,800
and one final.

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,959
And the midterm is on March 20th.

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,080
And the the final u is uh I don't know

48
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,120
when it is. it's uh I'm not the one that

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,360
is uh deciding the date and it would be

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
a while before we know what date that

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,360
will be.

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,080
And so and in terms of the grade uh the

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,000
homework will count for 50% of your

54
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,800
grades. Uh midterm will count for 20%

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,800
and the final for 30%.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,640
And you can see all this information

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,360
about this uh in there's a syllabus and

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,280
a course information posted uh in on the

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,080
Canvas. So right so make sure to check

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,080
out the Canvas site

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,040
for the class and there's also the

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,440
information about the book and also the

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,760
lecture notes will be posted on the

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,480
Canvas site. The lecture notes I think

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,879
will probably be posted on the files. So

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,879
lecture notes

67
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,959
uh will be posted under files

68
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,080
and one other thing is that uh that I

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
have activated what's called pet

70
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,319
partners

71
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,159
Right. So you are encouraged to uh to

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,920
work with other people on the pets but

73
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,560
you have everybody have to hand in their

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,759
own pets. Okay. Uh and and pet partners

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,240
is a way of finding uh other people uh

76
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,960
to work with. I mean of course you can

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,520
do it another way but but this is a tool

78
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
that is used in in a lot of classes.

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,880
Okay, I think this sort of covered the

80
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,120
basic information

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,639
and so the class here is so um the the

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,960
the two key topics for this class is so

83
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,960
key topics

84
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,759
uh is uh one is to uh you will learn how

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,040
to write

86
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,040
uh a mathematical proof.

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,240
So what does it mean to to to write

88
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,120
something so that it's kind of ma

89
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,960
mathematically rigorous and the second

90
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,360
thing that you will learn is how to

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,360
prove themsel

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,639
of this

93
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,960
that suppose you have a function.

94
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,280
So suppose you have some interval. So a

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,840
and b are real numbers and you have a

96
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,639
function f

97
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,199
defined on this interval

98
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,560
and they take real values

99
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,800
and so here you have the interval here a

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,600
here's b and assume that the value at

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,160
let's say that the value at a is

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,680
negative and the value at the other end

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,240
point b is positive right so you have so

104
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,919
if You sort of were drawing the graph.

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Here you have a maybe here you have b

106
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,280
and then the function initially is

107
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,800
negative and it end up being positive.

108
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,560
So this is f of a here you have f of b

109
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,560
and then this function here is

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
continuous.

111
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,560
So the function sort of looks maybe like

112
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,560
this.

113
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,720
Um so f is continuous. So the

114
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,280
intermediate value theorem say

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,280
so there.

116
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,479
So the intermediate value theorem

117
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,560
value theorem

118
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,120
it say the following that if you have a

119
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,639
continuous function on an interval then

120
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,720
it takes all values in between. Right?

121
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,000
So the intermediate var say in

122
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,000
particular that there exist

123
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:36,960
a c and the c here is between a and b.

124
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,199
So that the value of the function at c

125
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,560
is zero right because the function start

126
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,639
off negative and it end positive. So

127
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,319
there must be somewhere in between where

128
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,120
it hits zero. Right? That's the

129
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,440
intermediate value. Right?

130
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,000
But now the question is then how do we

131
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,319
make this into right? So and and it's

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,960
kind of obvious. It's sort of

133
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,800
intuitively obvious that if you take a

134
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,840
function, right? Continuous just means

135
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,639
continuous means um something like that.

136
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,520
If you were drawing the graph then and

137
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,039
you have this like piece of chalk here

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,759
then then as you're drawing the graph

139
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,720
the chalk is not allowed to leave the

140
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,599
paper, right? It can't have a function

141
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,160
like this here that sort of jumps. So go

142
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,479
like this and then you jumps like this.

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,879
That's not continuous. Right? This here

144
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,879
is not continuous.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,880
Right? So continuous function is like

146
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,839
that you have to when you draw it it's

147
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,440
like in one motion the chalk doesn't

148
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,000
leave the the blackboard. Right? And so

149
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,800
it seems obvious that there should be

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,519
some point in between where the value

151
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,519
where you're crossing this axis here.

152
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,399
But how do we make this into a rigorous

153
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,240
proof? Right? And what is the property?

154
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,850
Right? So how do we make this into a

155
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
proof?

156
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,959
[Applause]

157
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,959
So how do we

158
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,200
make this

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
intuition

160
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,399
into a proof,

161
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,160
right? And this is not just sort of a

162
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,480
semantic question. It's not just a sort

163
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,800
of crazy question.

164
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Maybe in this case it sort of seemed

165
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,600
clear but very quickly if if your

166
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,160
foundation is not totally rigorous then

167
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,040
you get into something where it seems to

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,040
be the case but it might not be the case

169
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,680
right and it's also very difficult to

170
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,839
then you know it's quickly that's where

171
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,320
you arrive and you also quickly arrive

172
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,680
to that you don't even know whether it

173
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
should be the case or not right and so

174
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,560
it's really important to kind of build

175
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,560
things up step for step where each step

176
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,760
is totally rigorous and you um right

177
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,160
because it it's it not only uh you know

178
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,320
for sure that things are right but it

179
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,800
also makes it much easier to predict

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,800
what should be true

181
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:29,040
and so in order to to understand

182
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:32,160
uh why there should be some uh c between

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,519
uh a and b where the value is zero.

184
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,240
it immediately it's the first thing the

185
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,079
first question that arises what are you

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,000
using what property do we need to make

187
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,120
this into a proof what property do we

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,079
need of the real numbers right so this

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,320
is like the first question that arise so

190
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,320
what property

191
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,959
uh are we using

192
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,600
of the real numbers,

193
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
right?

194
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,360
And so in fact, what is the real

195
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,360
numbers, right? So what are the real

196
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,360
numbers?

197
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:41,200
Um and and so the thing is that

198
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,399
in particular you what you know

199
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,200
what is square root of of two. So what

200
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,200
is square root of two?

201
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,279
Square root of two.

202
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,240
Right?

203
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:03,320
And is that a real number?

204
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,320
Is square root of two a real number.

205
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,760
Right? So those are some of the

206
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:25,120
questions that you immediately get to.

207
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,880
And so now but so the answer to what are

208
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,279
the properties that you're using of the

209
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,920
real numbers. So the answer to this

210
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:37,160
question here

211
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:41,730
is is the following. And

212
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,730
[Applause]

213
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,200
so the answer to this question is so

214
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,079
what are the property of the real

215
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:55,079
numbers that you're using?

216
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,079
So the answer to that is the following.

217
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:06,760
uh that we that the real number so r

218
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,760
is a complete

219
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,240
ordered

220
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
field

221
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,839
uh that contains

222
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
the rational numbers.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,360
the rational numbers Q and denote the

224
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,399
rational numbers by Q and the real

225
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,040
numbers by capital R.

226
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,399
So that is the to in order to make this

227
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,959
proof this this proof of the the to to

228
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,680
make this the intermediate value theorem

229
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,680
this property that if you have a

230
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,560
interval from a to b you have a

231
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,720
continuous function on that interval and

232
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,120
it start off negative and it ends

233
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,279
positive that then there is some value

234
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,839
in between where zero is achieved in

235
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,839
order to make that rigorous

236
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,639
what you're using about the real numbers

237
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,199
is that is complete ordered field that

238
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,440
contains a rising number. So we need to

239
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,440
understand what this here means right

240
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,920
and I will I will in this lecture here I

241
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,000
will not explain complete I'll do that

242
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,959
at a later lecture but we will

243
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,120
understand the rest of of of of what is

244
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,519
in what what are these properties that

245
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,160
we're using. So just first some

246
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,120
notation.

247
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,920
So first some notation

248
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,920
the natural numbers.

249
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,360
So the natural numbers.

250
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,720
So the natural numbers here

251
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:08,959
and this here is

252
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:12,920
one two three four five etc. Right? So

253
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,920
these are the natural numbers

254
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,880
uh the integers.

255
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,880
So two uh set here these are the

256
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,880
integers

257
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,800
and the integers are simply the natural

258
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,920
numbers but then it also allow them to

259
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,680
be negative and it also includes zero.

260
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:49,440
So this is 0 plus or minus1

261
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,360
plus and minus 2 plus and minus three

262
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,000
etc.

263
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,959
These are the integers

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,759
the rational numbers are then so the

265
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,759
rational numbers Q.

266
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:15,440
So these are numbers of the form m / n

267
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:20,399
where m here is an integer

268
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:24,759
and n here sorry yeah m is a integer and

269
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,759
n here is a natural number

270
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,279
that's a rational number

271
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,160
and so now what are the properties right

272
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,160
so in order so we're building up to

273
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,600
trying to understand what property of

274
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,320
the real numbers is. But let's try to

275
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,079
somehow understand a little bit better

276
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,759
what are the property that we really

277
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:52,639
have about the rational numbers.

278
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:55,680
So for rational numbers we have right so

279
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,399
we write a rational number as a quotient

280
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,360
like that right but of course there are

281
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,680
many ways that you can write a quotion

282
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,680
right so so property of the rational

283
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,680
numbers

284
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:25,360
so We write it as a quotion like this.

285
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,000
But this is not uniquely defined. Right?

286
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,520
There are you know if you take a quotion

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,760
like this you you think that this here

288
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:42,240
is equal to another quotient

289
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:44,640
right? Again, sorry. Again, m1 and m2

290
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,080
are integers

291
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:53,200
and n1 and n2 are natural numbers.

292
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,919
Two quotients are the same, right? If

293
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,480
and only if

294
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,919
right that if you multiply this over

295
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,720
here and this over there, then those

296
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:11,679
numbers are the same. So m_sub_1 *

297
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:14,720
n_sub_2 is equal to m_sub_2 * n1. Right?

298
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,919
Those two rational numbers are the same

299
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,160
if and only if those two natural numbers

300
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,480
are the same or integers, sorry,

301
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,000
integers, right? Because m is could be

302
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,440
negative. Right? So

303
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,440
right. So this is so again a rational

304
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,840
number it has a representative like this

305
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,679
but it's really kind of always you could

306
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,400
think about it as always you can write

307
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,120
this quotion right and two quotients are

308
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,200
the same if and only if this is the

309
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,520
case.

310
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,919
So this is what it means to be a

311
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,919
rational number.

312
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,840
uh but then there are some some

313
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,960
operations right if you have two

314
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:06,080
rational numbers then you can add two

315
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,480
rational numbers together right so and

316
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,320
that's really important that you have

317
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,600
some operations on the rational numbers

318
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,080
so if you take

319
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,000
this here is

320
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,200
this here is one rational number and if

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,240
you Now take another rational number

322
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,240
m_sub_2 over m_sub_2.

323
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,200
Uh then how do you add two rational

324
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,520
numbers together? Right? Well, of course

325
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,840
you know that you put it on the common

326
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,720
denominator. So this here is m_sub_1 *

327
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:51,280
n_sub_2 plus

328
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:54,240
m_sub_2 * n1 / n1 * n2. Right? This here

329
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,120
gives you this here is a integer in the

330
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,600
denominator and this is a natural number

331
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,799
in the denominator. Right? And so that's

332
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,039
a representative of a of a rational

333
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,720
number. Right? So that's an operation.

334
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,760
Now

335
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,240
in order to to really know that this is

336
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,280
all right. So the idea here is that if

337
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
you take one rational number

338
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,799
like this and you take another rational

339
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,480
number like that

340
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:30,320
then you can add them and that gives you

341
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,880
another rational number. Right? That's

342
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:38,320
that's that's this operation that we

343
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:40,400
know so well and is addition. Right?

344
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,400
In order to for this really to make

345
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,960
sense, you should check that this that

346
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,840
this that this

347
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,880
rational number you get is independent

348
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,320
on the representation. Right? If you

349
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,559
have another representation for the same

350
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,159
rational number and another

351
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,799
representation for the same rational

352
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,120
number, then when you add them, you

353
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,760
should get another representation for

354
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,440
the same natural number. rational

355
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,760
number, right? Um, okay.

356
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,200
And we'll check uh one of these things

357
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,360
in just a minute, right? The other thing

358
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,400
is

359
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,559
that um

360
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,960
right so that was one operation, right?

361
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,720
When you have the the the rational

362
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,799
number, then addition is one operation.

363
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,960
Another operation is of course

364
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,960
multiplication.

365
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
So

366
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,559
so another operation is multiplication.

367
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,869
And so

368
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,869
[Applause]

369
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,679
and so if you take one rational number

370
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,600
like this

371
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:01,440
and you take another rational number

372
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,679
like that, then if you multiply them

373
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,559
together, right? So what does it mean to

374
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,280
multiply two rational numbers together?

375
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:13,440
Well, of course you know this very well.

376
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,480
It's just multiplying the denominator.

377
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,120
So that gives you a integer and then

378
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,120
multiplying the denominator that gives

379
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,520
you a natural number. So this here is a

380
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,520
rational number.

381
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,520
Okay?

382
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,760
And then there's another thing. So this

383
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,200
is addition.

384
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,880
This was addition. This is

385
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,080
multiplication.

386
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,320
But there's another important

387
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,919
property that you have for the rational

388
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,919
number and that is an ordering.

389
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,200
Again, we're trying to understand this

390
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,280
question up there. We just trying to

391
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
understand how do we make the

392
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,480
intermediate value uh theorem? How do we

393
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,400
make this rigorous? And so we need to

394
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,240
understand what property of the real

395
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,480
numbers we we we need. And so this is

396
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,320
explained in this and we were working

397
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
towards trying to understand the

398
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,919
different concepts in this. What is a

399
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,000
field? That's what we're trying to

400
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,039
understand.

401
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,039
And so so we have addition in the

402
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,440
rational numbers. We have addition. We

403
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,360
have multiplication. But we have another

404
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,840
operation on which is an ordering. So if

405
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,280
you take a

406
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,039
If you take a a rational number here,

407
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,600
then you can say that this rational

408
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,559
number is less than another rational

409
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,960
number, right? When is it less than

410
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,440
another rational number? This is

411
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,640
equivalent. You're saying remember that

412
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,000
the that these here are natural numbers.

413
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,640
So they're positive. So that this

414
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,720
rational number is less than that just

415
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:01,760
means that m_sub_1 * n_sub_2 is less

416
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,400
than m_sub_2 * n1 right

417
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,600
here I'm using right I'm just

418
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
multiplying over here over here right

419
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,159
and I'm using of course that these

420
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,880
numbers here are positive

421
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,000
okay so this is an ordering so in the

422
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,679
rational numbers there is actually

423
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,320
ordering. Okay, so that's really

424
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,480
important also. Right. So we have these

425
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,880
two operations and then we have an

426
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,039
ordering. Okay.

427
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,840
And so here is so

428
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:37,200
right. So here is so let me just check

429
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,200
right. So I said that when we talked

430
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,520
about addition right when we talked

431
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,600
about addition here then there was

432
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,360
something really you had to check that

433
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,400
this even made any sense right and if

434
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,360
for this to make any sense means that

435
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,039
that this rational number you get from

436
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,120
adding these two is independent on how

437
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,520
you write this rational number and how

438
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,960
you write that rational number and the

439
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:09,640
same for multiplication.

440
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,640
So let us check that.

441
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,279
So

442
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,279
so this here is checking

443
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,600
that

444
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
multiplication

445
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,080
is a well- definfined

446
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
operation

447
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,520
I

448
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,520
it is independent

449
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,840
it is uh independent

450
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,919
uh of the

451
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,919
the representative

452
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:11,120
So, so we are multiplying we take this

453
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,320
rational number sorry write a little bit

454
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,440
bigger this rational number. So this is

455
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:21,919
one rational number

456
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:25,360
and we multiply it uh by we multiply

457
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,120
this rational number uh by another

458
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,440
rational number let's call it p1 comma

459
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,440
uh q1

460
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,480
and then we take another representative

461
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,520
for the same rational number and let's

462
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,200
call this m2

463
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,679
m2 and for this rational number. We take

464
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,679
another representative

465
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,480
and we want to prove that this here is

466
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,320
the same, right? This number here is the

467
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:04,679
same as that number here. Right.

468
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,679
So, how do we do that?

469
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,640
Right. So we have that this here and

470
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,559
this here is the same this two different

471
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,840
representation of the same rational

472
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:26,480
number. So we have that m1 / n1

473
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,760
is equal to m_sub_2 / n2.

474
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,600
So this just meant that remember that

475
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,000
this just meant that when you multiply

476
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,279
over here like that then you get the

477
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,799
same integers. So this here N2 plus

478
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:43,840
N_sub_2 * N1 right that's what it meant

479
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,120
that these here were the same and

480
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,320
likewise you have the two rational

481
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,799
numbers here this is one this here is

482
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,039
equal to that P2 / Q2

483
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:03,279
this just meant that when you multiply

484
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:04,480
over P1 Q2 is equal to P2

485
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,440
uh Q1

486
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,919
Right?

487
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,679
So this just meant that these that these

488
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,000
two represent the same rational number.

489
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,880
These two represent the same natural a

490
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,320
rational number. And now what we need to

491
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,399
prove is that the product here is

492
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,559
independent of these of these

493
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,520
representation.

494
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,880
So the product here

495
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,799
is so we need to prove the product of

496
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,640
the first

497
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:45,279
uh right the product this product here

498
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:48,399
this product here this is just m1 * p1

499
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,399
divided by n1

500
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,720
* q1 and we want to show this is what we

501
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,720
want to

502
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,919
that this thing here is the same if we

503
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,080
took this other representation and

504
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,720
multiply by the other reputation of

505
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:13,279
this. Right? So this is M2

506
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,039
* P2

507
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,919
M2 * Q2 that's what we want to prove

508
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,200
that those two are same.

509
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,360
And so we need to prove that. So we need

510
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,360
to show

511
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,159
that M1

512
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:39,760
P1

513
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:43,679
times this denominator here N2

514
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,159
Q2. Right? We need to prove

515
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,159
need to show

516
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,240
that this thing here is equal to N2

517
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,480
P2 N1 Q1. That's what we need to prove,

518
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,440
right?

519
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,440
But now let's let's see. So we know that

520
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,320
if we take

521
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,399
um if we take m1 right if we take

522
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,840
m_sub_1

523
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:23,679
and together with n2

524
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:28,559
right m1 together with n2 this is the

525
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:31,120
same as so this here is the same as

526
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,320
m_sub_2

527
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,840
n1 right this is what this here saying

528
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,440
Right? And it also say that if you take

529
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:44,480
P1 together with Q2, then you may as

530
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,760
well write this thing here. Right? So

531
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,360
you may as well write P2

532
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,120
Q1.

533
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,120
Right? So this thing here is equal to

534
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:59,440
that. But now you see that here you have

535
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,080
M2, here you have N1, here you have P2,

536
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,679
here you have Q1. So those two are the

537
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,320
same. Right? So this proves that this

538
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,200
operation of multiplication is well

539
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,640
defined in the rational number right and

540
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,799
similarly for addition. The reason of

541
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,440
course why I chose multiplication is

542
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,279
that it's looks a little simpler on the

543
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,039
blackboard right it's a little more

544
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,960
messy if you did addition but that's

545
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,360
really you know it's just exactly the

546
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,559
same.

547
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,960
Okay. So

548
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,120
um

549
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,720
right so now um so now and then so this

550
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,399
is also supposed to illustrate you know

551
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,559
how detail a proof is right that so you

552
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,279
know when we have a concept like this we

553
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,840
want to make sure that it really makes

554
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,080
sense right and in this case makes sense

555
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,480
that it's well defined it's independent

556
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,720
on the representation

557
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,960
and so the proof here this here would be

558
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,960
the proof.

559
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,519
Um, okay. So now, so now, so, so the

560
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,600
takeaway here at the moment is we're

561
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,039
building towards this with understanding

562
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,360
a field. We want to understand the the

563
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,840
real numbers. But the takeaway at the

564
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,200
moment is

565
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,679
that on the rational numbers, there is a

566
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,600
way of adding two rational numbers and

567
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,120
multiplying two rational numbers. And

568
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:35,360
there's also an ordering. Okay.

569
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,840
And so this leads us to to um the

570
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,840
following definition.

571
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,960
And so this is the definition of a

572
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,519
field.

573
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,519
So a field

574
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:04,159
And I will use uh f here capital f for

575
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,440
for a field

576
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,440
uh um is the following.

577
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,200
So it's a set

578
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,840
with two operations

579
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,720
and the operations we are denoting

580
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,760
suggestively by. So the two operations

581
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,640
are denoted suggestively by plus

582
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,320
and

583
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,279
and and

584
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,799
and uh and and multip like a

585
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,000
multiplication like a dot right so and

586
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,480
but these are this is just abstract

587
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,720
right so we have a set and we have these

588
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,000
two operations

589
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,880
what property do these two operation

590
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,320
need to have they each of them have five

591
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,960
properties and then there's a so that

592
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,359
means that there are 10 properties and

593
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,079
then there's 11 property that chain

594
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:18,679
those two operations together. Okay. So

595
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,679
let's start with addition. So properties

596
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,399
of addition.

597
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:34,399
So the first property is that addition

598
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,639
make any sense. So if you take a element

599
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,240
in the field and you take another

600
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:44,879
element in the field

601
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,440
then addition gives you a third element.

602
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,760
So when you add these together this is

603
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,679
just a third element in the field.

604
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
So this is the first property that it

605
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,079
really is an operation that when you

606
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,440
take two elements of the field then you

607
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:06,000
get another element in the field. So

608
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:10,400
this is one. Uh the second is

609
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,440
um that if you add two elements together

610
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,079
so x and y are in the field if you add

611
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,520
two elements together then the ordering

612
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,240
that you're adding it is is is is

613
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,880
irrelevant. So this here is the same as

614
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,880
y + x.

615
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,280
Then uh then the next one is this is

616
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,079
sometimes called a billion or

617
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,119
commutative this property here. Then

618
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,800
there's a third property uh which is

619
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,079
that if you add two elements together

620
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,599
and then you add a third element

621
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,839
to the sum of these two then this here

622
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:57,240
is the same as that you can add the last

623
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,240
two first

624
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,160
and then add the first one to the sum of

625
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,160
the other two.

626
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Okay.

627
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,320
and

628
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,320
[Applause]

629
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,320
um

630
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:26,400
right and so the fourth property is that

631
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,920
there is a what is sometimes referred to

632
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,880
as a neutral element. So there is uh

633
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,440
there exist

634
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,440
there exist

635
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,040
an element

636
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,040
uh that we denote by denoted by

637
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,720
by zero but it's just to to make it kind

638
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,000
of easier to understand that we denote

639
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,920
it by zero and it has a property having

640
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,920
the property that has a property

641
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,760
that if you take this zero element and

642
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,920
you add it to any other element

643
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,720
then it just gives you back that other

644
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,720
element. So it's kind of neutral for the

645
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,720
operation.

646
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,760
And then there's supposed to be a fifth

647
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,200
property and the fifth property is that

648
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,200
for any element

649
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,680
X there exist

650
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,839
another element

651
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,240
and again we s we write this

652
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,880
suggestively by minus X with a bracket

653
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,119
around like this.

654
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,119
So there is another element with a

655
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,119
property

656
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,760
that if you take X and you're adding

657
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,640
this other element

658
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,520
then you get zero.

659
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,440
Okay. So those are the five properties

660
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,480
that addition has to have right and then

661
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,440
multiplication have to have five

662
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,800
properties also and it's these are

663
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,440
similar to this with a little twist

664
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,680
uh and so so

665
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,040
for multiplication

666
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,040
you need to have the following

667
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,040
properties.

668
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,920
So again it's five properties. The first

669
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:53,040
one is is the similar property to the

670
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,680
property one up there. Namely that if

671
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,640
you take two elements X and Y in the

672
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,400
field

673
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,119
then

674
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,200
when you multiply them together that

675
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,359
should give you another element in the

676
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:13,520
field. Right? So that's the first. The

677
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:18,800
second one is similar to true up there

678
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:21,800
is that x * y should be the same as y *

679
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,800
x.

680
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:30,400
So again that's often referred to that

681
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:35,000
it is a billion of community.

682
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,000
The third property is

683
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,800
that it's similar to the third property

684
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,200
up there is that if you take X time Y

685
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,079
and then you multiply it by a third

686
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,000
element, then you could as well have

687
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:54,800
first multiplied the two last elements

688
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,839
and then multiply by the first element

689
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:02,400
like that.

690
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:05,119
And then the then the uh the fourth

691
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,520
property is similar to that property

692
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,240
four up there

693
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,240
is that there exist

694
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,240
an element

695
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,920
denoted by denoted suggestively

696
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,839
by one here

697
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,480
with a property that one times any

698
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,839
element x

699
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,640
just give you back that element x.

700
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,839
And then the fifth is similar except

701
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,079
there's a twist slight twist.

702
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,200
Uh

703
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,040
and so the fifth property is

704
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,040
that

705
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,680
but it's very similar to that fifth over

706
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,680
there. The fifth property is the

707
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,680
following.

708
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,359
The fifth property here is that they

709
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,359
exist that for any

710
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,480
for any

711
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,800
uh x in the field

712
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,119
except

713
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:19,720
zero. You have to disregard zero. For

714
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,720
any other element there exist

715
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,599
there exist an element

716
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,839
and again denoted by suggestively

717
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:37,480
denoted by

718
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,480
by one of x with a property

719
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:53,920
that x* * 1 /x is equal to 1. Okay. So

720
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,480
those are the five properties for um for

721
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,319
addition, five properties for

722
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,319
multiplication. And you see that they

723
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,160
are like you know the one for

724
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,960
multiplication is like a mirror of the

725
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,160
one for addition except the fifth one

726
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,319
has this that you have to to look away

727
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,760
from the zero elements. Right?

728
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:19,520
and and then there is a right and so

729
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,960
again this is this is just one is just

730
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,440
that it is an operation two is usually

731
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,160
called the billion property or commutive

732
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,680
property this is called the associative

733
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,880
property this is called it's often also

734
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,960
referred to that's a neutral element and

735
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,560
this here

736
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:46,440
um that exist this element in this case

737
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,440
minus X is sometimes called the inverse

738
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,520
uh and and likewise for for

739
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,440
multiplication and then there is again

740
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,079
an 11th property and that's a property

741
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,240
because you see that those at the moment

742
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,119
is basically no interaction between

743
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,760
these two operations. The only way that

744
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:09,200
you see some interaction but this is

745
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,319
very little is that the fifth property

746
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,480
over here refer to the neutral element

747
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,359
for addition right but they don't really

748
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,920
chain the two operations together and

749
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,160
that is the last property that is often

750
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,280
referred to as a distributive law. So

751
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,280
this is a action

752
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,960
chaining

753
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,760
uh addition

754
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,000
write like this addition

755
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,000
uh together

756
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,760
uh with multiplication.

757
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:00,480
And that is that

758
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:03,599
that if you take x and you multiply it

759
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,400
by y + c

760
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,119
is you take this sum here and then you

761
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,280
multiply by x. That is supposed to be

762
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,400
the same as where you first multiply x

763
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:21,280
with y and then you add when you

764
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:24,160
multiply x by c. So this is often called

765
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,880
the distributive law. Okay. And that's a

766
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,480
law again or action that is chaining

767
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:35,040
these two operations together.

768
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,839
Okay. So now let's try to see

769
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,640
um let's try to see. So, so let me just

770
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,200
establish just one little property of a

771
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,280
field.

772
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:50,400
And you see like that

773
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,680
when we talked about

774
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,560
when we talked about the the actions for

775
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,440
addition, right? I just said that there

776
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,520
had to exist one element that we call

777
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,520
the zero element and it had to have some

778
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,200
property. But maybe there are many

779
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,760
elements, right? And so this is the

780
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,760
first field theorem

781
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,640
for any field

782
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,119
any field I I just write it as capital

783
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:25,200
field but it's just to kind of but you

784
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,960
don't really have to uh for any field um

785
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,280
f

786
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,280
uh there exist

787
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,680
only one

788
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:36,880
one z sure z sure z sure z sure z sure z

789
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,880
sure z sure z sure z sure z sure zero

790
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,880
element

791
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:50,880
okay now let's try to prove this

792
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,520
and again you know I'm um I'm trying to

793
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,760
I mean I mean there's all kind of

794
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,520
important concept in this class but

795
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,200
there's also there's also um the thing I

796
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,760
mean another thing that is important to

797
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,280
learn and usually uh and you have to be

798
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,520
a little bit patient because it will

799
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,520
take you a little bit of time to learn

800
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,359
it. Um is how to write a mathematical

801
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,599
proof

802
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,480
and so this here just gives you just a

803
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,720
little bit of idea of it. So we need to

804
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,280
we want to prove that there exist only

805
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:28,599
one zero element. So we have so assume

806
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,599
so assume

807
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,280
that

808
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,440
01 and O2

809
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,440
are both

810
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,640
uh zero elements,

811
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,160
right? So, so this means that so this

812
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,160
means

813
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,839
that if you take 01 that is a zero

814
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,720
element just means that if you take 01

815
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:01,280
and you add anything to it right x could

816
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,000
be anything in the field then you get x

817
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,599
back right that is that 01 is a zero

818
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,599
element that O2 is a zero element just

819
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,520
mean the same thing that if you take

820
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:16,160
anything in x then you get x back

821
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:21,920
Now we want to prove that 01 is equal to

822
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:25,839
O2. So I just write 01 plus O2. But now

823
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,480
I'm just thinking about this O2 as my X.

824
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,119
So I'm adding 01

825
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,440
to this X. So I know that I'm just

826
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:39,119
getting this here back. Right? That is

827
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:42,240
because 01 is a zero element. But I

828
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:45,359
could do the same with O2 that I take

829
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,520
and the ordering I know already is is

830
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,880
irrelevant, right? Whether it's 01 plus

831
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,839
O2 plus 01, that's the same. So I can

832
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:58,400
take I can think about this 01 here as

833
00:47:53,839 --> 00:48:00,160
my X. And so I'm adding the O2 to it,

834
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,040
right? But then I know that I'm getting

835
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,400
this here back, right? So this here must

836
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:10,920
also be equal to 01, right? And so you

837
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,920
see that 01 is equal to O2.

838
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,079
And of course in the you know in the

839
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,720
notes uh in the in the notes that are

840
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,880
post things are kind of written slightly

841
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,520
more rigorous. I mean you know it's I

842
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,359
mean there's a little bit more

843
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,359
there's a little bit more meat to it.

844
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:33,440
Here I write it a little bit shorter on

845
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:36,440
the board but so so look also at the

846
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,440
notes.

847
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:43,760
Okay. So now we so so now we know what a

848
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,559
field is right. So a field again it has

849
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,280
these two operations additions and

850
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,920
multiplication. Each of those operations

851
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,839
have five property and then there's 11

852
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,920
property that chain those two operations

853
00:48:53,839 --> 00:49:02,119
together.

854
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,119
And so the examples of a fields is

855
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,000
so we already have an example.

856
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:17,000
So the rational numbers here is a field

857
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:25,880
right. It has these two operations and

858
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,880
with all the 11 properties

859
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,040
the natural numbers is not is not a

860
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,680
field

861
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:38,079
it's not a field

862
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,640
it fails even the most basic

863
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,520
I mean it fails many of the properties

864
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,400
it needs but it fails that even the zero

865
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:51,040
element is not in it right of course

866
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:55,119
it's not even a yeah it's I And it

867
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:58,559
so and the integers here

868
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:02,119
is also is not a field.

869
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,119
It's not a field

870
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:10,079
that is

871
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,240
slightly closer to being a field but

872
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,200
it's still not. And why is this not a

873
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:20,480
field? It's for multiplication. Right?

874
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:23,920
If you take two then by two if you think

875
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,400
about two then there should be right the

876
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,920
the neutral element for multiplication

877
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,880
that's a usual one right but if you take

878
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,880
say the element two then there should be

879
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,880
an element like the inverse there should

880
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,559
be an element with a property that if

881
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,960
you take two and you multiply with with

882
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,880
that element then you should get one

883
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,119
right that should be the inverse element

884
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,559
right? One over it. But this is like a

885
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,480
half, but you're missing a half in the

886
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,520
in the integers, right? So that's why

887
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,520
this is not a field.

888
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:04,800
Okay. So the next concept is so we're

889
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:07,440
again we're working our way towards

890
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,319
trying to understand what property of

891
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,960
the real numbers that we need in order

892
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:18,520
to make that the intermediate value

893
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,520
theorem. uh proof rigorous

894
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,760
and so

895
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:28,960
so so we have now we now know what a

896
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:32,319
field is next time I'll talk about

897
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:37,280
or the next few times I'll talk about uh

898
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:40,960
complete what that means but but um but

899
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:45,760
we also have this ordering so what does

900
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:51,160
it mean that a field is ordered So, so,

901
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,160
so let's start with an ordered set.

902
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:01,119
So, an ordered set. So, this is a set

903
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:04,720
is a set

904
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,720
denoted by a capital S. And it has a

905
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,160
property that whenever you have two

906
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,319
elements in the set

907
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,079
then it should either be and the

908
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:19,640
ordering by the way. So an order set

909
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,640
with an ordering

910
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,599
and I denote the ordering again

911
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,200
suggestively by this. I could have used

912
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,839
any other symbol but I'm just

913
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,880
suggestively using this symbol just to

914
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,800
kind of make it easier to remember the

915
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,680
property you know it's like this sort of

916
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:43,359
property that you know so well

917
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:48,680
so an order set

918
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:48,680
is a set with an ordering

919
00:52:52,720 --> 00:53:00,880
and again denoted by this so that if you

920
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:05,480
take any two elements in the set then

921
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,480
one of the three properties should hold.

922
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,559
The following three property should hold

923
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,520
[Applause]

924
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,520
should.

925
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:33,359
One is that uh so either x should be

926
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,720
equal to y.

927
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:41,599
Two the other possibility is that x is

928
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,760
smaller than y or three y is smaller

929
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,640
than x.

930
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,640
So basically if you have an order set

931
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,040
whenever you take two element you should

932
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,640
be able to compare these two elements.

933
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,960
Of course, these two element could be

934
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,880
the same elements, right? But if they're

935
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,319
not the same elements, then one should

936
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,920
be smaller than the other, right?

937
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:09,119
So that's the idea.

938
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:14,240
Okay. And so now uh the next concept is

939
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:18,640
uh an ordered field. And so again,

940
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:22,640
now we need so so now we have

941
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:26,280
a field and we have an ordered set. So

942
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,280
an ordered field

943
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,920
is a field.

944
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,960
that

945
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,920
is also

946
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,920
uh an ordered set

947
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,960
and then the operations from the fields

948
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,200
and the ordering they should be they

949
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,880
should speak to each other right so

950
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,040
there should be an interaction between

951
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,880
these two operations

952
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,960
uh so it has to have with the following

953
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:11,119
properties

954
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,119
with the following properties

955
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,839
that if you take

956
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:29,920
if you take if uh so it's finding two

957
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:34,079
properties that if x is less than y so

958
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,319
and you adding a uh c to both so if

959
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,400
you're adding so this here implies that

960
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:41,200
for any

961
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,880
for any

962
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:47,920
set in in the field

963
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:53,599
uh if you add the sets to both sides. So

964
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:56,319
x + set is less than y + z.

965
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,280
So you should have you should be able to

966
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:03,040
add something to both sides and it does

967
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,720
it's still less than

968
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,440
like that.

969
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,599
And the other thing is so this is this

970
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,400
here is how how do the ordering

971
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:15,839
interacts with addition and the other

972
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,760
thing is how do it act interact with

973
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:20,240
multiplication

974
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:25,440
and there the property is that if you

975
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:28,640
take a x that is positive

976
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:32,240
and y is positive

977
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,920
and y and y so you have both x and y

978
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,200
that are positive

979
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,240
Then the product of these two should

980
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,839
also be positive. Right? So then this

981
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,599
here

982
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:46,559
the product of the two should also be

983
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:50,079
positive. Right? And so this is how how

984
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,000
do the ordering interact with

985
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,400
multiplication. Right? This is how it

986
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,119
interacts with addition. This is how it

987
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,119
interacts with multiplication.

988
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,359
Okay?

989
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,359
And so now

990
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:10,720
now uh well the first thing you observe

991
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:14,280
is that again you already know an

992
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,280
example of this.

993
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,480
So um

994
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:30,920
so the rational number of Q here

995
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,920
is an order field.

996
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,359
Right? We've already seen that it is a

997
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,160
field has those 11 property. It has

998
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,240
addition multiplication has each of

999
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,440
those are fine property. It has the 11

1000
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:52,079
that chain the two together.

1001
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,319
And we also discussed the ordering. If

1002
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,160
you take two rational numbers, what does

1003
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,240
mean that one is less than the other?

1004
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,880
Right? It has the property of an

1005
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,599
ordering that you can compare any two

1006
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,160
elements, any two rational numbers that

1007
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:09,920
either they are the same or if you have

1008
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:12,920
two, one is less than the other.

1009
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,920
Um

1010
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:20,720
um and it also has this the additive

1011
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:23,520
property, right? and also the ordering

1012
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,760
interact with addition in this way and

1013
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,680
it interacts with multiplication in this

1014
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:33,359
way. Okay. So the rational number is

1015
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:37,040
indeed an ordered field. Okay.

1016
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:38,960
Now let me just establish one last

1017
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:43,560
property.

1018
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:47,839
Uh and that is that um if I take

1019
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:49,680
[Applause]

1020
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:52,680
so let me try to prove a little theorem

1021
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,680
here.

1022
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,920
Um so so

1023
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,720
here's the theorem

1024
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,960
that so we have uh so f here is supposed

1025
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:18,119
to be an ordered

1026
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,119
uh field.

1027
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,760
Uh and then we have that x here is less

1028
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,920
than y.

1029
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:33,760
uh and

1030
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:37,280
and uh and and C here is is positive.

1031
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:40,000
Fine. So I I assume I have this and now

1032
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:42,640
I want to show that then I claim that

1033
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:47,599
from these properties uh that order

1034
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:52,640
field have I get automatically then uh X

1035
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:55,760
* C is less than Y * C. So I claim I get

1036
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,559
the this property here right that you

1037
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:04,200
know from the these properties over

1038
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:04,200
here. Okay. So let's try to prove that.

1039
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:10,840
[Applause]

1040
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:27,640
So what I want to do is I want to so so

1041
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,640
we want to show

1042
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:38,400
that x * set is less than y * z.

1043
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,480
This is what we want to show.

1044
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:47,079
Now to say this here, right? This here

1045
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,079
is equivalent. This is equivalent

1046
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,720
to showing

1047
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:04,640
that right. So if you take this you

1048
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:10,319
could because this here if you if you

1049
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:14,079
take if you add minus y * set sorry if

1050
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:15,760
you add sorry if you take this thing

1051
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,280
here

1052
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:23,119
and to both sides so you take x + time

1053
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:26,880
set and then you plus

1054
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:30,960
- x * set

1055
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,440
then this here is the same as by this

1056
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,680
here that to say that this is less than

1057
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,920
that is equivalent to saying that this

1058
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,920
thing here

1059
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,760
right why is that equivalent but this is

1060
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:50,960
this this law here that is chaining the

1061
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:56,240
ordering together with addition right

1062
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:59,359
and this here this element here is right

1063
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:03,319
this is just the the inverse element of

1064
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,319
this product here.

1065
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:11,440
But now you see that these two things

1066
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:14,440
together that just gives you zero,

1067
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,440
right?

1068
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,680
This thing here,

1069
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:28,559
this thing here is this here is the same

1070
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:31,760
as um as x. Okay. So, we need to maybe

1071
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:34,319
we need to show this, but this here is

1072
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:43,200
not hard to believe that this this here

1073
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:46,319
is the same as uh y * set minus uh x *

1074
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:49,920
set. So, this here is now you can factor

1075
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:53,040
out. So, this is this law, the 11th law

1076
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:57,200
that allow you to factor this one out.

1077
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:59,839
So this is the same as y - x

1078
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:04,440
* 7, right? This was this distributive

1079
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,440
law. That was the 11th law.

1080
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:12,640
But now you see that because y was

1081
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,559
bigger than x, right? Since

1082
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,440
y here

1083
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,400
was bigger than x, this here was

1084
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,400
equivalent to saying that this is

1085
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,920
equivalent to saying that y is bigger

1086
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:29,119
than x, right? If you subtract

1087
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:32,240
um x on both sides, this is equivalent

1088
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:36,559
to saying that y - x is bigger than

1089
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:40,799
zero. Right? This is again using the

1090
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:44,240
first action over here, right?

1091
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:47,760
And so you see that now we have that. So

1092
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:50,559
we want to prove we want to prove that

1093
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,559
this thing here right we this here is

1094
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,640
all equivalent to proving that this

1095
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,640
thing here is bigger than zero right the

1096
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,720
claim up there is equivalent to proving

1097
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:04,480
that this thing here is bigger than

1098
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:07,280
zero. Right? But the difference here

1099
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,599
this difference here is positive. This

1100
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,640
is assumed to be positive.

1101
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:15,119
The second law that is chaining the

1102
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,280
ordering together with multiplication

1103
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,280
say that if you have something positive

1104
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,640
and you multiply by something positive,

1105
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,920
you're getting something positive,

1106
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:26,640
right? And so, so in order to prove this

1107
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:30,079
here, it was the same as proving that

1108
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:33,440
this thing here is actually positive and

1109
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:36,760
we have now just reduced it to this

1110
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,760
second action.

1111
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,240
Is is that clear?

1112
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,599
Okay, that's really so we go just a

1113
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,240
little bit easy here in the first

1114
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,799
lecture. This is this is what I have for

1115
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,359
the first lecture, but there's a bunch

1116
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:56,319
of different concepts.

1117
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:58,480
Uh and again,

1118
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:01,599
um feel free of course to ask any

1119
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,440
questions uh on the class. Um I

1120
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,280
typically just linger around for a few

1121
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,160
minutes afterwards if anybody have any

1122
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,799
questions after the class and we will

1123
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:14,559
also have office hours. I'm just waiting

1124
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:20,240
for the assignment for of the TAs. So

1125
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:23,680
that will be put all on online right and

1126
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,839
um yeah okay let me know how it goes but

1127
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:28,880
and one more thing is that this again

1128
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:31,119
this I mentioned before but so my

1129
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,520
experience is that it takes people a

1130
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,160
little bit of time to get a hang of this

1131
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:39,839
with writing proofs so don't be

1132
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:43,520
discouraged you know you know a few

1133
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:45,760
weeks or months into the class things

1134
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,079
will really turn around and and it will

1135
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,160
all make sense and and then it will be

1136
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:53,160
more fun also.

1137
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,160
Okay.
