1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,279
hi uh I'm John Williams I'm professor of

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,680
information Engineering in the

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:09,120
Department of Civil environmental

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,040
engineering at

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,359
MIT and my background is basically in

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,680
physics that uh I grew up in the UK I'm

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:23,480
from Wales which is um basically steel

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,560
and Mining so uh I ended up in Oxford

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,720
University played rugby uh there for

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,880
Oxford so I got Oxford blue they call it

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,200
and uh we happened to beat the springbox

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,960
who were the world champions at the

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,640
moment in rugby uh but that was a long

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,320
time ago and so my journey went through

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,640
uh

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,920
UCLA uh where I studied physics and

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,480
basically got fascinated with how we

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,879
could simulate

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,600
physics and I ended up going back to uh

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,120
Wales and did a PhD in Swansea

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
University uh and that was the place

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,920
where they invented the finite element

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,519
method

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,720
uh a guy called zenovich Professor

25
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,640
zenovich there was the world kind of

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,799
renowned in fite elements and so I

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,960
became embroiled if you like and

28
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,600
fascinated by

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:19,320
simulation and after the PHD uh I went

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,200
into industry for eight years and did

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,720
two startups um one in Colorado and we

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,720
basically were

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,280
simulating the oil rigs up in the Arctic

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,280
so I spent some time in the Arctic um

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,439
which is a place where the one thing you

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
want to do is get out of there it's

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,200
great for about 3 days and then it

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,280
becomes pretty pretty hellish um so I

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,040
spent time on offshore rigs there uh and

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,520
we were simulating in our company the

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,600
impact of ice on offshore Rigs and the

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,320
big thing about ice mechanics is that

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,520
it's not continuous that you've got

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,840
basically most of mechanics is based on

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,680
this Continuum Theory and the

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,880
assumptions of Continuum Theory don't

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,000
hold for ice that you've got it

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,760
fracturing you've got pieces of ice and

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,480
the key problem with the offshore rigs

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,200
was that the ice would ride up on the

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:23,959
sides and possibly take the deck off um

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,560
the ice was about 13 ft thick so these

53
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,680
are not small pieces of ice you know

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,000
this is the the height of a room um and

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,200
when they hit you shake the whole rig um

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,560
my first night on the rig I was really

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,959
scared it was shaking uh it was like a

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,400
leaf um but the uh structors they've

59
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,519
done a pretty good job I guess of

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,280
Designing them because they survived um

61
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,879
but that's how I became embroiled in or

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,720
fascinated by non-continuum mechanics so

63
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,840
this is where you've got pieces like you

64
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:04,040
might have a soil um or sand or powders

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,799
so drugs for example um and in the

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,840
company we invented something called the

67
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:12,319
discrete element method um which is

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,000
basically lots of particles and the

69
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,760
trick is how to figure out how they

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,760
interact so computationally it's quite

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,200
expensive um but we made some uh we

72
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,040
developed a a commercial code actually

73
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,400
called SE ice that was uh sold to the

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,120
oil companies and so after that um we

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,760
sold the company um didn't make a lot of

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,640
money had lots of shares that we could

77
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,720
paper walls with but eventually uh they

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,040
they came good um but then I applied to

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,680
MIT for a job in MIT and I became a

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,599
research scientist here so that's how I

81
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,599
ended up in MIT that's the short story
