00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,000
thank you um so my name is JJ and I'm

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,240
the co-founder and chief scientist of

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,400
tupi a startup company span out from my

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,000
group at MIT focusing on Innovative

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,040
optic

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Solutions so we all live in an

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,400
information era today and we are

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,000
receiving ever increasing amount of

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,080
information they actually being captured

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,439
in processed using light with the

11
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,720
exponential growth of optical

12
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,599
information existing optic systems are

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,519
getting increasingly large in size and

14
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,960
more complex this has become a

15
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,039
showstopper for many

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,559
applications if you look at Optical

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,000
system it really hadn't changed that

18
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,000
much over the past few decades on one

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
hand you have glass lenses that offer

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,120
high performance but require grinding

21
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,600
and polishing fabrication they are

22
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,960
costly and not scalable on the other

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,079
hand you also have plastic lenses which

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,879
can be fabricated by Ming at very low

25
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,800
cost but suffer from performance and

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,320
reliability concerns on top of that an

27
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,039
optical system typically requires

28
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,359
stacking several of these lenses

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,480
together piece by piece with careful

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,680
alignment resulting in systems with

31
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,439
increased size cost and

32
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,680
complexity T Pi has developed metal plus

33
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,720
Optics to solve this challenge our

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,439
approach uses semiconductor fabrication

35
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,360
and packaging technologies that have

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
been matured in the IC industry to

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,960
transform Optics unlike traditional

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,479
lenses that rely on curved surfaces to

39
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,759
bend light uh we fabricate tiny little

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,280
structures or Optical inners on a flat

41
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,799
wafer and then use them to control light

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,640
propagation Direction precisely as a

43
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,000
result they can be produced at high

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,920
volume with low cost leveraging standard

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,280
semiconductor waer fabrication

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,680
Technologies moreover when it comes to

47
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,200
assembly we can stack and B multiple

48
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,640
Wafers each of them containing array of

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,280
this flat lenses and precisely align

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,680
them with lithographic accuracy in the

51
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,719
end the wafer stack is then singulated

52
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,040
into thousands of individual packaged

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,079
lens modules each with the form Vector

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,320
of a small chip in this way we can

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,479
leverage Industries than their

56
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,920
semiconductor packaging technology to

57
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,719
realize large scale parallel integration

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,479
of Optics will significantly enhance

59
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,560
throughput and

60
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,119
performance so here is an use case of

61
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,000
our technology so driver monitoring

62
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,920
systems or DMS are basically small

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,560
cameras install vehicles to ensure that

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
drivers are not getting distracted while

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,239
driving and our technology enables using

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
a single component flare Optics to

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,519
replace traditional stacked glass and

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,879
polymer lenses this significantly

69
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,720
improves the thermal and mechanical rugg

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,720
which is critical to compliance with

71
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,000
Automotive regulations

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
in addition our Optics also offers enhan

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,680
Optical resolution that improves

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,159
detection accuracy and reduces Force

75
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,959
alarms we have already delivered mass

76
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,800
produced Optics to Leading tier one and

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,760
tier 2 suppliers in the automotive

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,360
industry and receive excellent feedback

79
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,800
from our

80
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,680
customers a second use case example of

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,599
our Optics is in Optical sensors for

82
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,480
augmented reality and virtual reality

83
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,000
systems uh state of the rvr modules

84
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,840
contain anywhere from 15 to 20 Optical

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
sensors to perform functions such as

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,840
facial recognition eye tracking hand

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,920
tracking 3D sing and so on when using

88
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,120
traditional Optics the size and way

89
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,959
quickly add up using our technology we

90
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,680
offer sensor modules that are far more

91
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,040
compact lightweight and can be

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,440
seamlessly integrated with arvr headsets

93
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,120
at the same time our Optics also offers

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,239
high resolution and a large field to

95
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,560
view measuring that of human preferral

96
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,720
Vision which helps to render immersive

97
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,360
user experience that other Technologies

98
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,080
can hardly match the performance of our

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,480
sensor modules has already been tested

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,720
and validated by Leading OEM vendors and

101
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,439
we are now working towards mass

102
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,599
production of this

103
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,640
product so in summary what we are

104
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,599
offering here is a platform technology

105
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,680
that can Empower applications where high

106
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,640
performance Compact and lightway Optical

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,400
systems are needed we are therefore

108
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,560
eagerly looking for partners in consumer

109
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,519
electronics Automotive robotics Medical

110
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,760
Imaging and Beyond to explore this

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,200
exciting technology thank you for your

112
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,799
attention thank you very much um can you

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,760
tell us a little more about how the

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,840
Optics are mass produced since you

115
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,000
touched on that and at what

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,439
scale uh sure so we uh we actually have

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,599
a f partners that can allow us to

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,759
actually produce this Optics all 300 mm

119
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,199
stand the W for technology um so uh this

120
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,080
is really compatible with

121
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,720
state-of-the-art semiconductor mass

122
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,280
production okay and um tell us a little

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,759
more about uavs is there an

124
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,960
application oh oh yeah that's a great

125
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,800
question so I think that's a UAV and

126
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,919
Robotics are generally sectors we really

127
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,440
sort of want to look into we got quite a

128
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,960
bit of tractions in those uh areas uh

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,479
essentially what we're offering here is

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,160
sort of a Machine Vision platform

131
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,560
Hardware platform uh that's miniaturized

132
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,240
lightweight and also high performance uh

133
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,840
so we foresee there that potentially

134
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,800
many application in this areas here for

135
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,039
example for UAV specifically like

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,160
lightweight cameras for surveying the

137
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,039
surrounding environment for collision

138
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,759
avoidance um and uh just for all of

139
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,400
other kind of essentially sing

140
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,080
application like depth detection as well

141
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,080
so uh yeah if there are any interest

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,520
from the audience in this areas I will

143
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
of course be more than happy to discuss

144
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
in more detail thank you Professor

145
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
thanks
