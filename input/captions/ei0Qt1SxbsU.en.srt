Associative learning is a powerful

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,200
example of kind of learning and the best

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,359
understood form of associative learning

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,519
is classical conditioning sometimes

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,960
called Pavlovian conditioning. Pavlov

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
was awarded the Nobel Prize in

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,360
physiology in 1904 for discoveries about

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
the digestive system which he studied in

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,199
dogs. Pavlov noticed that the salivation

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,439
could be triggered not only by the food

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,119
in the dog's mouth but also by other

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,960
stimula that were associated with the

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
food. In this case, the unconditioned

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,820
stimulus is the food. The unconditioned

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
response is the salivation in the

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,800
[music] dog. A neutral meaningless

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,520
stimulus is presented just before the

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,280
food. The tone then becomes the

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
conditioned stimulus. But if a tone is

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,160
presented multiple times just before the

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,480
food is given, the dog salivates to the

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,399
tone even before the food arrives.

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,239
Indeed, the dog salivates to the tone by

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,000
itself, having learned by classical

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
conditioning the association between the

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,160
tone and the food. This is now the

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,079
conditioned response.
