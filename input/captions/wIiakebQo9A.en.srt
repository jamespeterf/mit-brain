1
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,680
Thank you for coming to the very last

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,080
session and our moderator for this

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,800
session is Nick Fry.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
>> Hi, thanks everybody. So, uh, just

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
gather in and we'll get into some case

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
studies next. Uh, the first speaker is

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,880
going to be Carrie Smith joining us

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,800
remotely. I believe we're going to have

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,440
his video up. Okay. Uh, so Carrie Smith

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,640
is pretty well known in the industry.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,520
He's an AE fellow. Uh, and he's had

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,079
about 30 years in ground source and, uh,

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,640
subsurface and almost another 30 years

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,600
before that doing other things. Uh then

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,120
we'll have uh Mark Metzner uh who you'd

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,799
heard from earlier and Jay Egg and Susan

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,600
Merkott to follow. So uh if we can ceue

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,159
up Carrie's video.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,720
>> Hello, my name is Carrie Smith. I hope

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,799
you're enjoying the conference. Uh thank

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,560
you for letting me present my portion

22
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,960
the about ATL systems. My presentation

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
will give you an overview of one pipe

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,040
ATLs.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,119
Depending on uh how you classify

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,159
multi-building projects, we have between

27
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,079
20 and and 30 ambient temperature

28
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,720
systems operating at at this time. Uh

29
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,000
our first system was started in 2002 in

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,400
SEU Springs, Colorado. Other projects

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,520
include housing projects, a 40 acre

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,119
heavy equipment dealer service center, a

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,600
see a NASA track, seven school campuses,

34
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,399
and of course uh additional uh

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,399
university campuses like Colorado

36
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,399
University and Weber State University.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,239
I'd like to uh describe what uh these

38
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,399
the configuration of these uh uh ATLs

39
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
and stuff. First uh we have a

40
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,840
configuration that basically is a hair

41
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,959
pin. two pipes going up and down uh the

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,640
street uh which uh connected two

43
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,879
connected pipes going up and down the

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,120
street which are connected primary

45
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,239
secondarily to these loads sync sources

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,440
uh and buildings. The second would be

47
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,280
the perimeter or runaround system which

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,000
basically goes around the block or

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,599
around the campus. These two loops can

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,400
be uh two configurations can be combined

51
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,080
together to form a multi-ist uh

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,160
multi-asset uh uh system where we have a

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,599
central loop that basically connects

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,920
them. Uh and then we have submicro

55
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,760
district coming off that central loop.

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,959
We could also connect directly to

57
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,000
another central loop system. Uh

58
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,080
theoretically these are quite expandable

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
uh over a large area.

60
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,480
You know, nothing's more efficient than

61
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,920
off. Uh, an ATL uses an independently

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,159
large diameter HTP pipe

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,680
uh attached that uh that uh pipe or or

64
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,720
hydraulically separated independent surf

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,680
circuits serving buildings or system

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,720
assets.

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Uh these assets may be but are not

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,400
limited to really uh graywater and

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,640
blackwater systems

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,920
closed loop and phase change materials.

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,680
Uh that's for storage or sync source uh

72
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,040
use solar thermal systems or PVT energy

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,560
for energy addition or rejection.

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,959
um open loop sources or sinks, high to

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,720
mid temperature geothermal resources,

76
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,439
CHP waste and conventional uh boilers

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,360
and cooling towers for emergencies or

78
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,280
peak loading.

79
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,400
This system uses heat pumps and

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,040
diversity of loads to heat and cool.

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Bore hole and phase change storage is

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,759
dinural for load shifting or time of day

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,479
power reduction or or seasonal for

84
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,000
heating and cooling. All sequences are

85
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,160
birectional

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
central loop to building or building to

87
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,919
central loop.

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,240
Uh to give you an example of the control

89
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,639
of these systems, we have a building up

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,800
here that's uh running between 55 and

91
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,160
85. If it gets out of range, uh what

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,280
happens is uh it turns the central loop

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,360
pump on and goes to the central loop. Of

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,199
course, we started with the uh first

95
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
thing we had this central loop is

96
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,280
idling. So, consequently, other

97
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,479
buildings and assets are available to

98
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,560
this building. Finally, uh if uh the

99
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,800
central loop and the buildings that are

100
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
on it can satisfy the load, that's

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,199
diversity.

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,400
uh then uh we will go to green systems

103
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,000
or like uh loop fields and PV and so

104
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,479
forth. uh when the temperature is under

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,160
50 or over 85.

106
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,919
And finally when uh the system

107
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,039
uh gets above its uh set capacity and is

108
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,160
no longer able to uh uh to maintain this

109
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,479
50 to85 and it has all the green assets

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,680
on will go to boiler cooling towers uh

111
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:47,360
the for additional energy or to reject

112
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:51,360
basically under 40° or over 95 degrees.

113
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,880
This is a a uh picture of the front end

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,000
system of Colorado Mesa University. Uh

115
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,880
it uh the central loop flash fluids

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,520
building the heat pump systems. We have

117
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
about 3 and 12 miles of 18in central

118
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,919
loop pipeline in the five micro

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,919
districts. We have currently 19

120
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:18,639
buildings uh on the system itself and uh

121
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,919
13 1.3 million square ft. Uh these five

122
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,759
five micro distances are interconnected

123
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,759
and they can uh be operated

124
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,759
independently or as one system.

125
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,720
Let me see. There are over uh 250 van

126
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,360
gallons of transport fluid in the system

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,800
and there are distributed assets around

128
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,600
campus. This system uses loop fields,

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,560
irrigation water and some potable water

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,479
at this time. Uh except for a small

131
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,360
number of hours, we have not fired the

132
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,639
boilers to maintain temperature in the

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,600
system since 2012.

134
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,160
So what we've got uh here we've got loop

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,919
fields. This is district number one.

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
We've got loop fields. We've got a

137
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,039
pumping station. This is a main pumping

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,360
station uh for the central loop. It's

139
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,680
sized to uh to handle about 4,000 tons.

140
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,160
And south district 2 is down here. It's

141
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,199
a set of dorms is mostly heating. Of

142
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,440
course, it's isolated primary secondary.

143
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,800
Uh district three is the Maverick

144
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,840
Center. Uh in the center here, we have

145
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,360
mixing valves and so forth. So we can

146
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,520
direct and redirect uh the fluid and uh

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,160
uh throughout any of the micro

148
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,319
districts. Down here we have a a

149
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,520
classroom building dorm complex when we

150
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,360
have a second uh pumping station. These

151
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,360
pump two pumping stations by the way um

152
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,039
when they're used together are in a kind

153
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,599
of a

154
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,280
parallel series configuration.

155
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,000
And you know, most of the time uh uh we

156
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,479
only used one or two pumps to start

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,400
with. Uh as you might be able to see,

158
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,039
it's kind of small here. This estimate

159
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,720
right now, the central loop temperature

160
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,599
is 82 degrees. And if you notice, we

161
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,599
have none of the assets on. This is

162
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:20,160
purely run on uh uh building diversity

163
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:22,479
at this time. So, you know, uh it's uh

164
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,440
oh, oops. you know, we do have, by the

165
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:30,319
way, several buildings on at the uh at

166
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,800
the same time. So, uh,

167
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
as we go through this, um, we're

168
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
currently planning on this campus

169
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,240
another 1.3 million square foot

170
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:46,440
addition, which is going to be a sixth,

171
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,440
uh, uh, and probably seventh micro loop.

172
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
This is kind of a nice cartoon. What it

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
does is tell you a little bit about uh

174
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,680
gives you a little broader perspective

175
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,760
of what uh we have buildings on the

176
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,080
loop. Uh they can be commercial,

177
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,080
residential or industrial. They're

178
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,160
cooling dominant or heating dominant. It

179
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,760
doesn't matter. They could be balanced.

180
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,720
It just depends. Uh then on top of that

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,480
we have uh a system we're able to build

182
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,160
solar PVT uh do heat exchange panels so

183
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,120
forth. Uh we can uh use air source uh

184
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,480
pumps built into made as multissource

185
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,200
heat pumps which basically either uh use

186
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
uh air as a source or water as source

187
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,519
and of course ground source heat pumps.

188
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,240
We may have chillers on the loop. We may

189
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,399
have wastewater heat recovery and heat

190
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,160
heat exchangers or we may have

191
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,959
industrial us industrial waste and of

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,519
course we have ground heat exchangers,

193
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,000
thermal storage and water source heat

194
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,200
changers exchangers.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,040
Uh all of the systems can be interfaced

196
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,880
with the electrical uh grid and uh and

197
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,000
also in PVT uh panels and so forth. But

198
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,240
uh what we do is we operate the loop in

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,120
such a way that we can uh uh shift loads

200
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,760
and and or take care of take advantage

201
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,959
of time of day rates and and so forth.

202
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,560
Uh and then also on top of that, you

203
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,240
know, we might be turn around have

204
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,200
another source of electricity, river

205
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,959
run, wind, whatever have you.

206
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,399
And finally, you know, we can go with uh

207
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,560
additions like conventional CHP, cooling

208
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,000
towers and of course boilers for

209
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,519
emergency. Uh the interesting thing is

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,600
uh we can attach micro uh other micro

211
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,480
grids to the loop. So consider that to

212
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:52,000
be opponent. This system is emissions

213
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,480
free uh uh and uh uses electrical power

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,680
and in some cases we're starting to

215
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,519
interface with the telecon uh with with

216
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,760
grid enabled monitoring automated uh uh

217
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,320
uh sequences above the general

218
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,200
management system and monitoring and

219
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,240
intelligent control. uh for example

220
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,360
mapping the uh the flow of people back

221
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,720
and forth across campuses uh in and out

222
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:23,519
of city buildings and so forth.

223
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,640
So that concludes my uh presentation. Uh

224
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,640
I hope you enjoyed it and if you've got

225
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:36,860
any questions, please submit them.

226
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:36,860
[Applause]
