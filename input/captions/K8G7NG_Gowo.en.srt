1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,240
from the MIT energy initiative this is

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,799
what if it works a podcast looking at

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,160
the energy solutions for climate change

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,360
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob Stoner and

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,200
this is what if it

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,199
[Music]

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,080
works we're going to talk in a few

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,119
minutes about some cuttingedge ways to

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,840
take carbon out of our world well why

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,800
would you want to do that carbon dioxide

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,960
of course is a powerful greenhouse gas

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800
that contributes to climate change in

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,879
fact its levels in the atmosphere have

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,800
been increased nearly 50% just since the

15
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:38,280
1950s the Earth does have biological

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,600
systems that can remove carbon but they

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,600
cannot keep up with the sheer scale of

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,879
the stuff that is being dumped into the

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,480
atmosphere from Industrial Systems from

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,320
our various modes of transportation and

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,760
on it goes so what ideas do scientists

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,640
and Engineers have for removing it we

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,199
will get to that but first to get a

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,600
sense of where this whole line of

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,399
thinking got started you got to go back

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,399
at least to the mid

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,680
1980s in 1985 an incredibly well-known

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,439
scientist a star in the general public

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,479
named Carl Sean testified before

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
Congress we're very pleased that you

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,479
would take the time out of

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,920
your schedule to come to a place like

33
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,479
Washington where everything seems to be

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,320
living in today and not in tomorrow to

35
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,680
share with us your particular view of

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,040
how our past and our present uh May well

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,960
affect our future Carl thank you thank

38
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,680
you very much Sean was an astronomer at

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,720
Cornell who had narrated a big series on

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,119
TV called Cosmos and he showed up in DC

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,119
in 1985 to testify about climate change

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,560
which was just starting to get on more

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,280
and more people's

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,479
Radars the uh Power of uh human beings

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,320
to affect and uh control and change the

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,439
environment is growing as our technology

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,560
grows and uh at present time we clearly

48
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,680
have reached the stage where we are

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,200
capable both uh intentionally and

50
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,440
inadvertently to make significant

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,760
changes in the global climate and in the

52
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:19,160
global ecosystem a few years later in

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,400
1988 NASA scientist James Hansen would

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,879
also warn Congress about the fact that

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,480
the climate was changing and that was

56
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,319
right about the time that our guest

57
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,840
today Howard Herzog arrived at MIT the

58
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:35,160
first summer I was here back in 1989 I I

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,319
came here to work on a variety of uh

60
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,400
energy projects but the first Sumer I

61
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,159
was here uh there was a researcher here

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,959
from Japan actually doing nuclear

63
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,599
research but some of his colleagues back

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,959
in Japan asked him a question can you

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,800
capture carbon dioxide emissions coming

66
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,280
out of a power plant Howard is an

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,680
engineer a senior research engineer here

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,599
at MIT he has now written a book called

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,560
carbon capture he's the co-author of an

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,360
upcoming book on carbon removal and this

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,080
struck him as a very interesting

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,159
question can you capture CO2 emissions

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,120
coming out of a power plant three of us

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,680
formed a team and issued a report and

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,280
said yes it is feasible cost a little

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,680
money but uh you can do it and we

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,239
published and we were one of the first

78
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,480
people to publish in this area there

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,560
were a few other groups publishing and

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,599
that field eventually became known as

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,599
carbon dioxide capture and storage or

82
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,680
CCS for short but that first project led

83
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,319
to another project at had a big research

84
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,000
needs assessment for the Department of

85
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,000
energy in 1992 with some co-authors here

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,239
at the uh back then it was called the

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,519
energy lab and that just kept going

88
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,280
after about 10 years it was the major

89
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,239
part of my uh research portfolio and has

90
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,720
remained that way for the past 25 years

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,159
or so during that time hoe has seen the

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,120
interest in climate change grow we

93
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,840
organized a big Symposium called Energy

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,360
and environment in the 21st century so

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,439
was back in 1990 and our big keynote

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,560
speaker was El Gore and he was a Senator

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
and all I remember him talking about was

98
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,840
this trip underneath the arctic ice in a

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,320
submarine but he has also seen interest

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,320
in climate change Splinter back then it

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,199
was a bipartisan issue it was the first

102
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,040
George Bush that was president when the

103
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,840
framer convention was to be ratified

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,240
that came out the Rio back in 1994 he

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,240
signed it I forget it was overwhelm prly

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,880
approved by the Senate so it wasn't a

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,400
political issue back then it became that

108
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,160
over the

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,199
years I can't pinpoint anything but I

110
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:48,280
think all of our politics has become

111
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,919
more polarized and uh this was just part

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,280
of the polarization uh which is uh too

113
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,600
bad because you know it affects

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,039
everybody you know red States blue

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,320
States uh it's not something that's easy

116
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:04,360
to solve unless you have everybody on

117
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,560
board to really have good climate policy

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,840
it really has to be bipartisan and

119
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
bought in by a majority of the people

120
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,039
and

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,560
unfortunately that's not where we're at

122
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:17,120
today we're going to talk about pulling

123
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,360
carbon out of the atmosphere but to know

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,560
whether that makes any sense you really

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
have to think about how much it costs to

126
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,720
both put carbon into the atmosphere and

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,080
to pull it out fossil fuels how he says

128
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,600
are a pretty great energy source and if

129
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,639
you don't acknowledge the fact that

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,080
they've got a downside by putting a

131
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,759
price on them people will turn to them

132
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,319
which is logical Europe has put a price

133
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,280
on carbon which can go up to $100 per

134
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,400
ton of CO2 how he says but of course

135
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,400
people are resistant to pay that kind of

136
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,080
tax it's going to cost more to reduce

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,080
our carbon emissions but the real

138
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,160
question is if we don't reduce our

139
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,280
carbon emissions what's the cost there

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,240
and that cost can be high high but still

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,400
there's a lot of interest in removing

142
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,599
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere so

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,960
what do the range of options look like

144
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,919
once the carbon's already out there

145
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,520
howwi we laid it out for us there's two

146
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,360
ways to get Co2 out of the air okay one

147
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,599
is biological and that's through

148
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,160
photosynthesis plants do this all the

149
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,000
time they record the CO2 level in the

150
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,919
atmosphere at the monolo observatory if

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,199
you look at that it's not a straight

152
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,919
line a squid goes going up and down in

153
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
the uh spring all of a sudden the plants

154
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,759
come to life and they suck up a lot of

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,960
the carbon dioxide and when they die in

156
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,360
the fall it goes back up and you can

157
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,479
actually see it in the measurements in

158
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,319
the atmosphere plants I saw a

159
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,720
visualization of this I have to say at

160
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,840
the MIT media lab Rachel Connelly who

161
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,199
works on NASA stuff it was amazing

162
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,680
during the Spring and the summer there's

163
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,800
so much less carbon dioxide in the air

164
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,840
right than in the winter when there just

165
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,160
so many few leaves to suck it up yeah

166
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,759
and for people who think well there's a

167
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,560
southern hemisphere too but most of the

168
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,479
lands in the northern hemisphere that's

169
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
what really controls that and the

170
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,240
measurements are being made in the

171
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,120
northern hemisphere so you have

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,360
photosynthesis and the other is

173
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,280
chemically and the way you do a

174
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,879
chemically is you do it with what I call

175
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,680
Alkali and Alkali just means it's a

176
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,280
chemical that's basic and CO2 is an acid

177
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,000
so think of when you're a kid and you

178
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,280
did the volcanoes with the baking soda

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,560
and vinegar vinegar is an acid baking

180
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,919
soda is a base and they react together

181
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
same with Alkali and carbon dioxide in

182
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,280
the atmosphere the problem is we don't

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
have Alkali rying around why don't we

184
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,840
have Alkali rying around because if it

185
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,000
was the CO2 in the atmosphere would

186
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,639
react with it and neutralize it so we

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,280
have to create and that costs money and

188
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,159
there's several ways to create this

189
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,240
Alkali and so what you have are things

190
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,759
like direct air capture which uses

191
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,800
absorbent talk about things like enhanc

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,560
weathering people talk about liming the

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,120
ocean lime is a alkaline material I've

194
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,400
heard of weather forecasting what Isa

195
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,319
sorry in enhanced Rock weathering so the

196
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,199
way that nature takes seal to out of the

197
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,639
atmosphere is by reacting with alkaline

198
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,240
rocks and these a lot of these alkaline

199
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,680
rocks are silicate type rocks and the

200
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,479
problem is the time scale for this is

201
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,479
100 thousands of years so that's slow so

202
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,680
there's always been a slow removal of Co

203
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,599
to into rocks over time but they want to

204
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,399
enhance that they want to get this thing

205
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,360
from taking 100,000 years to taking days

206
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,039
pressing fast forward on nature if I

207
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,920
could take this rock and really crush it

208
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,240
up so it's fine so a lot more sees the

209
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,279
air it will speed up the reaction but

210
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,279
the problem is to crush it up that fine

211
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,839
it takes a lot of uh energy whatever we

212
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,600
look at those ways take energy so so

213
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,320
those are are are the um things now now

214
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,160
when we go back to photosynthesis

215
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,959
there's two ways to to think about it

216
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,079
one is let's just plant a tree and leave

217
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,240
it there and so there's a concept called

218
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,680
stocks and flows stocks means how much

219
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,320
you have in a given Place flows is the

220
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,440
flow going between so what we're doing

221
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,560
with climate change is we have flows of

222
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,920
CO2 in the atmosphere primarily from our

223
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,600
our fossil fuel use and that increases

224
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,320
the stock of CO2 in the atmosphere some

225
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,880
of that will get also absorbed in in the

226
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,040
trees and vegetation and the ocean but

227
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,880
about half of it stays up in the

228
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,519
atmosphere so if we stop emitting CO2

229
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,160
today we stop the flow but the stock is

230
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,000
still up there you know that's the issue

231
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,120
that's why it lasts a long time and it's

232
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,480
the stock that's in the atmosphere that

233
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,360
determines how severe climate change is

234
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,880
going to be how how the temperature rise

235
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,920
and the other impacts so one thing we

236
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,360
can do is we can just plant more trees

237
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,160
we can figure out how to get more trees

238
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,760
or more stocks of carbon on a certain

239
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,680
area actually the soils contain about

240
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,320
twice as much carbon as the trees and

241
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,800
vegetation so if we want to get into

242
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,920
there Wetlands for instance contain a

243
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,920
real lot of uh carbon and you know a lot

244
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,760
of wetlands have been degraded over the

245
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,760
years restoring those Wetlands could

246
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,600
really absorb carbon so that puts it all

247
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,760
in the atmosphere but we can also

248
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,720
Harvest the carbon from the trees in the

249
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,160
vegetation and do other things with it

250
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,959
one thing people talk about doing is

251
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,279
making biochar which is like a soil

252
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,760
supplement and uh putting that in the

253
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,399
soil but basically where we are today

254
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
that's it and it in general it's a lot

255
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,959
cheaper to reduce emissions don't let it

256
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,360
get up in the atmosphere in the first

257
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:57,079
place but there are some removals that

258
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,120
are fairly inexpensive and if they are

259
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,760
and and like planting trees is one of

260
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,079
them

261
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,320
but there there are other issues with

262
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,959
that we can come back to specifically

263
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,760
the permanence issue that's a fine role

264
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,680
today but most of these other ones are

265
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,240
very um expensive so you really want to

266
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,000
reduce first but once we reduce 70 80

267
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,079
90% it starts getting very expensive to

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,040
reduce the last 10 or 20% and these are

269
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,800
what people sometimes call residual

270
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,440
emissions so it may be cheaper instead

271
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,839
of um trying to minate these residual

272
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,880
emissions to offset them or

273
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:39,000
counterbalance them with carbon removals

274
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,200
so to get fil fuels off an airplane is

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,519
not going to be easy if they Electrify

276
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,279
airplanes only be for small planes all

277
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,639
these airplanes are made for jet fuel

278
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,399
you know there's a lot of issues of

279
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,720
safety and everything so it may cost

280
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,959
$1,000 doll to try to get it off a plane

281
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,240
but we can remove it from the atmosphere

282
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,560
for a few hundred dollar that's a real

283
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,320
benefit so the ipcc which is the

284
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,480
International Panel of scientists to

285
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,360
which you belong or have belonged at

286
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,200
times chartered by the UN

287
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,839
fccc the United Nations framework

288
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,959
convention on climate change has become

289
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,839
very clear in their last couple of

290
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:19,320
reports about just what that removal

291
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,720
rate has to be by the middle of the

292
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,440
century and they're talking about

293
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,680
something like 10 billion tons a year

294
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,360
net are going to have to be removed by

295
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,199
us and put somewhere where it can't get

296
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
back into the atmosphere are you saying

297
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,959
that that's overstated because they're

298
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,279
underestimating how fast I'm saying

299
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:42,279
there's a lot of uncertainty in that

300
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:44,120
number and it's a debate to have in

301
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,279
mid-century when we're going to be a lot

302
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,680
smarter on on the cost and benefits of

303
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:52,279
all this because we can't start lowering

304
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,680
the stock of CO2 in the atmosphere until

305
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:58,600
we get to that zero so I think our full

306
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,120
focus should be getting on Net Zero and

307
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,240
you know we haven't been producing

308
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,079
emissions fast enough and I don't think

309
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,720
it's good to say oh that's okay because

310
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,160
if we overshoot we'll be able to remove

311
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,399
it and then they try to prove it I think

312
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,480
we should focus on reducing our

313
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,600
emissions as quickly as feasibly

314
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
possible there's technical feasibility

315
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,920
but there's also political feasibility

316
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,639
here that should be our focus and you

317
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,839
know we're developing these things to

318
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,839
remove it from the atmosphere right now

319
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,480
and we should continue doing that

320
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,839
modeling out to 2100 you know has a lot

321
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,680
of uh so so we we create the

322
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,320
Technologies and I know that you've gone

323
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,160
around the world visiting some of the

324
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,279
startup companies that are trying to

325
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,079
perfect technologies that can work what

326
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,120
have you learned and what what are your

327
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,760
feelings about what they're doing and

328
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,360
and the odds that will really have the

329
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,320
capacity well I mean I I think you're T

330
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,199
I mean what I focused on a bit recently

331
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,920
is the direct air capture yeah and I

332
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:03,079
don't know how many compies are out

333
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:07,399
there but I think it's probably over 30

334
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,959
DC they call it direct and um I've have

335
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,880
visited a couple of the leading

336
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,120
companies and there's one company clim

337
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,480
marks that's actually doing it so what

338
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,639
air are we talking about here are we

339
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,240
talking about air that comes out of like

340
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,279
power plants are we talking about just

341
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,000
like the regular air around us it's just

342
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:27,279
that regular air around us these are big

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,279
machines and they push the air through

344
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,440
the machines with big fans to move it

345
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:37,160
but basically the air is pretty much the

346
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,160
same everywhere it's uh has about 420

347
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,480
430 parts per million CO2 it goes

348
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,880
through the machines and it comes out

349
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,639
the other side they take out maybe 60 to

350
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,320
75% of the uh CO2 in the air that goes

351
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,920
through the machines wow so then if that

352
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,360
works for getting the carbon dioxide out

353
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,720
of the air why are we not running this

354
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,639
machines 247 every country is this the

355
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,600
solution

356
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,880
well that's what some people would like

357
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,079
and that's why this technology has sort

358
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,320
of become a darling with billions of

359
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:12,720
dollars being invested okay in it but

360
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,720
the bottom line is very costly so we

361
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,959
talked about uh like the uh European

362
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,920
trading system having a carbon price of

363
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:23,880
about $100 per ton if you go online

364
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:27,440
today to kimar's website you can buy

365
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,279
offsets and the cost there is $1,500 a

366
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,959
ton of carbon so so that's a lot of

367
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,839
money is that cuz they're gouging

368
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,600
consumers when they buy no car uh

369
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,319
actually they may be charging less than

370
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,600
the real cost so is the deal then that

371
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,399
okay yes they can run these machines 247

372
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,000
but it's going to cost them so much to

373
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,000
do it we can't afford it and it's not

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,959
just money it also costs a lot of energy

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,120
so you have to use clean energy if you

376
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,279
hooked up one of these machines to

377
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,360
coldfire power plant you would actually

378
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,440
put more CO2 in the atmosphere from the

379
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,079
coldfire power plant than you would

380
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,360
capture from these machines so you

381
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,720
really need seems like a bad decision

382
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,199
and the question is if we have that

383
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,000
carbon free energy is it better today to

384
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:17,639
use that to take CO2 out of the air or

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,399
is it better to uh supplant fossil fuels

386
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,720
we're using today with that clean energy

387
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,199
and it's almost the latter that's the

388
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,680
case so as I say carbon removal becomes

389
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:33,319
important as we start uh approaching Net

390
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,160
Zero get the last 20% or so of residual

391
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:37,920
emissions compensated for but today

392
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,920
there's a lot cheaper ways to reduce

393
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,480
emissions that's where our focus should

394
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,279
be and some people call uh things like

395
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,480
direct air capture you know a dangerous

396
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,880
distraction because of that because

397
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,920
we're not focused on reducing the

398
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:56,319
emissions today so okay so if you're a

399
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,720
government or you're a wealthy investor

400
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,720
you know investing fund and you're

401
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,399
thinking how to deploy money

402
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,319
you work in thinking about carbon

403
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
capture would you say like this is not

404
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,520
where to spend your money go spend it

405
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,919
somewhere else well I mean carbon

406
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,280
capture is different from carbon removal

407
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:16,799
I'm saying that I think there's good

408
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,959
reason to invest in carbon removal today

409
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,439
to develop the technology but to deploy

410
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,240
it at a large scale I don't think the

411
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,600
time is right yet but on the other hand

412
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,600
it could take 10 20 years to really get

413
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,240
these Technologies commercially ready

414
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,240
there's a lot of carbon removal

415
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,679
Technologies we don't know what are the

416
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,679
best and so working on them we're not

417
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,320
really spending a lot of money today in

418
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,120
the development of it now of course if

419
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,320
you have a company and trying to develop

420
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,760
this you want to deploy it as much as

421
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
possible you better have some patient

422
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,559
investors yeah but you either got to get

423
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,400
the cost way down which I think on some

424
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,440
of the things are going to be hard

425
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,159
because um to do it chemically it costs

426
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,760
a lot of money to uh develop this Alkali

427
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:06,360
the you need to process a tremendous

428
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,480
amount of air to get out um a good

429
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,760
amount of se2 because it's so dilute in

430
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,320
the air so if you want to capture a

431
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,080
million tons a year we put out in the

432
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,080
United States five billion tons of CO2 a

433
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,400
year so just to capture put out five

434
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,880
billion if you want to capture a million

435
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,919
a million tons which is okay but not so

436
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,440
great all right yeah yeah you need a

437
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,640
structure so so just think of the air

438
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,120
going in with a fan the cross-sectional

439
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,679
area is sort of the the thing

440
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
perpendicular so let think of it like a

441
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,880
building you need like a three story

442
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,799
building that's uh 3 miles long all

443
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,960
covered with fans that's to capture 1

444
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:50,559
million which is one 1,000th of a

445
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,360
billion of course and we got to get to

446
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,720
something like so you so if you want to

447
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,640
capture all the CO2 we're putting out it

448
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,559
it would take we don't we don't produce

449
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,679
enough electricity to Drive these things

450
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,360
to to even get our in the United States

451
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,120
to get our 5 billion but but as I'm

452
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,840
hearing you talk I mean your message is

453
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,400
sort of on different time frames let's

454
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,000
right now today yeah reduce our

455
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,440
emissions of CO2 where we can but in the

456
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,320
future when we need to start doing

457
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,960
removals use the lowcost options

458
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,159
available to us like growing biomass

459
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,000
making biochar sticking on the ground

460
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,000
and then and then look to the Future

461
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,720
when we might have the electrical

462
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
capacity and the efficiency in these

463
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,880
machines to start doing it actively

464
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,559
correct so this this tiered system and

465
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,440
we're buying time right and of course as

466
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,880
analysis we can say that but the real

467
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,880
world's messy yeah so when you have 30

468
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,000
companies out there developing direct

469
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,110
air capture Technologies they don't want

470
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,400
to

471
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:55,400
[Music]

472
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,679
wait so this there's direct capture but

473
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,360
I mean a lot of our colleagues here

474
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:07,679
lately have been talking about the idea

475
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:11,400
of direct ocean CER Dak and dock yeah

476
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,480
what's the idea there in a given volume

477
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,679
there's you know maybe a hundred times

478
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,559
or a little over a 100 times more carbon

479
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,520
in that volume of water than in the air

480
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,760
wow why why because water is a thousand

481
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,640
times denser than uh air ah okay so but

482
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,280
so you got to move you got to move the

483
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,760
same amount of mass that's what drives

484
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,679
it but

485
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,240
that doesn't guarantee you anything uh

486
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,360
actually the mass fraction in air uh of

487
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,880
of carbon is higher than it is in the

488
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,120
ocean also in the ocean it's not in the

489
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,000
form of CO2 it's uh dissolved carbon is

490
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,320
carbonates and bicarbonates primarily

491
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,919
and so therefore the technology to get

492
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,440
it out is different and once again from

493
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,760
things that I've read this is very early

494
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,840
stage of this but what I've read on this

495
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,280
subject so far is it takes a lot lot of

496
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,480
energy and maybe even more energy than

497
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,039
uh direct air capture right but but from

498
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,080
what you were saying earlier because the

499
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,159
the carbon is more concentrated in the

500
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,320
water the volume of water you have to

501
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,400
move through is much smaller and

502
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,120
therefore the machine is much smaller

503
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,080
not necessarily

504
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,240
oh why well it depends on how it comes

505
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,679
out and the main thing that they're

506
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,480
using that have come out now is

507
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,440
electrochemistry so yeah so your

508
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,320
cross-sectional area is smaller but

509
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,200
that's it takes energy to move air but

510
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,559
it also when you're putting these

511
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,320
through electrochemical devices those

512
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,760
devices take a lot of energy too not

513
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,200
necessarily move the air but to get that

514
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,880
carbon out of there then there's a whole

515
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,159
problem once you get the carbon out of a

516
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,440
certain amount of seawater you got to

517
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,960
put the sea water back in the ocean what

518
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,120
does that do because well would that

519
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,159
affect the ocean flux with the

520
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,679
atmosphere would that uh give you

521
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,360
environmental impacts when you're taking

522
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,799
out of seawater you're changing the

523
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,440
chemistry of that bit and when you put

524
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:07,640
it back in that's going to have some

525
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,360
impact so we got to really understand

526
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,400
that plus you know it's tough enough

527
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,720
getting uh a permit for a wind turban uh

528
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,520
when you're going to try to do things in

529
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,159
the ocean like that it's going to take

530
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,200
some time getting a permit I see you

531
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,600
think fisherman and so on might be

532
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,480
pushing back a little bit if you're

533
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,480
going to start I mean that's why it's

534
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,440
worth research now to understand these

535
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,159
things to answer these questions so when

536
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,600
you do go for a permit you have the

537
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,000
answers do you think I mean I know this

538
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,120
is projecting forward and I know we

539
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,960
don't have the answers but do you think

540
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,000
when we eventually figure out in

541
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,760
mid-century how we're going to address

542
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,880
climate change that the idea of actually

543
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:50,240
taking carbon out of the atmosphere Out

544
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,799
of Water whatever is going to be a big

545
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,360
player here and it won't just be let's

546
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,720
switch to wind let's switch to solar

547
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,279
let's switch the kind of cars we drive

548
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,799
ET it's because of the physics of the

549
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:05,200
problem it's hard for me saying it's

550
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:08,000
ever going to be cheap but what are the

551
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,159
impacts you know so we talk today you

552
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,120
know they talk about the social cost of

553
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,880
carbon which is really people give

554
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,440
numbers to it we don't know but what the

555
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,360
concept is is every time we emit some

556
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,000
carbon dioxide to the atmosphere there's

557
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,159
a cost of that and impacts from climate

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,520
change so if we want to remove it in the

559
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,679
future there'll be benefits how much are

560
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,720
those benefits yeah compared to the cost

561
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,480
of removing it that's the decision

562
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,799
people will make at that time and say is

563
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,840
it worth doing that I I keep an open

564
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,000
mind about it but I don't feel strongly

565
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,559
one way or another I just hope we

566
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,279
decrease emissions fast enough so it's

567
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:46,919
not going to be necessary for us to

568
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,480
remove that we don't get to your

569
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,640
research yet like you're the just in

570
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,159
case research well no I mean I started

571
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,200
on carbon capture and I think carbon

572
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,600
capture is a way to reduce emissions to

573
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,559
the atmosphere we're using more coal

574
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,760
today I mean Coal Keeps increasing the

575
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,039
US were you know closing coal plants but

576
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,799
China India are still building it you

577
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,279
know people are always going to want

578
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,440
energy and you know the question is you

579
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:17,000
know for them to do their missions doing

580
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,440
capturing a power plant uh can be cost

581
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,520
effective and that's a lot less money I

582
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,640
think once you build up carbon capture

583
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,679
and get the supply chains right you can

584
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,919
do it for under $100 a ton at at a at a

585
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,840
power plant from and maybe May you know

586
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,399
maybe even get closer to $50 a ton so

587
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,720
you know that's different than we're

588
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:38,240
talking numbers up now in the hundreds

589
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,360
of dollars or so so we haven't really

590
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,200
talked about where you put the CO2 once

591
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,600
you captured we talked about biochar a

592
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,120
little bit but so so basically where can

593
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,720
you put it so you know as I say there's

594
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,360
three reservoirs that they call

595
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,760
atmosphere Ocean and the terrestrial

596
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,559
biosphere so the more we put in the

597
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,080
ocean or the terrestrial

598
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,320
biosphere the Les is in the atmosphere

599
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,360
planting trees is one way to keep in the

600
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,799
terrestrial biosphere biochar is another

601
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,559
way to do that once again those are

602
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,080
issues of permanence will you really

603
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:16,039
keep it there for the length of time you

604
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,880
need or will things like uh pestilence

605
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,960
and fires you know uh disrupt some of it

606
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,360
or or even changes in land use but you

607
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,279
know you keep up there at least that has

608
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,080
the effect the other places are like I

609
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,399
mentioned enhanced Rock weathering you

610
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,640
turn it into rocks or you can put it

611
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:35,440
back into geologic formations so these

612
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,720
geologic formations are where we take

613
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,399
out oil and gas uh we can put them into

614
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,440
those same reservoirs or there's a lot

615
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:46,240
of geologic formations and and a lot

616
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,120
more of these than oil and gas

617
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,559
reservoirs uh that are uh basically deep

618
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,919
and they're filled with brine you want

619
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,840
to go over 800 M deep that way the CO2

620
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,720
stays in a dense phase a liquidlike

621
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:04,200
phase you can put them in those um

622
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,120
geologic formations and uh hopefully you

623
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,520
know we've had the oil and gas stay on

624
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,520
the ground for literally millions of

625
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:15,279
years so hopefully that's a permanent

626
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,720
solution so those are what you can do uh

627
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,880
is there enough space down there I mean

628
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,799
you have reservations about the the

629
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,760
limits of's a lot there's a lot of space

630
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,720
down there the theoretical space is very

631
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,799
large there's there's two issues one you

632
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,840
know how much that theoretical space can

633
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:35,799
we use and secondly it's not everywhere

634
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,399
you know it's in all parts of the world

635
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:41,360
but it's not in every place so for

636
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:43,240
instance um you know here in New England

637
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,279
we don't really have a lot of that

638
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,440
formation a lot of those formations are

639
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,000
where you see oil and gas production

640
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,960
today we do have we do potentially have

641
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,120
some capacity here in New England uh

642
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,960
offshore but it hasn't really been

643
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,760
explored because the places people have

644
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,240
explored Underground or where they're

645
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,279
trying to get out fossil fuels I guess

646
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,640
that's another big application of of CO2

647
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,480
once it's captured to use it to pump

648
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,080
into active oil and gas reserves to

649
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,240
produce more efficiently CO2 is good at

650
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,320
um you pump CO2 into an active oil

651
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,440
reservoir what they call mobilize the

652
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,399
oil it changes the oil viscosity so it

653
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,440
flows better so there so there's an

654
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,840
irony there but but is that also

655
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,360
potentially a pathway to almost have a

656
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,679
circular flow of carbon from the

657
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,799
reservoir out to where we use it back in

658
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:42,279
agains you know you can maybe produce

659
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,519
carbon neutral oil that way but that

660
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,919
that's not a negative emission or or or

661
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,600
or in the long run it's you know you

662
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,200
really got to cut back but what that's

663
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,919
been useful for it's been a stepping

664
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,480
stone to help some of these initial

665
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,200
projects you know which are financially

666
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,559
challenged uh to begin with uh it helps

667
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,320
finances those projects because they can

668
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,120
actually sell the CO2 and get a little

669
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,440
money for it in fact accidental

670
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,039
petroleum but but uh what was it carbon

671
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,200
engineering carbon engineering correct

672
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:14,480
to to do precisely that inject carbon

673
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,799
into their Wells to more oil atmosphere

674
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,279
to produce oil with the idea that it's a

675
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,320
stepping stone I guess well we'll just

676
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,559
say oxy's a little more bullish on all

677
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,360
this than I am uh you know they they

678
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,559
want to have a half a million ton of

679
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,159
year plant operating by the the end of

680
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:34,679
next year um I saw VI talking about this

681
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,360
recently she's she's quite convincing

682
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,519
when when you hear her but yeah I'm I'm

683
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,159
going FR path I'm going to go back to

684
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,640
the old British proverb the proof is in

685
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,519
the pudding so well Warren Buffett's

686
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,159
bullish I he's been he's so sold on the

687
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,399
story that oxy's putting out that he's

688
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,120
acquired most of the company wow well

689
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:58,720
doin

690
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,799
right I uh I take a wait and see

691
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,519
attitude um I know we wanted to I think

692
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,919
finally talk about some of

693
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:11,559
the maybe more Fringe ideas of like how

694
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,440
to like really geoengineer if we think

695
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,080
wow things are getting too hot there's

696
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,559
too much carbon out there what can we do

697
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,000
and I feel like these efforts to change

698
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,000
like clouds change the weather these

699
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,559
kinds of things like they get a lot of

700
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,240
media attention I don't know if they

701
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,240
deserve the media attention but they

702
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,720
seem I think so interesting and exciting

703
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,440
that people can't resist talking about

704
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,760
them so just first of all talk about

705
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,640
like what kinds of things do people talk

706
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,320
about that you might be able to do and

707
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,519
then tell us if like you can really do

708
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,679
that yeah it's the most common one

709
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,000
people talk about our solar Radiance

710
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,480
management putting up a sun sheet and

711
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,279
the the the most common there is putting

712
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,480
aerosol particles up in the stratosphere

713
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,880
and so it reflect sunlight so this

714
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,120
doesn't do anything to the carbon

715
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,039
dioxide but it it cools the Earth so

716
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,519
wait so the idea is you've got Sun the

717
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:10,880
sun's Rays coming down and you're like

718
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,000
no let's reflect them back right we

719
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,880
don't want them here okay and there's a

720
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,640
whole series of of things to do it that

721
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,159
so this goes back a long time there was

722
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,440
a uh National Academy study sometime

723
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,960
around 1990 I can't remember the exact

724
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,600
date and it was really thick it might

725
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,279
have been a th pages

726
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,159
and they had like a uh 15 or so page

727
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,760
appendix they had a lot of appendixes

728
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,760
and one was on geoengineering so there's

729
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,240
a really thick report this one appendix

730
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,640
there was an art and I still have the

731
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,919
article in my drawer an article in

732
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,159
Newsweek called the wings of Icarus a

733
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:48,880
two-page spread and all they talked

734
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,640
about from that report were the

735
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,440
geoengineering ones you know talked

736
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:58,080
about shooting um Navy shells up in the

737
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,559
atmosphere to do sades and putting a sun

738
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,080
shade you know actually putting things

739
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:03,600
in space at some of these lran points

740
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,240
still talking about I know they're still

741
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,760
talking about it and it's something

742
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,120
people like to talk about I actually

743
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,679
have a section in the new book saying is

744
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,120
carbon removal

745
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,960
geoengineering and I think the answer it

746
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,159
there's an array and it depends how you

747
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,440
define geoengineering people don't know

748
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,480
so people say when we're Ming CO2 up our

749
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,440
chimneys or our tail pipes is a

750
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,240
geoengineering experiment cuz we're

751
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,679
changing the Earth is causing climate

752
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,200
change in that case anytime we remove it

753
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,919
would be two but probably the most

754
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,320
benign uh in terms of that is direct air

755
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,679
capture because you're really not

756
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,960
affecting anything except taking the CO2

757
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,519
out of the air and I think and that's

758
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,399
another reason people like it a lot and

759
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,919
the Other Extreme is uh this ocean

760
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:52,080
alkalinity uh enhancement where you're

761
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,559
putting uh alkaline subjects in the

762
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,279
ocean so so you can get more carbon stor

763
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,039
accelerated sort of dissolution of Co 2

764
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:02,600
into the ocean yeah when you put more

765
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:06,840
Alkali in the ocean it it it will absorb

766
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,399
more CO2 from the um atmosphere and also

767
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,880
it will neutralize a little of the ocean

768
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:14,039
acidification that's being caused by the

769
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,039
extra CO2 going in the ocean right now

770
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,000
so it looks pretty interesting but

771
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,279
there's a lot of uh questions on what

772
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,960
the uh impacts so it'll be something

773
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:27,399
that go slow but that's that really is

774
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,200
geoengineering um even though there once

775
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:33,960
again you are affecting the CO2 in the

776
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,440
atmosphere as opposed to trying to you

777
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,760
know when you're trying to manage the

778
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,080
solar radiation there's no guarantee

779
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,000
it's going to be an exact match so some

780
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,120
places it make make climate change

781
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,880
impacts worse while make it better in

782
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,960
other places and then of course I would

783
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,039
suggest you become a lawyer so you can

784
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,000
take all the law cases suing the people

785
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:57,320
that that the solar Radiance it sounds

786
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,159
like you're like you're skeptical and

787
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,320
it's also so I I would think impossible

788
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,120
to test many of these things out like

789
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,320
until you just do it you decide we're

790
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,080
going to pull the trigger and do this

791
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,440
yeah down the street or maybe I should

792
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,320
say up the river at Harvard um they were

793
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,240
going to do an experiment on this in

794
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,480
Sweden and uh it ran into opposition and

795
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,120
they they they never ran the experiment

796
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,919
because of the the local opposition I

797
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,360
think it's hard to run an experiment on

798
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,360
that there's there's research you can do

799
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,200
to better understand it the best

800
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,399
experiments are natural experiments so

801
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,000
when a volcano erupts that's basically

802
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:38,399
what they're trying to do so we have

803
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,320
data from that but it's what I said in

804
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,279
my first book geoengineering is a hail

805
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,480
Mar pass in football and you ask any

806
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:49,159
football coach you want to avoid the

807
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,039
Hail Mary yeah so I guess that that same

808
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,519
it doesn't work most of the time but

809
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,080
that same caution applies to direct

810
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,360
ocean capture as well from what you were

811
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,440
saying earlier we're going to be

812
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,039
affecting the alkalinity of the ocean

813
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,600
and its biology very locally and that

814
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:06,840
could have real impacts unlike Capt it

815
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,280
from the atmosphere the D dilute nature

816
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,399
of what's in the atmosphere is actually

817
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,960
advantageous so so you know I think when

818
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:17,200
you work in the ocean you are much more

819
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,280
on the geoengineering Fringe than say

820
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,879
planting trees or restoring Wetlands so

821
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,359
can we do it I mean can

822
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:31,119
we use these techniques to

823
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:32,839
address this increase we have in our in

824
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,240
our missions and and head off climate

825
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,119
change or is that even the right way to

826
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,359
think about it there there's a there's a

827
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,760
person uh that I worked with in the past

828
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,639
from Oak Ridge named Greg Marland and

829
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,159
once again this is back 25 years ago he

830
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,720
ran a little Symposium and in the

831
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,040
morning it said can we

832
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,919
geoengineer the climate and then the

833
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,520
afternoon session was should we

834
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:58,160
geoengineer the climate what could

835
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,560
possibly go wrong

836
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:05,720
so I I think the most important thing we

837
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,960
can do now is reduce emissions as

838
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,520
quickly as possible and so maybe I I can

839
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,320
end where the uh last statement of the

840
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,200
new book we wrote and the best way to

841
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,160
remove CO2 from the atmosphere is not to

842
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,079
put CO2 in the atmosphere in the first

843
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,560
place great

844
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,720
