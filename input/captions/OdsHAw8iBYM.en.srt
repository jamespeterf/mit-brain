1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,120
now those of you who have been around

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,719
MIT for a while know that MIT one

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,920
University one MIT we call it has five

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,560
schools and one college and the five

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,400
schools are

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,119
engineering science architecture

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,720
planning Humanities and the MIT School

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,840
of Management plus the College of

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,760
computing the Sloan School of Management

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,280
has a very unique

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,520
Mission and it works globally to educate

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,559
and do research and back in

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,640
2013 they opened an office in South

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,640
America in Chile to serve as a central

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
point of contact for many of their

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,160
activities whether they be educational

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,280
or research or collaboration or

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,280
networking and that was very

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,040
successful and it turns out that they

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,799
then focused on where should we have a

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,960
physical presence in Southeast

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,320
Asia and they pick Bangkok to be the

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:21,680
center of aan to bring people together

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,560
from all across the region for all of

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,640
the activities that support the mission

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,799
of the Soul School of Management and

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,360
what I'm going to do now is just spend a

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,439
very few minutes talking about that

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,720
office I was honored to be at the ribbon

30
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,159
cutting just a couple months ago with

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,680
many of you here in the audience many of

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,759
our corporate uh sponsors of this

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,680
program and the industrial Asen program

34
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,479
have also kindly sponsored the Azan

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,600
office here in Bangkok the ribbon

cutting was held on the 30th of October

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,439
and there you can see the sponsors as

38
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,840
well as the then interim Dean Georgia

39
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,520
paracas of the MIT SLO School of

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,399
Management during the ribbon

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,039
cutting the mission is to act as a

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,160
bridge to bring action learning

43
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,400
convening activities faculty from all of

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,560
MIT together with the purpose of

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,680
building visibility and Community while

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,200
also driving the economic and social

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,040
impact throughout the region of

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,160
aan and you can see that they have

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,680
decided upon a structure of governance

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,040
that includes an advisory Council which

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,519
is is being formed this year the first

52
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,680
year of operation my understanding is

53
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,680
that there'll be a full-time executive

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,080
director of The Office who will be

55
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,760
stationed uh here in Bangkok they're in

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,800
the process of recruiting for that

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,599
position and the three pillars of the

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,680
office include faculty research action

59
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:54,879
learning and convening activities and

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,120
the faculty research has in fact been

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,760
very robust for many years here in

62
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,080
Bangkok with funding from industry and

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,159
