1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,839
And our second speaker and is he there

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,360
he is okay is Ben Kleinstever

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,960
colleague of mine at Massachusetts

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,880
General Hospital Center for Genomic

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,040
Medicine. Uh and he's going to be

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
talking about you know what I think was

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,760
science fiction about a decade ago but

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,920
now seems very real and very salient. So

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
take it away Ben.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,240
>> All right. Wonderful. Thanks for the

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,599
invitation to Molina uh to come speak at

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,119
the symposium. It's been really

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
interesting to to learn from all of you

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,200
in a field that's a little adjacent to

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,880
my own. So bear with me as I tell you

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
something a little tangential to what

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,960
you've been talking about so far today,

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,320
but more about the variant to medicine

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,239
or variant to therapeutics approach.

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
Um some quick disclosures, none of which

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,920
are uh relevant to what I'll tell you

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,280
today.

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,120
Uh and first of course just

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
acknowledging the folks in my group uh

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,160
who I have the pleasure of showing you

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,160
their data today and telling you their

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
stories. So obviously very grateful to

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,440
work with these um talented and and

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,000
really motivated trainees.

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,000
So what I hope to tell you today is a

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,439
story that's 10 years in the making. How

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,920
do we go from genetic diagnosis of uh

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
specific mutations, non-inherited but

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,640
sort of uh either inherited or

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,960
non-inherited mutations uh and draw on a

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,759
toolbox of genome editing technologies

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,280
to rapidly treat uh individual

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
mutations?

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
um and can we think about ways to scale

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,119
this and do this more rapidly for

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,759
patients and then if I have time at the

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
end I'll tell you uh how we're thinking

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
about other technologies that would

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
allow us to leap beyond sort of one

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,920
patient at a time uh but now think about

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,479
treating thousands at a time for even

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,479
rare diseases.

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,720
So I think as you all know genome

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,840
editing technologies have given us a

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,000
really unprecedented ability to go and

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,439
pick at individual letters in our three

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,119
billion bases of DNA in our genomes. And

53
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,520
I won't belabor this slide for the sake

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,280
of time but just the pie chart beside

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,439
the the cartoon here I think is really

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,119
important to frame how we think about

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,920
genome editing from a technology

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,440
development perspective. Um and this is

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,200
just showing the different types of

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,319
genetic lesions that cause human

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,760
disease. So from single letter mutations

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,160
to small deletions or large copy um

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,840
gains or losses uh what this really

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
means is that we need a diversity of

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,120
tools to go and think about correcting

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,080
all kinds of different genetic disease.

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,440
So for the sake of the first maybe 15

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
minutes that I'll tell you I'm going to

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
focus on tools that allow us to make

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,599
single letter changes to the genome. And

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,280
these are really acutely actionable in

72
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,280
the clinic because the tools to correct

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,920
these types of mutations are quite

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
efficient and quite precise given the

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,160
tremendous development of techn these

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,440
technologies called base editors over

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,519
the last decade or so.

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,360
So I'll tell you quickly about base

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,319
editors. So they were developed here at

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,720
the broad institute by David Lu's lab.

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,280
Um these are a really amazing technology

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,319
that are built on a crisper cast 9

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,480
enzyme chassis. The crispercast enzymes

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,440
role in a base editing reaction is to

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,599
locate a target site to bind it and to

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,959
expose a small part of singlestranded

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,879
DNA. So um here we're trying to expose a

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,720
few letters in a a target site to make

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,640
that accessible for an enzyatic process.

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,400
The second part of a base editor is the

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,959
diaminise domain. And this is the really

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,640
key function of a base editor where now

93
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,599
when we have this single strand of DNA

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,159
exposed the diaminise can go and perform

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,200
some chemistry on these individual

96
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,360
letters. Uh so if you're trying to

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,440
convert an A to a G, this happens

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200
through adinine dam oops adinine

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,680
damination

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,640
um to innine and then through subsequent

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,560
repair we get a G in place upon removal

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,319
of the inosine. So this is one flavor of

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,319
several different types of base editors

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,319
that have been developed. Uh the two

105
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,480
major classes are called adinine base

106
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,760
editors and cytosine base editors. And

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,239
these essentially give you the ability

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,239
to make a to g or c to t changes.

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
And this is of course again important as

110
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
we think about correcting um human

111
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,560
pathogenic mutations where between these

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,840
two classes of base editors we can now

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,880
in principle address more than 60% of

114
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,880
known single letter mutations.

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
But there's a big challenge for

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,040
implementing base editors to correct

117
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,880
pathogenic mutations. And this uh is

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,000
dependent on a simple property of

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,080
crisper proteins called the pam. So a

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
cast 9 protein to find its target site

121
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,720
has to recognize a short sequence called

122
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,479
a PAM. For the commonly used castine

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,160
protein, this is just two guanine

124
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,560
nucleotides. So this occurs pretty

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,320
frequently. And the position of this is

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,880
quite important because the PAM has to

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
be at a certain distance away from your

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,120
edit that you want to make so that you

129
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,680
can basically place the diaminise over

130
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
top of this single stranded DNA. So what

131
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,040
this means when you go to use a base

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,639
editor is that there's an a window of

133
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,039
editing efficiency and we call this a

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
base editor edit window and we have to

135
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,800
have a pam at the right distance

136
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,520
upstream to put the diaminise over top

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,680
of our edit of interest.

138
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,080
A second key consideration here is that

139
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,400
the edit window is a couple bases wide.

140
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,199
So we also want to avoid editing

141
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
unintended bases nearby uh because this

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,039
can result in what we call bystander

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
editing. So if you want to edit this A,

144
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
you may not want to edit this other A

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,680
that could be directly adjacent to it or

146
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,000
maybe a few bases away. So there are a

147
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,320
few strategies to try and mitigate uh

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
the editing of bystander bases and one

149
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,560
of which is of course just choosing a

150
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,080
different guide RNA and positioning the

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,080
target site by a different bioues.

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
Okay. So uh but again the bottom line

153
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
here is to be able to base edit

154
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,680
efficiently and to correct pathogenic

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,080
mutations we have to have PAMS in the

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,000
right spot and if you had a pathogenic

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,680
mutation shown here in this diagram and

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,520
no PAMS in the right position we

159
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,919
wouldn't be able to perform that base

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
edit.

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,560
So this really has been an opportunity

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,479
for my lab and others to go and take

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,240
these amazing proteins that came out of

164
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,479
nature and use methods called protein

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
engineering to build a really rich

166
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,280
toolbox of cast 9 proteins that now give

167
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,800
us the precision to place base editors

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,720
wherever we would like.

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
So a few years ago we came up with one

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,919
potential solution to this problem where

171
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
again if you're using the naturally

172
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,160
occurring crisper cast proteins you have

173
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,639
a bunch of blind spots where you can't

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,000
base edit. We engineered what we called

175
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,680
a PAMless version of cast 9 called spry.

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
Uh where that essentially without

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,919
requiring a pam anymore, we could place

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,479
the base editor anywhere across the

179
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,560
genome. This now gave us the ability to

180
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,120
perform base edits at nearly any base of

181
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
the genome using a single castine

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,960
protein.

183
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
This protein's been useful to us and

184
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,880
others for lots of other applications

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,960
beyond base editing. So here just

186
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,599
highlighting one example where we've

187
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,759
used this enzyme as a nucleus in vitro

188
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,400
to digest DNA in place of restriction

189
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,319
enzymes. Um Russell Walton in my group

190
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
was the person who engineered this

191
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
protein. He's now doing his PhD here at

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the Broad. This is a picture of Russell

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,919
holding a tube of sprry that is now sold

194
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,080
by NEB. I think he was the first

195
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,400
customer to to buy this excitedly and is

196
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,319
still waiting for his 3-cent royalty. Um

197
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,720
so I think that's one of again many

198
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,280
potential uses of a pamless cast 9

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,080
protein. Uh we and others have gone on

200
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,560
to use enzymes like sprry hooked up to

201
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,240
um base editors and and to prime editors

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
for therapeutics and pre-clinical

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
applications and now with my colleague

204
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,479
succeeded raven at the NH even in a

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
clinical trial to treat a primary immune

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,720
deficiency.

207
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
Um but one of the potential issues of

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,080
using a pamless enzyme is that uh by

209
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,759
design we've allowed this enzyme to

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,319
access the whole genome to give us the

211
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
precision to edit anywhere. So we have

212
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
these big boosts in targeting range. But

213
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,199
a potential consequence here is that

214
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,240
we've lost some specificity. So with

215
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,800
wild type cast 9, it requires a PAM. It

216
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
can only access part of the genome. That

217
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,400
creates issues for being able to to edit

218
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,919
any specific base. But that by some ways

219
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
makes the enzyme somewhat specific

220
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,440
because it can't access much of the

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,960
genome and it may encounter fewer

222
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,879
offtargets.

223
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,280
But with a pamless enzyme and this is a

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,919
vast oversimplification of of a cartoon

225
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,399
here um it in theory has access to the

226
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,120
entire genome. So it can encounter more

227
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,640
theoretical potential offtarget sites.

228
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
Uh and we and others have actually shown

229
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,720
that when you use a pamless enzyme the

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,320
rates of offtarget editing can increase.

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
And it turns out actually our goal when

232
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,279
we were building the spry protein

233
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
actually was not to do this all along.

234
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,040
We were trying to do something else. And

235
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,519
the simplest evolutionary trajectory

236
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,760
that we found to get to this phenotype

237
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,399
of not requiring uh to changing a PAM

238
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,560
was uh we kept making the enzyme lose

239
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
its PAM preference. What we were trying

240
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,640
to do actually was instead of removing

241
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,240
the PAM, we were trying to make lots of

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
different proteins that had different

243
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,839
PAM requirements because then each

244
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
individual protein would be safe because

245
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,839
it would still be restricted to a subset

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
of the genome. But if we engineered

247
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
enough of these proteins, we would have

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
the same comprehensive genome targeting

249
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
as you would get with a Pamless protein.

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,040
So an example that would look something

251
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,200
like this where instead of building one

252
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,600
enzyme to edit anywhere, our goal

253
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
originally was to build many enzymes

254
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,279
that had really specific PAM

255
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
requirements and then you could draw

256
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,480
from this toolbox of enzymes for any

257
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,720
given editing application.

258
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,360
So when I started my lab seven years

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,240
ago, our one of our really key goals was

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,120
to learn enough about what controlled

261
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,320
how cast 9 reads its PAM to get to the

262
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
point where we could develop a model

263
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,920
where we could go and now predict a new

264
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,680
enzyme for any given sequence of

265
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,000
interest. Uh I'm going to simplify seven

266
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,839
years of research in two slides. So to

267
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,720
do this, we had to first build some

268
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,880
assays to uh more scalably characterize

269
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,120
crisper proteins. Uh before we built

270
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,959
this assay, poor Russell would sit in

271
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,360
the cold room and purify proteins one at

272
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,760
a time. Uh but by developing this assay

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,399
where we could now screen proteins 100

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,440
or 400 at a time in different types of

275
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,360
um 96 well plate plastic wear, we could

276
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,680
think about profiling thousands of

277
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,880
proteins to gain enough data to train

278
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,720
machine learning models. So uh when

279
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,399
Rachel joined my lab during COVID for

280
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
her rotation project, we thought this

281
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
would be sort of a simple thing to do.

282
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,880
It ended up being her entire 5-year

283
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,120
thesis project. Uh but what we wanted to

284
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,040
do was learn enough about the

285
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,360
relationship between the amino acid

286
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,720
sequence of cast 9 and its PAM

287
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,320
requirement. And if we could do this

288
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,279
across enough proteins, could we then

289
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,200
begin to predict new proteins bespoke

290
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,880
for a specific genetic use cases?

291
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,720
So saying that again a different way,

292
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,040
what Rachel then did was basically

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,360
create large libraries of castine

294
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,279
proteins, deeply characterize their

295
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,040
properties using this assay that Russell

296
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,040
built. And by screening and

297
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,120
characterizing over a thousand cast 9

298
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,079
proteins, Rachel could then take that

299
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,320
data and uh uh train a machine learning

300
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,279
model based on the input of amino acid

301
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,800
sequence and also the PAM profiles and

302
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,519
then begin to think about creating a

303
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,200
model where if we wanted to uh design a

304
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,440
protein that could target a specific

305
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,240
sequence, could we then draw from this

306
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,000
toolbox of 64 million cast 9 proteins

307
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,399
and predict really efficient and

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,200
specific enzymes from that set?

309
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,560
So here's one potential example uh of

310
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,240
how uh this model would perform. So I

311
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
have these animations backwards. I

312
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
apologize. So what we did with Luca

313
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,480
Panella's lab at MGH was design a

314
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
website where someone could go and input

315
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
their uh parameters of the crisper

316
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,800
protein that they would want. So for

317
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,760
instance in this case here for uh this

318
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,800
redopsin p23h mutation that causes

319
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,880
autoomal dominant blindness we need a

320
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,519
really specific type of crispercast

321
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,320
enzyme. On the mutant alil we have an

322
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,600
ngtg pam and on the wild type alil we

323
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
have an nggg pam. The canonical

324
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,360
crispercast protein would be really good

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,200
at recognizing the wild type alil but

326
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,040
really bad at recognizing the mutant al.

327
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
So this is essentially backwards of what

328
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
we would want to treat this genetic

329
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
disease because we want to be able to

330
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,480
knock out the mutant alil and leave the

331
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,160
wild type alone.

332
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,880
So what we can now do is we can go into

333
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,040
this Pamela uh prediction model using

334
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,440
the simple web interface. We can input

335
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,959
these design parameters like maximizing

336
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,760
efficiency on an NGTG PAM and minimizing

337
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,320
efficiency on NGGG and then have the

338
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,480
model spit out two or 10 different cast

339
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,480
proteins that we can go and test in a

340
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,800
cell model.

341
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,440
So this is what we did. So we created a

342
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,279
HEC 293 model uh that encoded this

343
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,360
genetic mutation. uh forgive the um

344
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,519
genetics of HEC293 cells where we have

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,320
two copies of the mutant alil and one

346
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,959
copy of the wild type al. If we use the

347
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
wild type cast 9 protein spcast 9, what

348
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,600
we found as expected is that the wild

349
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,600
type cast 9 protein is very effective at

350
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,320
knocking out the wild type al because it

351
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
can recognize ng but it can't recognize

352
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,000
ngtg. So this is really not what we

353
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
want. We want to leave the wild type

354
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,560
alil alone.

355
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,399
If we take our PAM relaxed enzyme that I

356
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,399
told you about a few slides ago that can

357
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,160
recognize sort of the whole genome, it

358
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,480
can recognize in theory both of these

359
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,200
alals equally. That's exactly what we

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,600
observe. We saw editing both on the NG

361
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,279
wild type AL and the NGT mutant al. But

362
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,279
now taking one of the Pamela predicted

363
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,600
enzymes, what we found was a reversal in

364
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,920
the biology of cast 9 where we preserved

365
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
now um the wild type AL. We left it

366
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,320
alone because this new enzyme can't

367
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,240
target NG and we observed really

368
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
substantial editing on the mutant alil

369
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,839
because we're able to design a protein

370
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,680
that could access this new NGT space.

371
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,360
So this is one of many potential

372
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,920
examples where you can now use this

373
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
model to go and predict specific enzymes

374
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,519
for individual use cases. Um and again

375
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,079
this was built on many years of our

376
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,680
learnings about the biology of cast 9

377
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,839
and building the right assays to create

378
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,440
training data. now to the point where we

379
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,399
have a model that can go and predict

380
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,639
bespoke cast 9 proteins for individual

381
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,720
genetic sequences.

382
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,959
Um the end result here is that we have

383
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,360
really a massive toolbox of crispercast

384
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,040
enzymes that are individually safe. Um

385
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,600
they tend to be much more efficient than

386
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,959
PAM relaxed enzymes because they uh

387
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,040
aren't searching the whole genome for

388
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,959
their targets and together we have

389
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,959
enough of them now that we do still have

390
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,600
the ability to target the genome with

391
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,360
high versatility.

392
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,279
Um, we've shown that these enzymes

393
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,920
behave really nicely as base editors for

394
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,600
single letter changes um and across

395
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
other types of editing platforms like

396
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,639
prime editors and other next generation

397
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,720
genome editing tools.

398
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,760
So now I'll show you an example of where

399
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,079
we can now implement this uh type of uh

400
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,079
prediction and implementation approach

401
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,480
uh clinically.

402
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,920
So actually first I'll just again frame

403
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,959
this problem. So where we started in

404
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,519
sort of 2012 with wild type crisper cast

405
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,600
9 proteins like spcast 9 is this was an

406
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,320
amazing tool that allowed us to access

407
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,560
some of the genome. Uh and now we have

408
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,360
many different types of pam variant cast

409
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,680
9 proteins that uh allow us to access

410
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
access the genome with really incredible

411
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,120
versatility with a single protein like

412
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,199
spry or now in many cases like for

413
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,880
therapeutics we have these Pamela

414
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,800
designed enzymes or other rationally

415
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,639
designed enzymes from my lab. They give

416
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,040
us the ability to have the same

417
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,440
targeting range as one would with SPRY

418
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,560
uh but now each enzyme being much um

419
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
safer and much more efficient. Uh I do

420
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,839
think there are lots of really

421
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,560
interesting use cases for each type of

422
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,240
uh protein. Um having one enzyme that

423
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,839
can do lots of things is really amazing

424
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,519
for the type of work that we've heard a

425
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,680
lot about today for functional genomics

426
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,759
and doing really dense tiling screens of

427
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,240
regulatory elements and even protein

428
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,279
coding sequences. Uh but in my world

429
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,959
where we're more concerned about

430
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,040
therapeutics, we really do want sort of

431
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,079
the the best athlete. We want an enzyme

432
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,000
that's efficient and safe uh and uh

433
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,560
versatile.

434
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,720
So here's one specific example uh where

435
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,720
we can sort of rapidly now implement

436
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,880
this pipeline to predict these bespoke

437
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,480
proteins. So Kieran Musenure, who

438
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,759
trained here at MGH, but now runs a

439
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
research lab at the University of

440
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,519
Pennsylvania, emailed me last summer

441
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,399
essentially saying that they have this

442
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,600
really sick infant who has a a metabolic

443
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,399
disease, a mutation in the CPS1 gene, um

444
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,560
causing a ura cycle disorder, and that

445
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,040
they'd already screened some of our PAM

446
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,880
laxed enzymes for base editing and found

447
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
that they could achieve reasonable

448
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,399
levels of editing. uh but just wondered

449
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,880
before they pulled the trigger on

450
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,120
manufacturing this uh mRNA to treat this

451
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,400
patient, did we have something that was

452
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,640
maybe more efficient and safer?

453
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
So I went and looked at this specific

454
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
sequence that uh this infant had. He

455
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
actually inherited two mutations in this

456
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,640
gene. Uh this one was actually the most

457
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,280
correctable by base editing. So this was

458
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,120
the the better target. And when we look

459
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,120
at this genetic mutation here, this is

460
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,679
the A that we need to convert back to a

461
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,959
G to remove the stop codon and restore

462
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,720
the natural glutamine codon here. How

463
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,480
one then approaches this is we would

464
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,120
look for adinine base editors because

465
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,120
these make a tog edits. And then we

466
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,120
could design some target sites for this

467
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,440
crispercast base editor that would

468
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,679
position the edit window over top of

469
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,600
this admin. It may be a little difficult

470
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,120
to see, but here I'm showing the PAMS of

471
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,080
these target sites, and you'll see there

472
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,080
are no NGS at the right spot upstream.

473
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,960
So, we have to use either a PAMLaxed

474
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,400
enzyme or some of these uh more designed

475
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,799
custom proteins that we've built

476
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,200
recently.

477
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,160
So, Kieran's lab had tested uh these

478
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,000
pamlaxed enzymes like SPG and Spry, and

479
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,760
they found that some of them combined

480
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
with certain guide RNAs could achieve

481
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,840
levels of editing that in theory would

482
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,000
be beneficial to this patient.

483
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,320
Um but again coming back to this

484
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,120
question you know did we have something

485
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,880
that was safer uh although the the

486
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,960
pamless enzymes did work in this case

487
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,520
could we use something from this uh

488
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,280
toolbox of proteins to make this edit

489
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,679
with fewer offtarget risks.

490
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,000
So here we have this amazing uh

491
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
opportunity to test all these enzymes

492
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
that we've built over the years where

493
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,720
Kieran's group had already tested the

494
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,240
Pamlax proteins and now we could go and

495
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,240
predict a bespoke protein from our

496
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
Pamela model and even at the same time

497
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
maybe test some other enzymes that we'd

498
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,280
been engineering in the lab uh over the

499
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
last six years. So these sort of

500
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,039
rationally engineered human-designed

501
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,600
proteins.

502
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,600
Um okay so here's some of the data that

503
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,440
went into this. So again the initial

504
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,919
result that Kieran had sent me were

505
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,840
using the PAM relaxed enzyme with this

506
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,559
specific guide RNA achieving the the

507
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,240
therapeutic threshold in their early

508
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,400
test. So I got this email from him at

509
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,400
like 3:00 a.m. He had just Kieran had

510
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,320
analyzed the NGS data um himself. uh the

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
Pamela enzyme, we had just sent him one

512
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
prediction from our model compared to

513
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,080
two of these manually engineered enzymes

514
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
that we'd been building for five years

515
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,840
and found that all three of these

516
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,880
proteins outperformed the PAM relaxed

517
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,039
enzyme to correct this genetic mutation.

518
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,200
And when we further stress tested these

519
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,200
enzymes by making the diaminise a little

520
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,400
bit weaker to make it safer so that it

521
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,960
wouldn't have as many offtarget edits on

522
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,200
RNA, what we found is that the the

523
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,520
Pamela designed enzyme here outperformed

524
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,640
the Pamless enzyme and also these two

525
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,160
other rationally engineered proteins. So

526
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
saying that a different way actually the

527
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,000
the ML designed protein really

528
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,280
outperformed the human engineered

529
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
proteins that we've been building for

530
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,799
years. This isn't always the case, but

531
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,039
in this specific example, it was. Um, so

532
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,799
having the the fortune of a toolbox now

533
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,320
allows us to really identify these

534
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,240
efficacious and safe enzymes.

535
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,240
So this was just the start of a really

536
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
remarkable story that I'm sure many of

537
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,440
you heard about, have heard about uh

538
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,720
this treatment, uh, this really amazing

539
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,799
timeline for baby KJ. Um, getting the

540
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,120
diagnosis really within a few days after

541
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,360
birth. Uh Kieran's lab developed this

542
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,080
patient specific cell line. We sent them

543
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,400
some editors to try. They rapidly tried

544
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,320
that within I think about 10 days. They

545
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
already had results. Um quickly

546
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,640
generated a mouse model and did some

547
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,960
experiments in non-human primates. All

548
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,679
in about a six-month time frame to begin

549
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,400
dosing a baby KJ with a first low dose

550
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,480
of this therapy.

551
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,080
Um I'll point you to the the paper that

552
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,440
came out in the New England Journal that

553
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,760
really deeply describes the story.

554
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,840
Again, this was led by Kieran Musenuru

555
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
and Becca Erenss Nicholas at UPEN. We

556
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,440
played a small role in designing the the

557
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,520
protein chassis that went into this

558
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,440
therapeutic. The bottom line here is

559
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,400
that this young boy who had a

560
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,159
devastating metabolic disease that 50%

561
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,559
of patients with these mutations die in

562
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,440
the first year of life um now can

563
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:12,159
consume a normal protein diet uh and has

564
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,320
returned home with his family. So, lots

565
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,400
was written about this in May when this

566
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,400
uh story first broke in the New York

567
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
Times and all kind of other media

568
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,520
outlets. Uh if you've got 10 minutes

569
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,600
tonight, go on to just Google Upen Baby

570
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,720
KJ video and there's a 10-minute video

571
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,480
that really nicely describes um all the

572
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,000
amazing discoveries and collaboration

573
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,799
that led to the development of this

574
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,480
therapeutic. Um

575
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,240
this is something that I think is you

576
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,760
know really motivating for our field and

577
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,799
really inspirational that we can go from

578
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,200
diagnosis to treatment in 6 months now.

579
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,640
Um really customized base editor for

580
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,039
this patient's mutation.

581
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,120
Um I will also shout out one of my other

582
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,120
colleagues at the NIH Succeed Raven

583
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
who's leading many clinical trials using

584
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,360
these engineered crisper cast proteins

585
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,080
for base editing for inborn errors of

586
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,360
immunity. um three different ongoing

587
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,840
trials for different flavors of primary

588
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,760
immune deficiencies. Um two have already

589
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,799
enrolled patients and showing promise

590
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,120
and others uh recently dosed. So I think

591
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,600
here again just highlighting the really

592
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,679
immense potential of uh pairing base

593
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,400
editors with these customized crisper

594
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,679
cast proteins uh to get medicines into

595
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,039
patients that we know should be

596
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,280
beneficial because essentially we're

597
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,840
just converting back to a wild type

598
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,520
genome and doing our best as we can to

599
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,200
avoid offtarget edits.

600
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,000
I have no idea. Do I have five more

601
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,280
minutes? Five more minutes. Okay. So I

602
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,720
think to to frame where we've come um

603
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,480
you know we have now this really

604
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
tremendous toolbox of crispercast

605
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,520
proteins that allow us to think about

606
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,000
going from diagnosis to treatment in a

607
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,200
matter of months. Um we'd like to do

608
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,039
this quicker, right? So 6 months is okay

609
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,360
for some diseases, but for others it's

610
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,919
still really not fast enough. So how do

611
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,320
we think about even accelerating this

612
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,400
timeline even quicker?

613
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,640
So uh here for most rare diseases one of

614
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,520
the problems is that many patients

615
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,159
present with different genetic mutations

616
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,159
um very rare where there's an enriched

617
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,720
mutation that every individual would

618
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,320
have like in cle cell disease. So um

619
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,440
this is usually the situation where

620
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,320
we've found that uh we can diagnose

621
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,320
identify and develop a a base editor and

622
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,960
a guide RNA for a few mutations in a

623
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,480
gene. But to do this for tens or

624
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,280
hundreds or thousands of different

625
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,280
patients for the same disease, there are

626
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,720
many different potential challenges here

627
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,480
for scale. Um some of which are

628
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,799
scientific, some of which are

629
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,440
regulatory. I think all of these aspects

630
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,559
are being solved right now. Um, some of

631
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
the bigger challenges just are

632
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,480
financial. It still costs millions of

633
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,799
dollars and months of time to develop

634
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,120
these bespoke base editing treatments

635
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,240
for different patients. So, how do we

636
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,880
think about solving some of these

637
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,039
problems? In my lab, we're working on

638
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,200
methods to make this process quicker

639
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,679
where we can now make as much of this

640
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,159
predictable as possible. Um, where we

641
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,480
can have a set of off-the-shelf base

642
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,480
editors and predict which guide RNA one

643
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,320
would use to go and treat that genetic

644
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,200
mutation.

645
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,799
U but another approach would be to think

646
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
of different ways of editing. So instead

647
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,559
of going to correct individual

648
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,200
mutations, can we develop technologies

649
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,760
where we would insert specific cDNAs

650
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,080
that would correct these mutations at

651
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,080
the endogenous locus for an an

652
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,240
individual gene? And if we could develop

653
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,600
these types of pan mutation editors, we

654
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,000
could treat all patients within a

655
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,520
disease class uh with one editing

656
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,400
modality. So this would be widely

657
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,200
applicable across lots of patients.

658
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Um, so there have been lots of ways that

659
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
have been proposed in the terms of

660
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,120
genome editing technologies to do this

661
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,080
and two of the major enzymes that would

662
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,520
allow us to insert DNA into the genome

663
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,440
are called recombinases and transposees.

664
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,279
Um, for the sake of time I'll just do

665
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,520
this pretty quickly and saying that both

666
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,679
of these types these classes of enzymes

667
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,360
require double stranded DNA donors and

668
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,000
this is just how they evolved in nature.

669
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,919
they uh by necessity have to utilize

670
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,279
double stranded DNA as a donor to insert

671
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,600
that cargo into the genome. Uh but this

672
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,919
creates an issue. So most primary human

673
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
cell types in mice and humans don't like

674
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,760
double stranded DNA. This triggers our

675
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,919
innate immune response uh usually

676
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,440
leading to cell death depending on the

677
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,880
cell type that you're working in. Um so

678
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,120
showing this differently in an

679
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,000
experiment in neonatal mice if you

680
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,840
inject PBS they're perfectly happy. Um

681
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
if we inject double stranded DNA at

682
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,600
different doses into mice, we see this

683
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,240
really profound activation of sting,

684
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,080
phosphorolated sting uh because seagass

685
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,520
will recognize double stranded DNA and

686
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,440
initiate this uh interferon cascade.

687
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,480
Um in adult mice, this is even more

688
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,600
profound where um in untreated or in PBS

689
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,600
treated mice, there's obviously no

690
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,360
activation of sting. Uh but in double

691
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,679
stranded DNA treated mice, we see this

692
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,200
really uh essentially every hippatocite

693
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,200
in the liver will light up. Um and this

694
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,200
of course leads to pretty rapid cell

695
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,760
death uh and animal death in mice. Uh so

696
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,000
because all of these promising platforms

697
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,080
for large sequence integration require

698
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,080
double stranded DNA donors, this issue

699
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,840
of innate immunity essentially rules out

700
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,520
all of these enzymes for large sequence

701
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,000
insertion because they all require

702
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,840
double stranded DNA donors. So we

703
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,919
wondered if we could get away from this

704
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,799
type of donor format so that we could

705
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,120
think about large sequence insertion for

706
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,320
therapeutic purposes. So double stranded

707
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,000
DNA is seagassp provoking. Uh we know uh

708
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,919
based on recent evidence in the field

709
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,240
that circular singlestranded DNA is

710
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,640
immunasive. It's not detectable by

711
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,640
seagass. Got one minute I can do this.

712
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,240
Um it's not detectable by seagass

713
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,799
because there's no double stranded

714
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,799
portion. Um the problem here though is

715
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,720
that this now is not functional with re

716
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,919
combinases because we've removed the

717
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,000
doublest stranded DNA um substrate.

718
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,799
So we wondered could we make only a

719
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,799
small region of this DNA donor

720
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,799
doublestranded um such that the

721
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,279
reaccombase could still recognize it but

722
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,720
now the vast majority of this donor DNA

723
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,400
molecule remains evasive to seagass. Um

724
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,400
so this would be immune evasive as a

725
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,000
molecule but still recognizable by

726
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,760
recombinases.

727
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,799
So there's a lot of data that underlies

728
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,320
this, but I'll just show you the the

729
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,000
take-home message here is that when we

730
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,679
use the doublest stranded DNA like I

731
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,080
showed you a few slides ago, we see this

732
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,760
really profound activation of sting. But

733
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,840
when we use this chimeic molecule with

734
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,240
only a short double stranded region,

735
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,919
this remains immune stealth. We don't

736
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,559
activate um seagass or sting.

737
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,320
So we've gone on to show that this u

738
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,760
different type of DNA donor format is

739
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,440
actually functional with all different

740
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,080
types of large sequence insertion

741
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,760
technologies. uh we've done this in lots

742
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,200
of different cultured human cell types.

743
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,559
We've done this in primary human cells

744
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,520
and also now in vivo in mice.

745
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,559
Um so this gives us a lot of optimism

746
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,000
about large sequence insertion as pan

747
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,720
mutation editing approaches moving

748
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,520
forward because we now have an a DNA

749
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,880
donor format type that is able to evade

750
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,799
immune detection. Um, these types of

751
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,720
donors are compatible with all of our

752
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,039
favorite types of enzymes that we use to

753
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,039
insert large sequences into the genome.

754
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,480
And this now, I think, removes one of

755
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,880
the major barriers that was really

756
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,559
prohibiting the uh these pan mutation

757
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,799
editing approaches from being functional

758
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,320
in vivo or in most primary human cell

759
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,159
types.

760
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,919
Um, so this work was actually led by

761
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,360
Connor, a graduate student in the time

762
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,360
at the lab, who's now just temporarily

763
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
doing a short posttock. Um, Joe and

764
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,440
Devid and many others in the group have

765
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,360
played a key role. um other folks at

766
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,080
Full Circle Therapeutics and other labs

767
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,240
at MGH and at um MGB who played really

768
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,559
key roles in the the invivo aspects of

769
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,360
this work as well.

770
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,960
So to summarize, I think we've come

771
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:04,080
really far in the last decade uh from

772
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,919
being able to diagnose mutations uh to

773
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,840
now being able to develop these really

774
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,480
rapid customizable treatments for

775
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,159
patients in a matter of months. Uh I'm

776
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,080
extremely optimistic that we can really

777
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,120
compress those timelines even further

778
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,520
given that the FDA has signaled a lot of

779
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,080
interest in in playing an active role in

780
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,520
in how they change their regulatory

781
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,399
mindset and getting these treatments

782
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,640
into patients quicker as well. Um,

783
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,080
beyond the mutation specific editing, I

784
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,760
showed you how we've thought about

785
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,919
removing one of the key barriers for

786
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,600
large sequence insertion that will all

787
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,600
also now allow us to think about these

788
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,600
pan mutation editing approaches where we

789
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,559
could develop one editing treatment for

790
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,799
all patients in a a class of genetic

791
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,200
disease. So with that, I'll I'll show a

792
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,200
cartoon of the lab and again just really

793
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,559
grateful for their efforts and very

794
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,159
thankful for all the funders that have

795
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,200
enabled us to do this work. Thank you

796
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,200
for letting me tell you something

797
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,200
different.

798
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,720
Incredible work. Few questions. One or

799
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,720
two

800
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
>> here.

801
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,960
>> That was a that was a really amazing

802
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,360
talk as as someone whose partner has a

803
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,720
rare rare disease that is uh not really

804
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,480
on the

805
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,000
>> uh not really in any clinical trials

806
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,640
right now. It's just it's really cool to

807
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,080
hear something hopeful. Um, in terms of

808
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,320
the part at the end where you're talking

809
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,559
about using a, you know, partially DSDNA

810
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,600
as a payload, how big of a do you have,

811
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,600
and I don't know if you have a sense of

812
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,000
this, but how big of a thing could you

813
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,440
potentially replace like an Exxon or

814
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,320
like do you have a sense of the payload

815
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,360
size?

816
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,080
>> Yeah, so we've tested cDNA anywhere from

817
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,120
2 KB or 1 KB on the lower end up to 6 or

818
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,000
7 KB. Uh, recombinases are actually

819
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,039
really agnostic in most senses of in the

820
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,799
cargo that they insert. So they're not

821
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,399
like some technologies where the bigger

822
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,320
you make the cargo like homology

823
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,159
directed repair with crisper cast

824
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,399
nucleases where the the size of

825
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,799
insertion makes the efficiency lower.

826
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,120
They're generally agnostic of the the

827
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,399
cargo size up to a certain point. And I

828
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,159
think there it just becomes a matter of

829
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,520
delivering the the donor into cells that

830
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,600
becomes the bottleneck rather than the

831
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,840
enzyme itself. So um I think most cDNAs

832
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,000
are under 5 kb. I think it's like 90% of

833
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,600
cDNAs of genes are under five kilobases

834
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,679
and that's well within the remmit of

835
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,919
these types of approaches.

836
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,600
>> So So just to kind of continue then I'll

837
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,200
hand it to someone else but you'd be

838
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,080
thinking about so you'd be thinking

839
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,360
about dropping in a a a full cDNA

840
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,159
directly or would you be thinking about

841
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,840
like replacing an exxon that is you know

842
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,760
the exxon in question that has like a

843
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,679
missense or nonsense mutation just

844
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,440
trying to get a feel for method there.

845
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,440
>> Yeah. So, so here I think if you're

846
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,559
using something like a recombinase and

847
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,360
you're trying to insert at the

848
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,919
endogenous locus, the ideal strategy

849
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,000
would be to insert the full cDNA and in

850
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,919
some cases maybe an intron if needed for

851
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,320
the correct expression of a gene and

852
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,000
then having a a polya sequence. So you

853
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,919
basically turn off the native gene

854
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,760
downstream and you'd only express the

855
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,519
corrective cDNA and by doing this at the

856
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,600
endogenous locus you'd express it at the

857
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,000
the normal levels.

858
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,159
>> Thank you very much.

859
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,159
>> All right, last question. Go ahead,

860
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,240
Molina. Last question for you.

861
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,360
>> What? Very quick. I mean, breakthrough

862
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,440
work. It's really phenomenal to um hear

863
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,799
it over and over again. I love it. I

864
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,519
have one question. Actually, I might

865
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,080
have missed that part. Is your model to

866
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,120
design picking up or predicting

867
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,840
bystander effects of the editors?

868
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,559
>> Yeah. So, uh I don't know if there's

869
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,000
great models yet. So, Manda Arbab here

870
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,120
did her PhD with David Lou. they

871
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,039
developed a um a prediction method

872
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,039
called behive and that helps you

873
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,480
nominate guide RNAs that one could use

874
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,880
but um I think there's no great

875
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,799
consensus I think it's sort of trial by

876
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,080
you know try and see what you get and

877
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,799
what we've learned actually for a lot of

878
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,279
the primary deficiencies is that um we

879
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,880
have good cell models to test the impact

880
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,399
of a bystander edit because it shouldn't

881
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,840
be that if you have a bystander you

882
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,000
can't use this clinically I think we

883
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,600
have to learn what the impact is and in

884
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
some cases actually the bystander edit

885
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,559
has been beneficial. We don't know

886
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
whether that's because it's changing the

887
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,320
function of the protein or it's changing

888
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,760
expression of the protein, but I think

889
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,320
this is something the field will learn a

890
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,000
lot more about as we get more of these

891
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,000
um approaches into the clinic.

892
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
>> Awesome.
