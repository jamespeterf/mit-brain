1
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,680
good morning everyone uh welcome to Nano

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,320
exploration webinar this is our first

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,559
webinar of this year and uh today it's

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,800
my great pleasure to host uh Dr Zack

5
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:50,079
hwen uh from our group to talk about

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:55,000
present his research and uh Zach uh um

7
00:00:50,079 --> 00:01:00,239
joined our group in 200 uh uh

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,119
2023 and uh um he received his PhD uh in

9
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:08,280
2019 uh from uh North Eastern University

10
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:12,439
and um he also did a post

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,720
do at a uh nebal research lab before he

12
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:18,840
uh comes here and it is such a wonderful

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:24,159
pleasure to work with Zach uh he uh is

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,479
so uh uh energetic and uh motivated and

15
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,920
his uh enthusiasm is so contagious and

16
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,920
uh he's such a a great leader and man

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,200
Mentor uh in the group and also connect

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,119
us with a lot of collaborators uh to ciz

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,439
our materials I'm so thankful to work

20
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,479
with deck and um yeah I hope you enjoy

21
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,360
uh his talk today and uh before we uh

22
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:53,159
start a z seminar uh I would like to

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,159
mention some uh um housekeeping uh uh

24
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,960
things uh in uh if you have a question

25
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,320
during the seminar uh please uh you can

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,479
write it in the chat or uh you can wait

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,239
until um uh after the seminar the Q&A

28
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,440
time uh you can read your virtual hand

29
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,040
and we can uh ask the question there um

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,280
I think with that I will uh give the

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,599
time to

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,040
Zach thank you

33
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,200
Zach awesome um Okay cool so I guess

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,120
people can see me um hopefully see the

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,760
research so thank you Jing for the

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,440
introduction that's very kind and thank

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,560
you so much MIT

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,000
for giving me the opportunity to present

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,519
the work so this work it is a

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,640
conglomeration it's really a combination

41
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,000
of many bushels of people coming

42
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,159
together each solving a unique and

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,879
complex challenge to make it possible so

44
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,280
this is um extraordinary

45
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,760
interdisciplinary I don't know how it

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
would have come together without the

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,680
help of so many people um so 2D

48
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,800
materials let's Dive Right In um 2D

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,400
materials they are sort of surprising

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,280
and they continue to surprise actually

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,159
for decades for decades people predicted

52
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,480
2D materials could not exist in the Free

53
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,319
State they would need a special

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,720
environment but it surprised everyone in

55
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,879
2004 when they started to come on the

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,799
scene and they continue to surprise in

57
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,920
part because I believe once you stack

58
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,760
them so one 2D material stacked on

59
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,680
another that they um will then form new

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,319
properties and this formation happens

61
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,239
because where the 2D materials overlap

62
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,319
their crystals have an effective

63
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,519
multiplication and they form this Moray

64
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,519
pattern you can see this Moray pattern

65
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,360
this Moray pattern is a new crystal

66
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,959
lattice and as we twist the materials

67
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,159
does it

68
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:46,159
um um oh is it working or I don't see

69
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,720
the slides

70
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,040
moving um oh oh sorry I was uh there we

71
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,680
go perfect now we got it but as you as

72
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,079
it twists um you can see new Moray

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:03,120
patterns form and so new lates and this

74
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:05,360
is um you know how can a lattice make

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,560
such a difference well think of diamond

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,360
versus graphite both are chemically

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,360
identical both only have carbon yet they

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,599
have different lates and they have

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,079
dramatically different properties and

80
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,280
the same thing sort of happens with the

81
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,560
2D materials when we stack them when we

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,639
twist them we can sus out very

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,360
surprising

84
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,479
properties um so as a quick so I can

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,479
prime my audience um stacking involves

86
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,600
bringing a stamp to the surface and then

87
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,039
when it's released it can pick a

88
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,600
material up and then you can stack the

89
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,280
materials one on each other Okay cool so

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,039
think that in your mind so now going on

91
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,759
I'm going to give a quick background of

92
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,600
some of my favorite uh works that show

93
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,199
really the impact of this field so the

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,600
first one this is a classic right this

95
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,560
is a classic magic angle graphing back

96
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,440
in 2018 it bursts on the scene and

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,240
everyone was excited it blew the world

98
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,320
away actually you can still find the aps

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,759
American physical Society talk on

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,080
YouTube by Professor Yar herero and um

101
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,320
it's like a standing room only packed

102
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,600
room and um they display other places in

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
the conference room but it's sort of

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,400
simple you know they took two graphine

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,000
sheets I mean it wasn't simple at the

106
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,960
time and it's still not simple but in uh

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,280
conceptually it's two graphine sheets

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,520
Twisted to a magic angle roughly you

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,759
know 1.1 and you then can get

110
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,520
superconducting activity and you can

111
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,919
even gate it so change your carrier

112
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,080
density and go from M insulator back to

113
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,160
superconductor and this is a stunning

114
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,919
result right so you can stack these 2D

115
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,680
materials and now you can get super

116
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,840
conductivity out all right let's talk

117
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,479
about the next one let me start my timer

118
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,720
Jing I'm just starting my timer so let

119
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,319
me know if I go over um and so um yeah

120
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,319
2D magnetics people also weren't sure if

121
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,360
a magnet could exist within 2D materials

122
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,639
but they did find one it's chromium I3

123
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,080
and it monolayer it's pherom magnetic

124
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,880
then if you have by layer pristine so

125
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,319
the stacking order is perfect I believe

126
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,360
then you get antier magn but if you

127
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,759
twist those two layers you get do

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,280
domains of pherom magnetic and domains

129
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,240
of antiferromagnetic so we can see as we

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,960
stack materials we can get not just

131
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,680
different super connectivity but we can

132
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,520
also get um unique uh magnet magnetic

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,560
behavior all right let's move on um

134
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,240
bisco Twisted bisco so this work is done

135
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,440
by Dr Frank Xiao he's at MIT but now but

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,960
uh was previously at Harvard and

137
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,800
Professor Philip Kim's group and they

138
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,520
took bisco which is a well-known uh

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,080
cprit um superconductor and they twist

140
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,639
it to different angles zero 31 degrees

141
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,479
you know nearly 45 degrees and they

142
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,520
found out at 45 degrees they got this

143
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,560
like really stunning result they also

144
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,479
found they could make a jome diode

145
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,360
without a magnetic field pretty pretty

146
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,240
stunning and they got these fractional

147
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,599
Shapiro steps and so this seemingly well

148
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,680
understood material simply Twisted

149
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,240
produced a very unexpected or a pretty

150
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,360
amazing result um okay now we're going

151
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,599
to move on sliding ferel electric so

152
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,280
these are quick updates on the amazing

153
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,479
stuff that the stacking can do and it's

154
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,400
all sort of in the recent history um

155
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,479
sliding Fair electrics you can take

156
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,759
certain two-dimensional materials and

157
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,440
you stack them in the AA configuration

158
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,560
and nothing really happens but if you go

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,039
to the ab stack configuration the ba you

160
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,400
can get electric fields that form within

161
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,240
the material depending on the direction

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,879
and and what's neat about this is now

163
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,520
let's stack it let's put graphine with

164
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,960
two hbn sheets and now we have an hbn as

165
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,360
an insulator now we can gate it so we're

166
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,240
going to apply voltage we have electric

167
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,080
field going through here and as you

168
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,599
apply an electric field you switch

169
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,159
between ba and ab and very very cleverly

170
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,319
this graphing right here acts as a

171
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,280
sensor so we're going to look at some

172
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,240
data right here and you can see the

173
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,479
graphing resistance and you can see two

174
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,199
states two very distinct States you can

175
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,720
almost write one as the onate

176
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,720
you know or off State so zero and one

177
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,479
and they actually then showed it has

178
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,800
some uh major implications for advanced

179
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:12,680
Computing I think it was um insanely

180
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,080
fast switching speeds like nanc uh you

181
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,360
know equipment limitations that allow

182
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,560
him to go to check even faster and they

183
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,520
also um like 10 to the 11 or something

184
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,639
like that um uh switching cycles and it

185
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,159
still had some pretty good performance

186
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,039
um so I encourage everyone to read that

187
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,680
paper it's pretty recent but it's a a

188
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,120
stunning finding and very application

189
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,680
for industry friendly um okay so we just

190
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,240
talked about super connectivity then we

191
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,200
talked about magnetism a Jose diode

192
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,719
without magic field and then sliding fer

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,120
electrics um the next stuff so all the

194
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,279
previous stuff was stacked um in this

195
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,760
case just so my previous research from

196
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,279
Naval research laboratory but I grew

197
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,920
bismo selenide on top of different

198
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,200
transition metal dialon aide monolayers

199
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,760
so TMD monolayers and bisma selenide is

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,040
known for being a topological insulator

201
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,760
and it has these spin protected States

202
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,320
so it uh you know thinks spintronics and

203
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,560
advanced and very very low power

204
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,640
Computing and then the tmds they have a

205
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
strong light matter interaction among

206
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,600
many other properties and so the idea is

207
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,920
can you couple them together and we we

208
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,279
found sort of like two um two exciting

209
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,839
results so this one this result here is

210
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,760
a bound Exon phonon quasi particle um

211
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,279
which are rare quasi particles but it's

212
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Unique is it's across the inter layer

213
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,519
region and then on the other side uh

214
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,600
this work was done at nor Eastern when I

215
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,600
was a graduate student but we found uh

216
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,640
some indications of a possible

217
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,880
electronic purely electronic lattice at

218
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,360
the interface and I believe other 2D

219
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,519
materials have also found some

220
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,839
indications um so it shows as you

221
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,920
combine the materials in this case

222
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:55,000
growing them we can get some unexpected

223
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,800
results um okay finally um so uh I

224
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,959
combined an oxygen transport membrane on

225
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,839
top of 2D materials so oxygen transport

226
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,040
membranes they're very simple they

227
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,640
here's a membrane you have a mixed gas

228
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,320
on one side and it only allows oxygen to

229
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,360
pass through so the oxygen molecule will

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,519
break up at the surface pass through as

231
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,959
atoms and then recombine on the other

232
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,720
side and this allows you to make fuel

233
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,000
cells so think clean energy think

234
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,120
hydrogen economy a lot of promise right

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,040
there but in this case we combined it on

236
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,959
2D materials and what we can do is we

237
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,880
can stuff oxygen into this interlayer

238
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,360
region

239
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,839
and within the actual oxygen transport

240
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,920
membrane and we can intercalate it and

241
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:40,240
also deintercalate and through this

242
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,120
process we can modify the 2D materials

243
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,279
properties so I did it once again with

244
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,680
these transition metal like calcog these

245
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,560
tmds which have a strong light matter

246
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,920
interaction and I could modify the

247
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,639
photoluminescence with high Precision

248
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,480
this using a laser and we can do it with

249
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:02,360
high spatial precis too so I tried to

250
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,880
write NRL so go Navy NRL right there um

251
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,720
and how high can we make the Precision

252
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,240
so each data point you see in this curve

253
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,720
and there are hundreds um is actually

254
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,320
one whole Spectra we extracted it using

255
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,720
fitting so the air bars are pretty low

256
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,399
so this is the Bal inessence intensity

257
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,240
going up in air in oxygen and then it's

258
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,480
going back down in vacuum as we de

259
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,000
intercalate and it's going back up in

260
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,000
air and you can see we can go up and

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,480
down um by intercalating and de

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,279
intercalating and we can do it with

263
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,160
really high Precision so this shows that

264
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,079
we have um if you combine oxygen

265
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,720
transport membranes we grew it in this

266
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,880
case but you could stack them um you can

267
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,360
then really modify with high Precision

268
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,079
your 2D materials so okay so we have

269
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,240
shown I believe some pretty cool stuff

270
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,000
right here you know we have some super

271
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,200
connectivity magnetism um ajose some

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,200
diode and some fer electrics as well as

273
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,279
Exon phoneon bound State a pure possible

274
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,160
pure charge 2D Crystal and also this

275
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:06,040
precision tunability and so stacking is

276
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,800
pretty cool but there's some issues here

277
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,360
you see these amazing results over here

278
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,120
were done uh using exfoliate primary

279
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,320
exfoliate materials which is not super

280
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,279
duper industry friendly they're not like

281
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,519
uh they're not crazy about it and then

282
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,519
um in this case I grew bisma saline top

283
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,920
and that was labor intensive labor time

284
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,440
intensive so industry likes it but again

285
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,199
from a research perspective it's labor

286
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,320
and time intensive and it doesn't work

287
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:34,880
for every material maybe I can grow on

288
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,240
the tmds but can I grow on graphine can

289
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,480
I grow on hexagonal Boron nitrite or a

290
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,440
random one someone would like to try out

291
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,519
so this begs the question can we go

292
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,160
beyond exfoliate can we make these

293
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,199
results with non-exfoliated materials

294
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,639
and can we stack nearly any material

295
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:57,079
well let me tell you about a hero of

296
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,360
mine Professor Andrew manx who did have

297
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,279
this dream and did try to go beyond and

298
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,040
they made this very novel polymer stamp

299
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,800
design then they built this exciting

300
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,320
machine right here it's all in vacuum

301
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,079
has a nice turbo pump and it's all

302
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,120
automated and they were able to pick up

303
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,959
and stack Mo cvd materials and what's

304
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,079
excited about that isvd metal oxide

305
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,399
chemical vapor deposition is very

306
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,519
industry-friendly so here you have tsmc

307
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,560
saying well that's cool and then they

308
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,839
also stacked from The Grow substrate so

309
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,880
no prior treatment needed that's again

310
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,000
tsmc is saying well that's cool and he

311
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,440
also showed it can run very fast so uh

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,600
30 layers per hour which is insane

313
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,440
compared to many exfoliated efforts and

314
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,800
stacked um 80 layers uh pretty rapidly

315
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,760
which is also an insane number of um

316
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,079
layers to stack right all

317
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,920
monolayer or you know near two but I

318
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:56,279
think monolayer and um and so what about

319
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,160
the results well this Atomic

320
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,600
reconstruction of the tmds I believe is

321
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,560
understated result is incredible so you

322
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,480
have all these extra spots here so this

323
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,720
is a defraction pattern electrons are

324
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,800
diffracting off but you have all these

325
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,800
like tiny little spots and those are

326
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,720
because the electrons are diffracting

327
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,399
off of the atoms moving so his interface

328
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,560
cleanliness and quality was so good that

329
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,560
the atoms readjust themselves to form

330
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,399
these more stable Moray patterns and

331
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,720
then the electrons defract over those

332
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,680
new moay

333
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,040
patterns um same wise the Precision of

334
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,880
the setup was impressive as well and you

335
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,000
can see through these um STM images I

336
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,680
guess but cross-sectional that it's a

337
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,240
very clean interface so 30 layers per

338
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,160
hour uh 80 layers very clean um again

339
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,560
our hero and so we said can we do this

340
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,800
as well but can we do it also for more

341
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,839
materials um so this is sort of where

342
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,920
the top comes in we have our setup right

343
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,680
here um there's the chamber we have our

344
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,880
camera we have a pressure gauge we do

345
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,079
things a little different we put in

346
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,560
argon atmosphere and we don't use a

347
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,800
turbo pump we use a roughing pump so we

348
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,800
only go to like 70 milor um but we

349
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,199
hopefully the Argon atmosphere gives a

350
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,600
level of cleanliness um we also have two

351
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,920
heaters a stamp heater and a stage

352
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,759
heater so both sides um and let's see

353
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
what we can oh I guess I can tell you a

354
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,959
little bit more at the machines yeah so

355
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,040
stamp pater is up here um and everything

356
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,959
is for the most part like homebuilt uh

357
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,720
wouldn't have been possible without all

358
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,519
the labmates in my team providing ideas

359
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,800
along the way I could point to any

360
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,480
little part of the machine and say this

361
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,600
person help with this this person's idea

362
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,759
was this um so very appreciative and

363
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,920
even small conversations in the hallway

364
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,560
where someone said oh you could try

365
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,759
heating it and that was the thing that

366
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,959
made it work you know it wouldn't have

367
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,360
worked otherwise um and so we one thing

368
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,639
we do is we repeated Professor mx's uh

369
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,040
stamp design um we don't have four

370
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,000
layers we don't have three but we're

371
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,240
working on getting a fourth layer there

372
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,399
and um we don't have quite the same uh

373
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
you know Precision some other stuff but

374
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,000
we are able to stack uh more material so

375
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
we're happy with the progress in that

376
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,480
area but we're working on making a

377
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,959
cleaner interface um cool cool so this

378
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,079
is the machine we have let's see what it

379
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,199
can do oh actually before we tell you

380
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,800
about the machine let me tell you about

381
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,600
these Shipmates that I work with this

382
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,600
incredible group um so this group I work

383
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,199
with they grow an absolutely insane

384
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,079
number of materials in the group so um

385
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,680
the group that Jing leads so we have a

386
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:33,440
single Crystal graphine um it's grown on

387
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,319
these like single Crystal copper foils

388
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,560
um and so um so the graphine is single

389
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:40,680
Crystal for these giant domains um we

390
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,399
also make nanoporous graphine which is

391
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,880
very exciting for filtering um very

392
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:46,880
exciting papers published maybe I think

393
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,480
about a year ago um here are all the

394
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,759
various tmds that are grown within the

395
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,079
group um we hexagonal boron nitride we

396
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,639
grow monolayer and very thin but we also

397
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,519
grow thicker 3 to 20 nmet again this is

398
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,639
all for very large area growth carbon

399
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,120
nanot tubes oh Janice material this is

400
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,360
one of my uh my my fades in the group so

401
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,959
we can take these tmds and convert this

402
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,959
some Janis so you make the top layer a

403
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,959
different calogen atom and that creates

404
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,120
an intrinsic dipole and these are um

405
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,799
they have a lot of Promise they have a

406
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,799
lot of Promise um so cool cool so we

407
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,360
grow all these interesting materials and

408
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,439
how is the group so productive well one

409
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,160
of the group members uh Dr Juna Wong um

410
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,840
brilliant researcher he actually made

411
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,760
some software and connected it some

412
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,200
hardware and things are automating the

413
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,600
lab so you can see here the fans are

414
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,679
starting up and that's how the furnaces

415
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,760
are cooled but the lids also open

416
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,200
themselves and close themselves and the

417
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,400
gas flow rates are also um automated so

418
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,320
because the whole process is automated I

419
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,600
believe has led to a significant

420
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,440
increase in productivity and efficiency

421
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,320
um also the growths are in my opinion

422
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,280
more repeatable so if I were to start a

423
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,679
lab I'm going to use lab o that's what I

424
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,600
say

425
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,960
um and so cool cool okay so we have all

426
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,840
these different materials uh which

427
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,159
materials have we stacked so up until

428
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,159
now I've been able to stack single

429
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:15,720
Crystal graphine mc2 mos2 wc2 WS2 naob

430
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,640
diselenide actually technically I guess

431
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,760
it was oxidized at the time um but it

432
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,159
used to be nide hexagonal Bor nitri

433
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,280
different layers um mos2 from the MOs

434
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,280
cvd front mos2 and a Janice variation of

435
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,200
mos2

436
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,919
mon fery networks and exfoliate

437
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,760
materials so so far even though we need

438
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,840
to improve our cleanliness we need to

439
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,679
improve our stamps and improve our

440
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,280
Precision we are able to pick up these

441
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,720
materials and we're hoping to iron out

442
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,919
some of the cleanliness and other things

443
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,720
and start uh churning out results and

444
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,080
churning out headro structures and

445
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,559
hopefully collaborate with people who

446
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,640
can do some of the

447
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,320
characterization um let me quickly show

448
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,120
you guys um stamping what it looks like

449
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,280
from the camera viewpoint and it will

450
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,559
make some of the images more clear later

451
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,280
um or the explanations so here's the

452
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,919
stamp this round thing we're looking

453
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
through the stamps so the stamps are

454
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,039
translucent made out of translucent

455
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,039
polymers and here's some nice gold

456
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,679
that's been deposited on an si2 surface

457
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,159
and then I I treated it um to get it to

458
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,720
release a little bit but the gold was

459
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,960
generously given by Peter S I can't

460
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,280
pronounce the last names but he's in

461
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,799
freser Far group great person encourage

462
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,960
you to reach out to him and um so here's

463
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,120
a stamp before it makes a contact with

464
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,840
the surface then it makes contact and

465
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,280
you can see um that there's a color

466
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,000
change it's due to the thin film effect

467
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,760
so we in contact the the polymer makes a

468
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,720
color change and then I picked it up and

469
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
you can see the gold picked up from the

470
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,640
surface and so that's how the stamping

471
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,360
process works we align things we make

472
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,679
contact and we pick up and we see if it

473
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,840
picked up okay cool cool so I showed you

474
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,720
guys earlier we have this machine it can

475
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,320
pick up the 2D materials here's a stamp

476
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,000
it's cut into a square by hand but it

477
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,559
only makes contact where these pillars

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,559
are that are fabricated using a mold and

479
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,280
I'll explain it all

480
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,679
later um and then let me show you so

481
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,520
this is real time this movie so here

482
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,480
we're going to be picking up different

483
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,480
graphing sheets um and um you'll see it

484
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,200
goes into contact so now it's in contact

485
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,520
right there so it will only pick up

486
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,000
graphine right there now we just lifted

487
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,760
up the graphine shifting location and

488
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,159
now we're going to go back down and pick

489
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,480
up a second layer and so this is all

490
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,520
done real time and this is the speed at

491
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,080
which we can pick up materials um this

492
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,640
was a pretty clean pick up but it could

493
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,400
have been better but if you wait a

494
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,200
little bit longer maybe give it 30

495
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,159
seconds or a minute or two minutes it

496
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,760
can it will become what appears to be a

497
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,480
nearly perfect pickup if not perfect um

498
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,720
cool cool and this is where I've tried

499
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,080
to do some Automation and it worked out

500
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,320
good but it could be better and so here

501
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,840
we're going to make contact with the

502
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,159
surface and I've automated it by by

503
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,679
simply telling the motors to go certain

504
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,080
distances down and up this is in

505
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,360
contrast to Professor mx's research

506
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,960
where there was some Optical detection

507
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,440
to see when the color change would

508
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,200
happen and then that's when the motor

509
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,400
would know when to stop and um so that's

510
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,600
what we would like we would like to go

511
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,159
where Professor manx did in um having uh

512
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,600
an optical detection it will improve the

513
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,159
result we believe but we've gotten

514
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,159
partial automation so far cool cool

515
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,960
um so let's show you a quick snapshot of

516
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:37,000
some of the results so you can see each

517
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,279
of the circles have been uh picked up

518
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,360
and so was 10 layers of graphine picked

519
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,320
up in two and a half minutes this

520
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,679
particular graphine um is grown on a

521
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,760
single Crystal copper foil and the

522
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,279
grains are pretty huge so at least

523
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,240
portions of it I'm sure were uh lined up

524
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,480
or Twisted to the desired twist angle so

525
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,840
hopefully we can repeat some of these

526
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,880
incredible Twisted graphing results um

527
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,600
but use cvd materials and more Stacks um

528
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,440
the next one is I stacked a multi-layer

529
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,360
hbn that we grew from uh Dr kunan CH and

530
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,360
also some monolayer WS2 and some

531
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,880
graphine and this was just to sort of

532
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,039
see how good the interface would look

533
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,480
and test it out um and you can see the

534
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,960
pl is quenched as predicted likely due

535
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,600
to charge transfer into the graphine and

536
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,640
we see all the various Ramen signals

537
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,960
from uh our WS2 our graphine and our HP

538
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,799
end so cool so this is just two quick

539
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,520
snapshots um but I do want to show you

540
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,880
um a more exciting one that we recently

541
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,919
got um so

542
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,159
beforehand so we had to cut our 2D

543
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,679
material into different shapes so we use

544
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,520
this scratch method right here and we

545
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,200
wanted to cut into shapes so we could

546
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,679
have electrodes be more rectangles and

547
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,559
then we could have squares be where the

548
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,400
device would be and stuff like that and

549
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,200
we're trying to reduce the amount of

550
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,600
polymer um um in the process I guess for

551
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,400
starters and then two we noticed that

552
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,279
there was gluing from previous

553
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,760
experience when a polymer was used so

554
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,679
we're trying to prevent this gluing so

555
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,039
we could pick it up from the

556
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,559
substrates um so we have noticed some

557
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,840
issues with this tactic and recently

558
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:22,360
it's not the uh uh save all but it has

559
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,240
worked so far for making some devices um

560
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,480
and so I'm going to show you guys an

561
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,360
mos2 and Janice hetero structure that we

562
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,640
made so to make a and Junction and so

563
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,960
here's a diagram of our stamp and the

564
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,600
stamp will move to the desired location

565
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,919
we'll go down and we'll pick up and so

566
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,240
here's our first pickup and we've just

567
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,960
picked up a strip of MVD mos2 now our

568
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,400
stamp will move to the Janice side I'm

569
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,080
going to overlap it very carefully and I

570
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,320
will pick up the Janice that's the

571
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,039
second pickup right over here you can

572
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,440
see and now we're going to do a third

573
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,120
pickup and so you can see how you can

574
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,880
quickly move between the materials and

575
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,520
deterministically choose where you want

576
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,840
to place your 2D material on the stamp

577
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,880
and then pick everything up and then

578
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,799
drop things off later so let's see how

579
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,240
things worked out so here's step one

580
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,000
here's our mos2 um I'm looking at the

581
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,159
strip this is what I want to pick up I

582
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,360
made contact I picked it up and I don't

583
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,880
know if you can see it but there's a

584
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,919
rectangle here so now I know I picked it

585
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,799
up unfortunately my stamp broke so we

586
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,799
still need to make our stamps more

587
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,039
reliable um but that's the next step um

588
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,640
so we picked up our

589
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,799
mos2 um and now I'm going to go over the

590
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,200
Janice and this is me looking over the

591
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,360
Janice me aligning everything and then I

592
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
made contact and I was able to pick it

593
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,880
up and in the end I was able to stack

594
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:45,720
three stacks of mos2 three stacks of

595
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,559
umvd Mo Janice moss and to the best of

596
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,080
my knowledge picking up Janice materials

597
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,559
is very very challenging and I don't

598
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,559
think very many groups have done this um

599
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,960
we might be we might be the first and so

600
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,880
um so this an exciting heterostructure

601
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,399
we made and I'm working with uh some

602
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,120
students um Morgan from Professor

603
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,919
boros's group who's going to be testing

604
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,200
some of the PN Junction behavior and I'm

605
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,440
hoping to repeat this and make it

606
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,799
cleaner um but nonetheless we're

607
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,600
exciting as a first try and it worked

608
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,559
out pretty quickly um one thing I'll

609
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,480
note the Janice materials they have this

610
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,600
intrinsic di pole and there's a symmetry

611
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,279
breaking so the top layer has been

612
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,840
changed and this symmetry breaking has

613
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:24,039
suggested some uh really nice properties

614
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,760
some incredible properties so we're

615
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,720
hoping to also do this with single

616
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,960
crystals and try them at Different Twist

617
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,039
angles try Optics and devices and

618
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,520
gating um okay cool cool so that's where

619
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,399
we are from stacking we can pick the

620
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,279
materials up but the interface isn't as

621
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:41,120
clean as we would like but at least we

622
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,159
can pick them up um we can pick up a

623
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,760
whole variety of materials and so now

624
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:47,760
we're looking to characterize um in the

625
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,720
meantime I'm doing I'm also working on

626
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,840
some stamp engineering not just to

627
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,559
improve the stamps which I believe will

628
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,360
decrease the amount of polymer out

629
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,640
gassing and improve the interface but

630
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,120
also because we can choose smaller

631
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,760
pickup areas and I believe it's um it

632
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,600
can reduce the number of wrinkles

633
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,799
probably in the final structure so I'm

634
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,000
going to give you a quick overview how

635
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,279
the stamp is created we have this mold

636
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,720
um and it's made using su8 and then we

637
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,279
pour pedms inside um and then you can

638
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,799
pull the pdms out and you can

639
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,520
functionalize the surface and you can

640
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:23,440
spin coat a polymer on top and you bake

641
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,279
it and you repeat it for as many layers

642
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,720
as you want and the top layer is going

643
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,000
to be your active layer that's the

644
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,799
sticky layer that's the one that you

645
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,720
want so pick the different things up and

646
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,360
so what we can do is by changing the

647
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,880
functionalization by changing the

648
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,240
polymer spin coat speed and changing the

649
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,760
um ratio of solvent in the polymer we

650
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,000
can uh make the active area smaller or

651
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,799
larger and you can see it by the

652
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,399
rainbows here so here we have a circle

653
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,640
of an inner circle and sort of these

654
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,919
like outer rainbows so two rainbows

655
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,159
double rainbow and so this inner rainbow

656
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,760
outer rainbow and the inner rainbow is

657
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,480
where the active area is and you can see

658
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,080
from graph it only picked up where the

659
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,960
graphing was and this mistake down here

660
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,760
um so here's a bad stamp there was a

661
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,840
crack that formed and when I spin coded

662
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,880
my final polymer layer on top it Formed

663
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,520
these two bubbles but it was a blessing

664
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,039
in disguise because when we picked it up

665
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,200
we only could pick up where the active

666
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:22,080
layer was and that sort of Hit Upon This

667
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,960
idea that we could um engineer the stamp

668
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,200
um so um this is the team and they are

669
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,799
absolute rock stars I'm going to find a

670
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,840
Growers problem solvers and labmates

671
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:34,360
east of the Mississippi probably more um

672
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,720
and so we're going to work on cleaning

673
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,559
up the interface making a lot of

674
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,399
heterostructures folks are helping us

675
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,960
characterize them we can see how far we

676
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,279
can push it I don't know if it's going

677
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,240
to replace exfoliated definitely not in

678
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,840
the short term but hopefully it moves

679
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,519
the um the community further along and

680
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,640
makes it more industry friendly um and I

681
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,159
think I'm looking at the time I guess

682
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,440
like that probably seems good we have

683
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:01,200
some time for questions um yeah any

684
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,720
questions guess I go to quick yeah thank

685
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,919
you thank you very much Z we have

686
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,919
learned so much during the past year

687
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,399
through de effort now uh it's question

688
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,880
and answers time uh you can put your

689
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:19,360
questions in the chat or uh raise your

690
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,919
hand um vir your hand so the uh now

691
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,279
there is a question uh um yeah maybe let

692
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,360
me read it hi Zach thanks for the great

693
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:32,440
talk how big is the active area of the

694
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,960
stamp and why did you pick the

695
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,760
polymers oh that's

696
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,640
St such a such a good question such a

697
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,799
good question um so the um maybe I can

698
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,679
show it best with this slide so um okay

699
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,880
so for the active

700
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,440
area um okay so

701
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,240
you okay so we have this mold and the

702
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,200
mold will determine how big our p uh

703
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,480
pdms pillar is going to be and that's

704
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,000
going to be sort of our Max size but we

705
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,880
want to keep making the active area

706
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,919
smaller so we want to make our pillars

707
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,440
constantly smaller in diameter however

708
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,159
you know as you can imagine the smaller

709
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,720
you make these molds and then you're

710
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,360
asking this gooey polymer to now fill

711
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,760
the mold and eventually you have to pull

712
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:24,080
it out you literally pull out the pdms

713
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,720
um and this Um this can tear the pillars

714
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,320
If the ratio is incorrect you know um

715
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,039
height to width and the natural thing is

716
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,760
well why don't you just make the pillars

717
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,840
smaller well the smaller you make it the

718
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,600
more it will crash into the surface so

719
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,559
you put your whole pdms thing on your

720
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,760
glass slide and then it only makes

721
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,399
contact where the pillar is but if this

722
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,200
pillar is not tall enough then you might

723
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:53,039
touch at the edges if you're not 100%

724
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,640
flat which is hard to do so there's this

725
00:29:53,039 --> 00:30:00,720
tradeoff where it's challenging to make

726
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,519
the um Kil too skinny um but I think

727
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,120
we've gotten it down to 80 microns um

728
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,519
but we do as large as 2 millimet and

729
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,279
we're trying to you know depending on

730
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,039
the application maybe someone wants

731
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,480
large area transfers and they want many

732
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:17,360
devices in one versus very targeted

733
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,720
where 80 microns might be the diameter

734
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,640
here um also I think the larger the

735
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,960
pillar is the more uh reliable the

736
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,000
pickup can be especially in the center

737
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,840
region so at the edges it sort of can

738
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,440
break down and stuff like that and so so

739
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,480
I guess to answer your question 80

740
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,000
microns is so far the skinniest we've

741
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,240
tried but I believe we get it a little

742
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,240
bit skinnier however I don't think we

743
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,559
get it much based on gut intuition based

744
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,399
on the size of the molds which is why I

745
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,799
believe the active area uh engineering

746
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,880
is um promising because maybe we could

747
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:55,519
engineer something so the drop of active

748
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,159
area is only five or 10 microns and then

749
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,760
we're being uh yeah then we can really

750
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,399
Target things um okay and then the type

751
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,600
of polymers we chose um let's see where

752
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:08,600
do I have my Polymer slides not here so

753
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,279
actually maybe I should go to Ander manx

754
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,600
slide well let's do H okay actually

755
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,159
let's go to Ander manx slide it's better

756
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,519
um oops sorry

757
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:21,159
right um here okay so pdms because it

758
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,039
sticks to glass you can spin things on

759
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:27,399
ad manics has a support layer um we use

760
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:29,320
his um L lift off resist 10 I believe

761
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:32,240
and that was sort of stabilize the stamp

762
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,120
smart idea um I I think it also allows

763
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,760
better spin coating um he also has a

764
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,039
release layer where the polymer breaks

765
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,279
down when heated um and then there's

766
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,480
adhesion layer the adhesion layer is the

767
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,080
really important one so uses a polymer

768
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,080
called pbzma feel free to email I can

769
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,320
give you the exact uh stuff but it um

770
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,279
it's just known for being sort of a

771
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,159
sticky polymer and there's like some um

772
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,519
arguments that can be made of why it's a

773
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,600
good one to pick um but I'm following

774
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,559
Professor mx's research in this case but

775
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,120
pbzma is a good choice and it's spin

776
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,320
coats like you could try using

777
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:11,440
polycarbonate Bisal a PC which is what

778
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,799
almost every um group uses for uh

779
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,720
exfoliated however it doesn't spin coat

780
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,480
it only dissolves in Chlor form it's too

781
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,279
volatile uh whereas the pbzma devolves

782
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,840
in um anyo and so it can spin code so

783
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,200
spin coding which I pointed out one of

784
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,039
the later stuff is the uh trick to doing

785
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,480
the engineering of the stamps um this

786
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080
spin coding so you need something that

787
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,240
spin codes thank you for the question

788
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,880
very good

789
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,639
question yeah thank you very much uh and

790
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,519
then the next question is how do you let

791
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:46,159
go of the monol layer sheet from the

792
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:48,760
stamp is it that uh when the monol layer

793
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,760
is brought close to the substrate it

794
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,240
bonds more strongly to that as compared

795
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,240
to the

796
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,600
step uh okay really good question um so

797
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I would like to make a stamp similar to

798
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,799
Presser manic is where we have this

799
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,000
release layer but um I have't another

800
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,159
time to sort of look into that we've

801
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,039
been doing things in pil however we have

802
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,279
this uh interim solution which has

803
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,399
worked out actually pretty good we

804
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,600
hydroxate the sio2 so uh shout out to my

805
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,480
peeps over in Professor n's group who

806
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,080
really gave me the idea and helped me

807
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,559
along with it but if you

808
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,960
hydroxate um the surface you make the

809
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,399
sio2 very sticky and then the 2D

810
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,320
material just wants to leave and it sort

811
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,360
of pulls off the polymer and then you

812
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,480
rinse the polymer very quickly and it it

813
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,919
seems to produce a clean surface um but

814
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,399
we have to look into that more um so

815
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,159
yeah so I'm sort of trying to engineer

816
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,919
different surfaces so I drop off

817
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,200
currently by functionalizing the S2 and

818
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,039
making it very sticky and then it pulls

819
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,919
off um and that's reliable but I don't

820
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,440
have to do that but that's a very very

821
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,559
reliable

822
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,200
method oh um yeah thank you thank you

823
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,639
very much and the next question is uh uh

824
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,120
from Professor Pao Herrero Herrero thank

825
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:08,200
you for the nice talk Zach Have You

826
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,200
cized by AFM your twisty structures how

827
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,800
uniform is the twist

828
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,159
angle oh such a great it's an honor

829
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,159
Professor um to have you ask me a

830
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,000
question I remember seeing you down the

831
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,919
hallway I first came to MIT and I only

832
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,359
recognized you from your talks online so

833
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,040
you felt like a rock star I was like too

834
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,679
shy to even say anything but um anyways

835
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,960
um that's a very good question negative

836
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
we have not but it's like on the work

837
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,040
list that we're trying to do and I know

838
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,720
your group is actually um in many ways

839
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,040
leading uh that uh you know the efforts

840
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,839
to how to characterize these Mor

841
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,280
patterns and so we're actually trying to

842
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,560
follow in your group's lead and I've

843
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,839
been reaching out casually to get advice

844
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,320
on different stuff but it's we

845
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,960
definitely want to make a stack and

846
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,879
start the characterization um to see how

847
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,320
even things are thank you good

848
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,760
question yeah thank you very much and

849
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,280
the next one is uh thank you so much

850
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,960
Zach for the Fantastic talk I uh sorry

851
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,359
I'm not reading everyone's names I'm

852
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,920
sorry I might have missed it during your

853
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:08,880
talk but how did you exactly align the m

854
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,960
to and jice had her structures was it

855
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,760
act

856
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,560
optically yeah affirmative everything is

857
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,480
is just optically um and so yeah I I

858
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,440
literally just sort of like looked uh

859
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,320
over top how it how it looks um

860
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,160
affirmative I will say um so shout out

861
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,920
to Eden in our group who has made

862
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,880
software that can do twist angle

863
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,440
detection so it's all sort of um using

864
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,599
image recognition to sort of see how

865
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,400
we've much we've Twisted the substrate

866
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:41,560
and that does allow us to cut down on

867
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,000
costs because we don't have to get um a

868
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,240
calibrated um I guess rotational stage

869
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,200
um but with that in mind um we're hoping

870
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,480
in the future to maybe build upon some

871
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,920
of that image detection to have it be

872
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,760
done more Precision um but yeah good

873
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,520
question only optically right now and by

874
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,520
yeah and then the next one is hey Zach

875
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,520
thanks for the talk how is the sticking

876
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,760
working for such a variety of materials

877
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,440
is it always flat means uh parallel to

878
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:17,040
the stamp or is there some

879
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,720
tilt um the only tilt has been

880
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,720
accidental um because my problem for a

881
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:25,280
long time was I would crash the sides

882
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,440
and so I've been trying to make things

883
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,960
as like uh non- tilty as possible and

884
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,480
for those who don't know that's in

885
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,200
contrast to exfoliate materials where

886
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,599
they do put an intentional tilt and the

887
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,520
idea is to sort of squeeze out and push

888
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,520
out junk and I believe that's one reason

889
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,079
exfol material still can produce

890
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,960
possibly a better interface in my

891
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,040
opinion um so no I'm coming down 100% um

892
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,040
at zero degree but the reason it's

893
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,440
sticking is so I've actually left out

894
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,000
many details um just because of limited

895
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,520
talk time and and other stuff and

896
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,839
shiming shout out to shiming and our

897
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,359
group who's helped me with this but we

898
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,319
uh we sort of like detach the 2D

899
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:05,359
materials like they don't want to be on

900
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:07,599
the S2 we put them on and so that allows

901
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,119
us to sort of pick them up um very

902
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,440
easily and that's how we can that's how

903
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,079
we have such high success rates we're

904
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,880
we're like making it so they don't want

905
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,400
to be on the

906
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,079
substrate thank you very much and the

907
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,240
next one uh Zach you are an ex great

908
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,319
expert on this what wise would you gave

909
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,400
someone building their own homebuild

910
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:31,640
setup in their lab for material transfer

911
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,640
or otherwise how do you balance cost

912
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,640
savings with time and

913
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,240
capabilities oh that is also such a good

914
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,800
question that's such a good question so

915
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,640
I didn't think I could ever build this

916
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,440
and then I got to uh Professor Kong's

917
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,240
group and people just like believe in

918
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,119
things like no no we can do it Zach no

919
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,880
problem we just sit down and do it and I

920
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,839
was like okay I guess we'll try and I

921
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,640
still remember the first meeting we had

922
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,280
where we where people are on a

923
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,640
whiteboard and they're figuring out how

924
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,880
to build it and people are being

925
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,599
critical of each other's IDE but no one

926
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,480
took offense and it was like like a

927
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,119
textbook case of how to be a team and in

928
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,119
half an hour we had charted out a design

929
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,200
plan and it was awful I I didn't go that

930
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,880
route but that was but it was perfect as

931
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,760
we've like iterated on that initial

932
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,880
design it's like slowly moved along so I

933
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,640
think what I've learned from this is I

934
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,560
100% could not have done this by myself

935
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,680
maybe not even with five people right

936
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,400
look at the drop off how I hydroxate the

937
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,880
si2 you know that's Professor nar's

938
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,760
group helping me out um Sarah and Peter

939
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,000
and all the different folks there know

940
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,560
and I think even um in pressor mx's

941
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,800
group I visited Stanford so I went and

942
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,880
visit a bunch of groups I'm very

943
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,960
thankful that people shared their

944
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,680
knowledge and um Rita one of his

945
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,200
students made this like off-hand comment

946
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,200
and it solved our pdms problem right you

947
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,040
know and so um I think I just talked to

948
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,480
many people it's 100% teamwork um but I

949
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,520
will say the um stuff in so the motors

950
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,400
that I showed you guys earlier that

951
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,920
automated I guess for our growth um the

952
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,480
software that we use for this we also

953
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,000
apply to our machine so we've cut down

954
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,280
down we've had some tremendous cost

955
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,160
savings because we don't we make a lot

956
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,160
of things ourselves and I'm thankful for

957
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,680
the people in the group for teaching me

958
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,800
how to do that thank you it was really

959
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,240
good question I believe in you yeah

960
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,560
thank you thank you very much Zach and

961
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:19,640
uh this may have been answered but uh

962
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,560
maybe you can uh more speci specific

963
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,520
again why is your machine able to pick

964
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,880
up more types of material than other

965
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,839
designs

966
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,839
okay really really really good question

967
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,720
um okay it's it's so I could have done

968
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,240
the talk two ways I could have either

969
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,119
talked about a machine or I could have

970
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,839
talked about this other work we're doing

971
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:43,920
I'm calling it effective exfoliation um

972
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,760
but I'm gonna I probably shouldn't say

973
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,040
too much I think we might be a get a

974
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,680
patent from it and I feel like this talk

975
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,040
is recorded the patent lers will find me

976
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,359
and say no it's s but um but yeah we

977
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,400
have a method for effectively for

978
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:00,440
removing the uh are these ASG grown mat

979
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,520
Cals and we're placing them on sio2 and

980
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,640
they they don't want to be on sio2 in my

981
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,040
opinion that's how I'm looking at it and

982
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,319
so I think there's like different stuff

983
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,079
like when people spin coat PMA and then

984
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,119
you fish the PMA out of the water and

985
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,160
you put it on top of a substrate and

986
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,960
then you rinse away

987
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,640
the uh the pmma with acetone I believe

988
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,079
there's a gluing aspect going on

989
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,359
somewhere there and and I think people

990
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:25,960
figure it out like you have to fish it

991
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,920
out of liquid maybe some residual

992
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,560
liquids in between Maybe maybe a 2d

993
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,200
layer of water is gluing it or something

994
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,040
like that um but there's definitely like

995
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,400
an adhesion of sorts and so we we sort

996
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,960
of solved that problem where it's not

997
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,880
adhered to the uh surface as much and so

998
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,720
you can even see some issues with see if

999
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,640
I oh um yeah so for example you see how

1000
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,440
the graphine is all broken up that's

1001
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,079
because this transfer process which

1002
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,760
we've approved upon it didn't work that

1003
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,880
well so the graphine picks up from the

1004
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,319
surface but it didn't transfer the

1005
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,880
surface that well because the sio2

1006
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:03,160
didn't want the graphine um so that's

1007
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,880
that's the trick um that that needs to

1008
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,640
be figured out and I can totally I'm

1009
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,880
only only just I don't want to Rob our

1010
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,720
group of a patent or another you know

1011
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,240
and so I'm gonna avoid saying too much

1012
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,760
but please stop on byy or send me an

1013
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,720
email I can definitely be more than

1014
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,319
happy to provide more details um but

1015
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,640
that's that's sort of the trick you have

1016
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,520
to it's just pre-treatment that makes it

1017
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,200
not sticky um I I'm sorry to be so vague

1018
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,520
about it but uh yeah um but please email

1019
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,000
me thank you for the question that's a

1020
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,760
really good question

1021
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,560
thank you very much Zach uh he Zach a

1022
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:36,920
great presentation is the process of

1023
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:40,440
finding the 2D material from the subrate

1024
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,960
automatic or manual ah it's only manuals

1025
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,359
right now but it's one thing we want to

1026
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,240
automate and so I think what I've

1027
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:48,400
learned from this machine is we have

1028
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,000
great potential in many directions to go

1029
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,040
in so not only can we clean the

1030
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,839
substrate but I think we can automate it

1031
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,720
so I'm hoping it can be helpful for

1032
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,000
fundamental science but then also

1033
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,680
industry um so so uh but if folks are

1034
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,240
looking to program or help out we would

1035
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,160
love to help and so um yeah we're

1036
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,560
working on the programming

1037
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,280
aspects thank you and and then the next

1038
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,040
one is what happens to the bonds around

1039
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,640
the

1040
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:20,000
circumference is is it a stamped in

1041
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:22,960
vacuum could you Bast the process in a

1042
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,520
different gases to effect the resulting

1043
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,680
electronic Properties or symmetry

1044
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:35,520
breaking at the edge of the V

1045
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:37,640
she I I believe so um I I was naive I

1046
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,160
had the wrong vacuum for a long time and

1047
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,640
then we recently changed and made some

1048
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,160
improvements um again under Jin sort of

1049
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,520
guidance and we we made these

1050
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,280
improvements and I've noticed a a big

1051
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,559
Improvement to the stacking process so I

1052
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:54,640
believe the gas that's in there does

1053
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:57,160
seem to affect um the stack and how much

1054
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,839
bonding there is and other stuff um but

1055
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,839
I 100% haven't explored it I hopefully

1056
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,160
we can get a publication out eventually

1057
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:05,160
and then this will just be like one

1058
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,920
stepping stone on the way very good

1059
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,680
question yeah thank you very much and

1060
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,000
the next one is heack super interesting

1061
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:17,319
do the temperature change when the stamp

1062
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,160
releases the 2D material compared when

1063
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:26,240
picking up oh such a good question that

1064
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:29,559
is such a good question okay so we found

1065
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:33,079
out we effectively had to heat our stamp

1066
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,960
to get the results to work um and so

1067
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,760
when we didn't heat the stamp the stamp

1068
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,400
was at room temperature and it touched

1069
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,040
the heated stage and what do polymers do

1070
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,119
when they're heated they expand however

1071
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,040
the machine was fixed so the polymer had

1072
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:48,280
nowhere to go and it moved and it

1073
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,760
shifted and we have tons of movies

1074
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,119
trying to figure out what's you know

1075
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,280
what's going on and how we can resolve

1076
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,839
it and um and ever since we've added

1077
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,760
this like heated stamp um it's there

1078
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:03,119
seems to be no movement and um I don't

1079
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,520
know it's it's a I believe it's a huge

1080
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,160
increase in performance and so um so

1081
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,599
yeah so the heated stamp and keeping

1082
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,599
things the same has improved from that

1083
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,160
aspect um did I answer the question
