00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,200
Thank you. Hello, I'm Peter Schmidt,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,880
co-founder, CEO at Fluent Metal, where

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,480
we inventing the future of metal 3D

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,040
printing.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,160
What carried me away was watching our

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,320
advisory co-founder, John Hart, speak

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,160
just a couple of minutes ago, freely

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,160
walking around the stage. I'm sorry.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,080
3D printing in general, metal 3D

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,760
printing as well still has a very strong

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,320
promise.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
It is very useful and it going to be

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,360
needed in fusion reactors, hypersonics,

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,760
electric vehicles, server farms,

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,239
consumer products, all of those need

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,920
complex

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,800
metal components made from special

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
metals with integrates design.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,520
The problem we're seeing is current

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,039
manufacturing and that involves metal

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,120
additive as it's practiced today cannot

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,640
deliver on those materials geometries

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,960
and they cannot deliver at an

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,960
economically feasible um cost.

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
What does fluent metal do? If there's

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,479
one thing I want you to take away from

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,960
the five minutes we have together today,

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,680
I want you to remember fluent metal is

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,520
printing metal differently just like

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,840
inkjet printers but with molten metal

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,680
droplets instead of ink droplets. So

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
what we're doing is we take a fine

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,880
microwire. We heat up the tip of the

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,520
fine microwire with a plasma within

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,079
several milliseconds grows into a ball.

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,200
We go through a hygiene event, separates

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,880
the ball into an airborne droplet, flies

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,159
to the substrate. We introduce

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,360
a heat budget, meaning more more we're

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
printing at higher temperatures than

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
melting, and that enables the drop to

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
have a metallergical bond at the

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
substrate.

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
We can do that with any metal that comes

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,560
in wire form. And we can do this in

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
parallel with the same metal or we can

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,960
do this in different metals, multi

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,240
metals.

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,920
So what are the advantages of practicing

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
metal additive metal 3D printing this

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,560
way? We are really really cost

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,319
efficient. Our system architecture uh

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,959
allows uh for scalable um throughput

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,599
and

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,239
large reduction in cost. We have a

56
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,560
materials portfolio that no other metal

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,239
additive process has. We can print

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,000
straight off of wire. So we can print

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,720
anything in wireform including all the

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,560
alloys that everyone is looking after

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,400
which cannot be delivered by powder bed

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,920
processes.

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,440
We and that also includes uh high metal

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
high high melting temperature metals

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,200
like refractory metals. It also includes

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,680
amorphous metals. Um just had a really

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,560
um promising collaboration there with um

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,920
with a team a research team in in

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,920
amorphous metals. We can print on many

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
different um substrates. Um we could

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
print on plastics, we can print on

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,040
metal, we can print on single on

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,159
straight double curved surfaces. Um

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,840
everything no problem. And then the most

75
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,200
important point, we're not moving a melt

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,640
pool around. So we're not putting a lot

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,599
of heat into any um substrate substrate.

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,040
So that it's also a big advantage of our

79
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:27,440
process. We do have an industrial uh

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:30,239
approved um use case. Um it's uh an OEM

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,400
manufacturer where we are applying a

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,720
layer of bronze onto an existing layer

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
of stainless steel which is part of an

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,799
assembly

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,040
and that's the reason why the

86
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,360
requirement is there to not heat up the

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,560
top surface more than 80° centigrade

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,879
which with um a direct energy deposition

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,840
or a part of laser is is is not

90
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,640
achievable. uh our process works uh no

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,760
problems for the metallergy and we've

92
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,159
proven um sample parts and going into a

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,879
pilot production with this uh OEM

94
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,799
currently.

95
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
We're here today looking for

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480
partnerships um seeking uh

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,400
collaborations.

98
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,040
We're looking for partners in the energy

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,519
defense and automotive industry

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,000
ideally with experience in metal

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,720
additive and with problems that we

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,560
hopefully be able to solve better than

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,840
what you're currently doing. We do have

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,840
a desk next door. Uh my colleague Mario

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,919
uh myself will be there. Um would love

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,840
to yeah for you guys to stop by have

107
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,840
some conversations. Thank you very much.
