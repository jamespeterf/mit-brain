1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:01,034
(buoyant music)

2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,580
- My name is Mina Konakovic Lukovic

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,970
and I'm an assistant
professor at EECS at MIT,

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,650
and I'm also part of CSAIL

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,620
I lead a group called
Algorithmic Design Group

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,410
and this is my second
year as a professor here.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,560
When I was thinking about what
I want to do for my studies,

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,820
I was actually deciding

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,410
between architecture,
mathematics, and medicine

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,530
and in the end, I chose
mathematics and computer science

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,880
because that lets me touch

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,190
upon all of these areas in some sense.

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,600
Before coming to MIT,

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,620
I was a PhD student at EPFL
in Lausanne in Switzerland,

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,740
where I was working mostly
on geometry processing

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,200
and I wasn't doing any
of the machine learning

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,060
or robotics things before.

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,710
And I was fortunate enough

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,510
to get a postdoctoral fellowship

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,490
called Schmidt Science Fellowship,

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,400
where they offer you to go and study

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,110
wherever you want in the world,

23
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,500
but also pivot the area
that you are working on.

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,880
That's what led me to MIT,

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,478
because MIT is the best place

26
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,980
that does those kinds of applications

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,690
and is one of the rare places

28
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,140
where you can actually do
this kind of exotic research,

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,660
but also be on top of the game.

30
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,863
So I was fortunate enough to come here

31
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,714
before the faculty job as postdoc,

32
00:01:14,714 --> 00:01:18,750
'cause that let me also
get familiar with MIT,

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,680
with this environment,

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
it's a special kind of environment

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,280
that you don't see in most places.

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,956
My mentor was Wojciech Matusik,

37
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:27,300
a very well known established researcher

38
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,770
in the field of computer graphics,

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,330
but also known for exploring
very risky and novel directions

40
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,531
that are not typical
for computer graphics.

41
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:39,180
He was one of the pioneers
and one of the researchers

42
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,730
who started exploring
this computational design

43
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,170
and fabrication direction,

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,534
and robotics within computer graphics,

45
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:48,822
which led me to join his group.

46
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:53,460
In my group, we work mostly
on developing new algorithms

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,800
that help you design or fabricate things

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,500
in a more efficient way
or a more optimal way

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,210
than what you can do manually.

50
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,940
We do a less traditional
kind of research here

51
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,250
where we do play with 3D models,

52
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,370
so we do have to leverage
some of the famous algorithms

53
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,680
that we're developing with
the computer graphics,

54
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,900
but we do use them in applications,

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,350
such as robotics, such as material design,

56
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,735
such as designing transformable
structures and so on.

57
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:22,800
I really like the environment
that we created here.

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,110
People are complimenting
each other's skills

59
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,834
in a way that it does not create
a competitive environment,

60
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:31,740
which I find very important,
that they're actually friends

61
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,740
and they feel open
coming and talking to me

62
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,160
any day if leave my office door open.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,660
I think that's the kind of environment

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,760
that I would also like to
keep throughout my career

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,660
because I feel

66
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,270
that they're really enjoying
their time together,

67
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,600
that also helps them move
further in their research

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,180
and in their careers in
a more healthier way.

69
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,320
- Working with Mina is great,

70
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,210
like Mina gives us a proper balance

71
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,960
of like independence and also
how much guidance we require

72
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,930
and also she maintains a proper lab vibe.

73
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,474
- We get a lot of intellectual freedom.

74
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,640
We work on everything from
like geometry to biology,

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,390
to machine learning, to
robotics, it's amazing.

76
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,510
- My favorite thing about
MIT is definitely people,

77
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,830
the people that you meet here

78
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,280
and that you have an opportunity
to interact with here,

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,780
you don't see that elsewhere,
it's really amazing.
