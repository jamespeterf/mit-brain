1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
I liked making things in Algeria.

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,879
We had a mechanic next door, so I would

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,965
go and tinker and work with him.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,800
So that hands-on

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,845
experience came from there.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,805
That's what MIT is about.

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,349
So somehow I arrived to MIT later,

8
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,186
and I find that this place emphasizes the

9
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,313
hand and the mind together.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,775
I was born and raised in Algeria.

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,278
In a small town at that

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,447
time called Qasl al-Bukhari,

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,907
it's actually a beautiful still today,

14
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,034
with the mountains and the plains.

15
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,579
My father was killed.

16
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,331
I was maybe about three years old.

17
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,585
My elder brother at that time who was, I

18
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,837
would say, 12 or 13 years old,

19
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,505
so he became the head of the family.

20
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,888
We did not have many

21
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,473
books or access to books.

22
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,226
Sometimes a person can get a book maybe

23
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,479
from France or from someplace,

24
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,482
and then the book is passed around, a

25
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,983
book on math or physics.

26
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,360
I was very, very weak in math.

27
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,154
My brother, Mahfoud

28
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,031
one summer, took me aside.

29
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,991
Till today, I don't know what he did,

30
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,284
but he kind of 

31
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,410
got the right trigger.

32
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,912
I sat down with him and

33
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,163
he was teaching me math.

34
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,959
So then I went from below zero to

35
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,295
getting the first prize in

36
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,838
mathematics that next year.

37
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,882
I wanted to go abroad,

38
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,675
but not any other place.

39
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,553
It was the United States of America.

40
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,598
So when I came to Boston, I was at BU.

41
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,559
One time, the instructor took me and a

42
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,685
couple of other students

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,814
by the Charles River on the Boston side.

44
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,024
So then she says, "Do you

45
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,526
know what those buildings are?"

46
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,486
That is MIT.

47
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,280
And I say to myself, "I

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,490
have to be with those people."

49
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,286
So the work that I do is in design,

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,373
modeling, dynamic

51
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,625
systems, control systems.

52
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,919
And also you could say maybe adding

53
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,255
intelligence to systems.

54
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,173
And all of this applied

55
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,634
to robotics, automation.

56
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,681
With a place like MIT, you get all these

57
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,891
opportunities to work with

58
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,227
among the most intelligent people.

59
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,896
You can just pick up the phone and maybe

60
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,439
you're speaking directly

61
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,025
to one of the world experts

62
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,486
in nanomaterials or what have you.

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,989
And with that, you

64
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,866
can do maybe big things.

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,119
And so when you work in these kinds of

66
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,787
activities or programs,

67
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,540
then you can see the

68
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,625
impact at a large scale.

69
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,879
We don't have to wait maybe many years,

70
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,963
but you can see that in

71
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,715
a short amount of time,

72
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,592
the impact that they are doing.

73
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,802
And that is, I think, very rewarding.
