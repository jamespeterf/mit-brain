1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
so I'm going to take a card at

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,639
random um RI rising sea levels uh

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,040
flooding yes ha beautiful hi I'm Ali

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,160
Leslie and I'm representing uh climate

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,400
change charades uh for the day of

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,160
climate for MIT basically this activity

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,880
is meant to be a bridging activity for

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,600
classroom teachers to be able to go from

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,279
their lessons on what is happening to

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,439
our planet before they start actually

11
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,840
talking about Solutions oil breathing

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,559
breathing or carbon dioxide uh

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,960
oh at the end of the activity students

14
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,879
are going to take all of the vocab that

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,000
they reviewed and create a concept map

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,039
um allowing them to link these ideas to

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,800
one another to recognize that climate

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,719
change is a very very big very very

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,879
complex issue and it's not a direct

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,280
cause and effect relationship and now

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
we're going to investigate real

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,879
solutions to these real problems for

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,719
more MIT moments from MIT open learning
