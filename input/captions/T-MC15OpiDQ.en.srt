1
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,440
- Welcome.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,845
Thank you for gathering.

3
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:22,644
It's truly a pleasure
to introduce Keith Lynn

4
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:26,160
who is a member of Lockheed Martin,

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,390
part of Lockheed Martin.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,340
Lockheed Martin is an organization

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,090
that recently joined the
industrial consortium of MIT.nano.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,040
They also recently joined
Industrial Consortium of MTL.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,860
And together our organizations
indeed are looking at ways

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,210
of furthering our depth

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,370
of interactions with Lockheed Martin.

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,100
As a part of that, we have asked them

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,040
to send us the very best
person they have, (laughing)

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,540
and that's Keith,

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,330
who can tell us very deeply
about the connections

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,120
that we possibly could
establish between us

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,930
and, indeed, Lockheed Martin as a company.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,100
Let me just give you a
few snippets about Keith.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,500
Keith Lynn is a senior manager of space

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,100
and strategic high performance
computing solutions,

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,540
and the site leader

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,700
for Lockheed Martin's Microelectronics

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,220
R&D Fabrication Center.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,370
Since taking this position in 2020,

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,260
Keith led numerous efforts

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,470
in 3D heterogeneous
integration technology,

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,230
high temperature gallium
nitride electronics,

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,680
flex hybrid packaging, antitamper devices,

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,620
and engineered biological materials.

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,830
Keith works closely with
Department of Defense stakeholders

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,864
and Lockheed Martin's program offices

32
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,150
to conduct operations analysis

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,190
and mission analysis modeling,

34
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,080
an important step for understanding

35
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,770
how new technologies improve
the utility of platforms

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,420
in the field.

37
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,750
Keith frequently collaborates
with semiconductor companies

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,950
and Fortune 50 technology
providers to foster integration

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,230
of commercial technology into defense

40
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,360
and security architectures.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,220
As such, Keith is member

42
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,140
of the Lockheed Martin Strategic
Collaborations Initiative,

43
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,983
overseen by the CTO,
Chief Technology Officer.

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,160
In this capacity, Keith works closely

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,160
with the organization's
director to form and implement

46
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,480
joint technology development agreements

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,610
and critical technology partners.

48
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,570
And hence he's here to think
about what can we do together.

49
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,370
Keith, please take over and tell us more.

50
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,230
- All right, thank you very much.

51
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,130
Thank you.
(audience applauding)

52
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,900
So as Vlad mentioned,
my name is Keith Lynn.

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,730
I've been with Lockheed Martin
for I think 16 years now.

54
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,470
I got the 15 year commemorative
pin a couple months ago,

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,630
so 15 and some change.

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,590
And I've loved Lockheed Martin so much

57
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,740
that I've stayed there my
entire professional career.

58
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,240
And I feel like I've worked
15 different jobs in 15 years

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,660
because the technology evolves so quickly

60
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,780
and there's so many
different technology facets

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,470
and mission facets in Lockheed
that it never becomes dull.

62
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,670
But I have to say, I'm finally
starting to feel old now.

63
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm 37.

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,000
And I never really felt old
'cause it was so dynamic,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,690
but now I am, because
I'm finally seeing things

66
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,270
come full circle in the industry.

67
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,120
They say the defense industry
is very cyclical as it is.

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,160
But I remember when I was very young

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,130
and very bright-eyed, fresh outta college,

70
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,850
the first thing I worked
on was nanotechnology,

71
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,120
which was the hot, up and coming thing.

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,780
Back then it was mostly carbon
nanotubes and buckyballs

73
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,020
and everything like
that was the big thing.

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,820
And now here we are again,

75
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,343
nanotechnology is the new technology area

76
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,850
that I think is gonna
revolutionize the industry,

77
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,350
many industries.

78
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,600
And it's not that it
was and that it wasn't

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,470
and it was again,

80
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,470
it's what constitutes nanoscale
technology is evolving.

81
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,710
And now we're talking
microelectronics that are nanoscale.

82
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,350
Microelectronics is a
bit of an outdated term.

83
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,080
And I'm excited to see it come back

84
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,180
and I'm excited to see that,

85
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,350
I dunno if you know the
hype cycle ideology,

86
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,240
that things are big hype

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,330
and then they fall into a
trough of disillusionment,

88
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,620
then they become popular again.

89
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,840
But the whole time people
are steadily working on them

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,780
to improve them and bring
new applications to fruition.

91
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,620
I feel like we're at that point
with nanoscale technology.

92
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,453
And I'm gonna talk a little bit

93
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:44,580
about how I think that's
gonna impact my industry

94
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,010
and the challenges we're
currently trying to solve

95
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,020
where we look to consortiums
like MIT.nano for solutions

96
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,940
in collaboration with universities

97
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,773
and with commercial partners.

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,460
So Lockheed Martin by the numbers,

99
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,900
for those of you who don't
know Lockheed Martin,

100
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,610
we are a global security
aerospace and defense company.

101
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,893
Our largest customer is the US government.

102
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,910
And we employ somewhere
around 60,000 engineers.

103
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,653
Ebbs and flows, but it's
a very large company.

104
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,760
You know, a lot of people come up to me

105
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,780
and say, "Oh, you work at Lockheed,

106
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,120
you must know so-and-so."

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,140
30% chance.

108
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,880
You know, I've been around a little while,

109
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,590
so maybe 35% for me.

110
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,620
But the company does a lot of things.

111
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,040
There's a lot of people
across many, many locations.

112
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,430
I was just having a conversation
a minute ago about my site

113
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,000
here in Greater Boston only has 10 people,

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,940
but I manage 20 people in Denver

115
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,653
and I have about 200 affiliates
between the Bay Area,

116
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,160
Huntsville, Alabama, Utah,
and a few other places.

117
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,670
So, you know, in a post-COVID world,

118
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,040
it doesn't make as much of a difference,

119
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,410
but we are everywhere.

120
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,870
And we operate four primary business units

121
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,610
that you can see here.

122
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,603
Aeronautics.

123
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,980
MFC, which stands for
missiles and fire control.

124
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,053
RMS and Space.

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,830
Space is pretty self-evident,
RMS not so much.

126
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,450
RMS does radar systems,

127
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,680
they do surface ships, they do submarines,

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,940
they do some helicopter subsystem.

129
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,960
So that's a hard one to
just understand by the name.

130
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,350
But we like to say that
we cover all domains,

131
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,713
land, air, sea, space, and
now increasingly cyber.

132
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,360
In addition to our core enterprise,

133
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,180
we operate multiple subsidiaries.

134
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,700
And we maintain very large supply chains

135
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,390
with many small business
and commercial suppliers.

136
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,590
So we like to think of
ourselves more holistically as,

137
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,310
you know, the enterprise
plus the affiliates.

138
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,510
So everything we do, every,

139
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,330
you know, the F-35 or satellite system

140
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,010
will have a huge tail of
suppliers and partners

141
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,350
and facilitators that make
the whole thing possible.

142
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,603
So it never just stops at Lockheed Martin.

143
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,720
In addition to that, we
operate internationally,

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,060
I think the last chart shows
what percentage of our business

145
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,053
that accounts for.

146
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:28,320
26%, that's growing.

147
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,930
International is becoming
more and more prominent.

148
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,940
The way that we engage
internationally is changing.

149
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,680
It used to be more hands off.

150
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,130
Now it's more direct engagement
with foreign governments.

151
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,800
And we maintain outposts and partnerships

152
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,950
and affiliations across
a number of countries.

153
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,990
The silhouettes are shown there.

154
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,000
I can tell you that UK is quite large

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,403
and Australia and Canada
are also quite large.

156
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,670
Sometimes when we do
international business,

157
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,790
it leads to some really
interesting scenarios.

158
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,400
I like to talk about this one
'cause it's kind of funny.

159
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,800
And this chart probably
makes no sense to anybody.

160
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,190
But one of the things you
do in the defense industry

161
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,390
when you do international business

162
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,433
is something called industrial offsets,

163
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:11,490
which means that a percentage of the value

164
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,490
of every defense sale has to be matched

165
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,040
with other investments in-country,

166
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,210
and it has to be collaborated

167
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,820
with the governments of those countries.

168
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,362
One example that I worked a few years back

169
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:26,730
was for the sale of F-35
aircraft in Denmark.

170
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,400
We went to Denmark, we
talked to their ministries,

171
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,409
and they were very interested

172
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,570
in applying some of the sensor
technology from the aircraft

173
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,310
to other industries.

174
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,040
And one in particular
was cold supply chain,

175
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,790
which is really prominent
in the dairy industry.

176
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,770
And their dream was to
have that technology

177
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,890
make it into the US agricultural markets.

178
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,810
So in order to facilitate
this airplane sale,

179
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,930
we had to go back to
the US, talk to the USDA

180
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,150
about where we could apply this technology

181
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,760
to make a big economic impact.

182
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,070
And I remember going to Chicago

183
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,100
to meet with the Dairy
Management Institute.

184
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,210
It's the nonprofit that
does the Got Milk campaigns.

185
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,871
And I'm sitting in their boardroom

186
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:12,030
and I have representatives
from USDA and the DMI

187
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,223
and a couple other
affiliate organizations.

188
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:16,957
And we ask them, you know,

189
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,530
"We wanna help solve a
major technical challenge

190
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,930
for the US agricultural industry.

191
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,120
What are your top problems?"

192
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,470
And I remember very distinctly,

193
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,680
he sits back in his chair
and he rubs his chin

194
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,680
and he goes, "Cheese
smugglers." (laughing)

195
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:37,140
And we just kind of stared
at him for a second,

196
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,807
said, "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"

197
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,483
And he said,

198
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,010
"Cheese smuggling is a major
problem in this country.

199
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,844
You know, everybody thinks

200
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,950
we have an illegal immigration problem,

201
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,230
but we have an illegal cheese problem.

202
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,910
And many, many people get sick
from bathtub queso fresco."

203
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,260
And I said, "Okay, bathtub, explain."

204
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,390
And he says, "You know,
well, it's like bathtub gin

205
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,100
back during the Prohibition.

206
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,230
People make queso fresco in their bathtubs

207
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,820
and they run it across the border.

208
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,840
And we gotta catch them

209
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,340
before they get it into the supply chain

210
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,070
or else many, many people could get sick."

211
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,430
So that's what I spent
six months working on.

212
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,160
And this was all to sell aircraft.

213
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,800
So this is why I stay at the company.

214
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,210
There's a lot of creative things

215
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,800
that are more art than science.

216
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,930
And if you're someone like me

217
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,370
who likes to have a creative side,

218
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,440
then there's always
something that you can do

219
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,030
that's fun and rewarding

220
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,600
and lets you see some interesting places

221
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,250
and meet some interesting people.

222
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,070
All right, so where are we
today in the defense industry?

223
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,210
Well, Lockheed Martin

224
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,120
and our CEO Jim Taiclet
has set out a strategy

225
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,580
called 21st Century Security.

226
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,540
And this is meant to
address the evolving world

227
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,071
that we live in, which is itself

228
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:56,180
driven by transformational technologies,

229
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,479
moving towards more of
a digital landscape,

230
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:04,479
moving to a world where more
assets can do more computation

231
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,230
and communication with each other

232
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,633
and rely less on a hub and spoke model.

233
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,870
So these are the imperatives
that we have set forth

234
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,710
to pursue over the next decade or so

235
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,752
to help bring modern technology
into the way that we operate

236
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:23,610
from a national security standpoint.

237
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,970
Networked platforms,
this is, the graphic here

238
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,370
you can see talks a little bit to that.

239
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,860
Aircraft talking to
satellites, talking to drones,

240
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,840
talking to ground
platforms, talking to ships,

241
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,020
talking to infantry on the ground.

242
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,670
It's all connected.

243
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,720
And it's not just passing
raw data back and forth,

244
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,340
it's collecting data,
processing it, interpreting it,

245
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,323
sending that information
to another platform

246
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:52,470
without having to go back
to a central terminal.

247
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,950
So we call this edge computing
and distributed computing.

248
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,650
And this is a major challenge right now

249
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,510
because this is not traditionally

250
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,490
how architectures are designed.

251
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,970
So you are dealing with
legacy communication protocols

252
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,300
like Link 16, which is
used on F-16 aircraft,

253
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,910
that was not at all meant
to operate this way.

254
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,230
And it's tried and true

255
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,700
and they are not gonna get rid of it,

256
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,250
but yet it somehow has to
fit into this architecture

257
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,370
and operate in ways it was
never intended to operate.

258
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,113
So very difficult challenge.

259
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,330
We're also looking at

260
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,480
how do we put more advanced
computing on these platforms

261
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,730
so that we can do more
of that edge processing

262
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,020
and we can reduce latency

263
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,810
and we can reduce size,
weight, and power, or SWP?

264
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,600
So you can not just
have your best computing

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,433
on your largest aircraft,

266
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,401
but you could put them
on very small drones,

267
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:42,960
very small CubeSats and PicoSats.

268
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,010
That's another challenge.

269
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,920
And not just getting the technology there,

270
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,890
but putting the technology
in an environment

271
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,420
where it's not intended to operate.

272
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,140
So it has to experience extreme
fluctuations in temperature

273
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,660
or shock and vibration to put it in space,

274
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,520
or radiation environments

275
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,000
where it has to have countermeasures
to mitigate the effects

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,790
of ionizing doses of radiation.

277
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,790
So commercial technology is here,

278
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,710
and defense technology
can sometimes be here

279
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,750
because the gap to bring

280
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,300
that technology into the
relevant environments

281
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,190
is quite difficult.

282
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,000
And there's a quite high bar
that the government puts on

283
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,430
quality and trust in
anything that they field.

284
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,940
They don't like to wing anything.

285
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,130
It has to be extremely high fidelity,

286
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,831
that it will work as intended

287
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:36,870
because there are high stakes.

288
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,090
So that is something
we're always trying to do,

289
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,500
to close that gap.

290
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,987
And historically, some of those systems

291
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:47,430
originated within the defense industry

292
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,290
and we could just continue to work them

293
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,030
specifically for our applications.

294
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,230
Today it's not the case.

295
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,520
A lot of the leading technologies

296
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,289
are coming from commercial companies.

297
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:57,300
This is not their core market.

298
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,382
They're not spending their money

299
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:02,070
specifically to enable our mission.

300
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,660
We have to figure out
how to work with them

301
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,260
to take commercial technology
that's meant for your iPhones

302
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,960
or for 5G telecommunications

303
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,330
and make them fit into our needs.

304
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,360
And that is why, as part of
the title of this presentation

305
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,000
and something that you'll
see repeated again and again,

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,190
we're doing all this work
with commercial companies

307
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,070
to figure out the right impedance match

308
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,293
to form those lucrative partnerships.

309
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,420
So back to this slide,

310
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,820
now talk a little bit about
my role in the company.

311
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,280
I'm part of Lockheed Martin Space,

312
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,821
so the one on the far right there.

313
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:40,770
And in addition to sitting in Space,

314
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,944
not literally, figuratively,

315
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:45,600
I work with the corporate
offices at Lockheed Martin.

316
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,600
This is the CTO has his own
division at our enterprise,

317
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,120
which oversees strategic initiatives

318
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,200
for the entire corporation.

319
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,670
So you can think of each business area

320
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,390
as really focused on their
swim lane, on the products

321
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,660
and the missions and the
customers that are relevant

322
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,540
for aircraft or helicopter systems

323
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,610
or rotorcraft, satellites, et cetera.

324
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,790
Corporate looks at things that maybe

325
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,420
don't fall above the line
for any one of those groups,

326
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,590
but are important for
all of them holistically.

327
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,240
They make those strategic investments.

328
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,283
So some of the strategic partnerships,

329
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:25,332
some of the university engagements,

330
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:30,332
and then some of the tech
initiatives that don't always

331
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,440
get talked about in the business
areas like microelectronics

332
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,003
fall in the corporate purview.

333
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,560
It's very difficult to
talk to the program manager

334
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,700
of the F-35 about transistor architectures

335
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,510
and gate-all-around and
FinFET versus traditional.

336
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,343
They don't care.

337
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:53,010
They care about how far can I fly?

338
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,840
What's my ceiling, what's
my weapons payload,

339
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,700
what's my, you know, radar,
electronic warfare capability?

340
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,930
You know, you have to be able

341
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,500
to translate the nitty gritty
into the so what, who cares,

342
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,640
how does it affect the mission,

343
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,340
how does it keep the pilot
safe, et cetera, et cetera.

344
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,050
So understanding how to
do that is difficult.

345
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,970
It's taken me quite a
few years in the company

346
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,960
to figure out the value prop to go from

347
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,400
extremely deep technology

348
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
to things that are gonna move the needle

349
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,210
for our national security.

350
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,302
And being able to work
at the corporate level

351
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:32,910
on the finer detail technology

352
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,490
and then pull that back
into the business areas

353
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,590
where we can talk about mission capability

354
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,760
is extremely important.

355
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,330
So that's why I've made
it a point to straddle

356
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,910
between those two groups
within the company

357
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,700
so that I can be a Rosetta Stone

358
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,673
and translate between mission
speak and technology speak.

359
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,730
And this is just a little
more detail about what I do.

360
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,370
That's me, if you didn't notice
that already. (chuckling)

361
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,330
And these are some of the
things that are in my purview.

362
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,580
Between my facility here,

363
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,990
I'm essentially general manager

364
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,680
for our high mix semiconductor lab

365
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,600
in Billerica, Massachusetts.

366
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,717
And I oversee some engineering
groups out in Denver.

367
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:18,330
And I manage a hypersonic platforms group

368
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,948
in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

369
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:23,610
So everything from gallium
nitride, thin films,

370
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,460
flexible electronics, specialty coatings,

371
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,620
we even get into engineered
biological materials.

372
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,810
So we source materials

373
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,851
that are derived from modified bacteria

374
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:37,410
and we apply them to
various optics and coatings

375
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,760
and things like that to determine

376
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,620
if they can improve performance

377
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,170
over non-biological source materials.

378
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,360
Or in the case of things
like rare earth elements

379
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,130
where there's a supply chain problem

380
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,960
or there could potentially be a problem,

381
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,213
we look for alternative
sources of material.

382
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,630
On the computing side,

383
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,360
this moves a little bit
away from microelectronics

384
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,790
and just more into solutions,
where we're doing a blend

385
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:05,760
of COTS procurement and custom design.

386
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,950
We look at high performance
compute solutions

387
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,570
and architectures.

388
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,790
So you know, if we want to have,

389
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,560
again, starting with the mission speak,

390
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,560
if you want to have broader
coverage of EO-IR observation

391
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,850
of certain latitudes on the planet,

392
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,570
and you wanna be able to
communicate that information

393
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,100
with a certain latency
to your airborne assets

394
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,640
or your ocean based assets
in the South Pacific,

395
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,120
then you need to figure out what type

396
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,710
of data you're gonna be getting,

397
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,300
how much noise you have to filter out,

398
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,160
how fast you have to process it,

399
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,230
what processors are capable of doing that,

400
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,460
how many of them do you need?

401
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,870
Do they have to be co-located?

402
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,130
Can they be distributed?

403
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,710
How do you communicate between
them if they're distributed?

404
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,630
What kind of environmental
conditions do they have

405
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,750
to be modified to survive, et cetera.

406
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,290
So it's a very complicated thing
to walk it all the way back

407
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,680
to knowing exactly what your
technical solution has to be.

408
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,840
And that's what our network architecture

409
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,660
and distributed computing
groups are actively doing

410
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,183
with our program offices
and with our customers.

411
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,280
Hypersonics is a very interesting area.

412
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,640
It is the motherlode of extreme conditions

413
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,300
that you don't find anywhere else

414
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,793
in terms of shock,
vibration, heat, ablation,

415
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,390
plasma fields, all kinds of things

416
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,210
that are new engineering
challenges you have to work around.

417
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,800
I have a slide on this a little later,

418
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,600
so I'll go into that in more detail.

419
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,270
But again, another interesting area.

420
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,560
And the things we develop there,

421
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,050
we also find have relevance
in other places as well.

422
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,440
So usually when you work on
the most extreme of extremes,

423
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,303
you find utility in other places.

424
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,476
I mentioned microelectronics.

425
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:52,560
We still operate platforms

426
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,770
that have been in use since the 1960s.

427
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,710
And many of them still use compute systems

428
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,710
that are from the 1960s on
180 nanometer CMOS or above.

429
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,080
That's because they were
qualified extensively

430
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,913
back in the day,

431
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:10,710
and we know they work and we
have plenty of data to prove it

432
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,970
and we continue to use them.

433
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,680
But that mentality cannot persist forever.

434
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,960
So we are very actively looking at ways

435
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,980
to modernize those
capabilities, to not lose any

436
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,380
of the trust and assurance
we currently have,

437
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,030
but to enable our customers
to onboard new capability

438
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,060
because we have more
sophisticated technology

439
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,143
to bring to bear.

440
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,520
And the CHIPS Act has been a
major help from our government

441
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,110
in facilitating collaboration

442
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,900
with the semiconductor
industry to make that possible.

443
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,300
So we're now working
directly with foundries

444
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,230
with assembly and test
capabilities or OSATs.

445
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,470
We're working with catalog part suppliers.

446
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,950
There's been a catalyzation

447
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,240
of support from the industry
for the last year or so

448
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,880
and I think in the next
couple years going forward,

449
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,470
where we can really make strides

450
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,530
and understanding how
we modernize technology

451
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,690
without compromising any of the benefits

452
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,033
of those legacy systems.

453
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,870
I like the quote here, "We go
from airplanes with computers

454
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,077
to airplanes just being flying computers."

455
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,440
I think that's probably
an oversimplification,

456
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,093
but it's quite true.

457
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,140
The electronics in aircraft in years past,

458
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,830
and if you look at the percentage
of total development spend

459
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,960
that is accountable to
electronics in aircraft,

460
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,550
for most of aviation history,
it's been minimal, under 10%.

461
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,870
Now I'd say it's over 40%, closer to 50%.

462
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,703
So they really are flying computers.

463
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,500
I mentioned that collaboration.

464
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,440
These are just a couple
headlines I pulled about areas

465
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,690
where we've been working commercially.

466
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,640
The first one up here is IBM.

467
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,100
We have quite a large
partnership with IBM,

468
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,560
done a lot of work with
Red Hat specifically

469
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,930
to bring AI development

470
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,293
and AI deployment to the edge
in a more efficient process.

471
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,750
We've worked with
NVIDIA, this is maybe one

472
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,660
of our longest-standing
commercial partnerships.

473
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,848
And one of the major areas there

474
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:21,660
that we've gotten a lot of
progress made is in deploying AI

475
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,740
for some missions like firefighting

476
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,293
and search and rescue
in the Canadian forests.

477
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,410
These are areas that get a lot of support,

478
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,970
especially in states like California

479
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,640
and in Alberta where there these problems

480
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,170
are pretty prominent.

481
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,567
And they're actually,

482
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,790
not only are they solving a challenge,

483
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,810
an environmental challenge

484
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,090
and a challenge that affects human lives

485
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,870
on the civil side, but
they're also quite pragmatic

486
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,010
for implementation

487
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,810
in some of the defense
environments as well.

488
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,460
So this has been a very
lucrative partnership for us.

489
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,030
Third one there is Global Foundries.

490
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,810
I believe that's our CEO there
with Senator Chuck Schumer

491
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,810
and the, I believe,
CTO of Global Foundries

492
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,025
up in Malta, New York.

493
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:08,190
This is one that I've been part of.

494
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,706
And we are now working
with Global Foundries

495
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:15,460
on a number of initiatives
to understand the future of

496
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,450
embedded CMOS technologies

497
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,700
and how it can apply to
the defense industry.

498
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,450
Another one you may have heard
of is with General Motors.

499
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,530
We actually worked on
a lunar rover program,

500
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,750
the next generation lunar rover.

501
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,390
This was a really fun
collaboration where, you know,

502
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,390
GM is investing heavily in
electronic automotive technology

503
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,540
and we have a legacy
working on lunar vehicles

504
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,370
and lunar support systems.

505
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:48,076
And they seem like a mutually
beneficial partnership

506
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:49,380
for multiple reasons.

507
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,870
There's a lot of information you can read

508
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,440
about future lunar economy
and service models around,

509
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,400
you know, you don't have

510
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,260
to bring your truck to the moon with you,

511
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,390
you go to the truck and you rent,

512
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,060
it's, you know, Avis
on the moon basically.

513
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,790
So not only is technology transforming,

514
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,960
business models are as well,

515
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,363
so that's a pretty interesting one.

516
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,500
And then lastly here, we just
had some public announcements

517
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,179
around working with Microsoft

518
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,800
and figuring out ways

519
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,350
to leverage cloud in more
government environments.

520
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,480
Traditionally it's been
challenging to do cloud

521
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,060
in a fully secure way.

522
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,010
Companies like Microsoft
are changing that.

523
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,830
And once you pull that technology in

524
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,040
and you start to leverage
it, it opens up many doors

525
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
of capabilities and collaboration
and workflow efficiencies

526
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,590
that the government
hasn't traditionally seen.

527
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,390
So that's also very exciting.

528
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,970
Not as sexy as a moon rover,

529
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,763
but equally important, if not more.

530
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,210
Okay, nanoscale innovation across domains.

531
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,090
So the two disciplines I
showed on the previous slide

532
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,550
where I do most of my work
over the last few years

533
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:59,790
are satellite systems
and hypersonic flight.

534
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,853
And I mentioned that they
have a lot of common,

535
00:25:04,173 --> 00:25:05,760
you know, inflection points

536
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,250
or they have some
technology that overlaps.

537
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,960
Although the environments
are kind of different,

538
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,970
you see innovations happening in a lot

539
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,400
of the same areas like
structural materials,

540
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,850
manufacturing processes,
internal and external sensing.

541
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,410
So the types of payloads

542
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,440
and the types of things that
they need are roughly similar,

543
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,241
but the exact details of the
challenges associated with them

544
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,413
will vary from one to another.

545
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,570
And I'll just mention that, you know,

546
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,370
satellite isn't a monolithic term.

547
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,900
Neither is hypersonic flight.

548
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,670
There's many different
classes of satellites,

549
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,890
there's many different
satellite orbital bands,

550
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,240
there's new ones coming online

551
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,890
that I'll talk about in a minute.

552
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,000
Same for hypersonic.

553
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,820
There's multiple hypersonic missions,

554
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,750
multiple vehicle bodies,
multiple, you know,

555
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,750
offensive, defensive, surveillance,

556
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,980
all different types of things.

557
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,810
There's talk about hypersonic vehicles

558
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,660
replacing satellites at some point.

559
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,320
So you know, inside each
of those two categories

560
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,150
you see lots and lots of variation
in what needs to be done.

561
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,040
But at a high level,
those are the two areas

562
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,583
where I'm focused on delivering
state-of-art technology.

563
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,730
About hypersonic flight.

564
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,140
Hypersonic is a term, roughly
means to traveling Mach 5

565
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,895
or a mile a second or faster.

566
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:26,460
This is something that's been

567
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,250
of increasing importance
over the last couple years.

568
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,480
You probably see a lot of talk

569
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,270
about hypersonic capability in the press.

570
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,720
It's not a capability
that the US has alone,

571
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,610
it's not unique to us is what I'm saying.

572
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,550
It's something where other countries

573
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,350
are developing this at a very fast basis,

574
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,630
and we are as well.

575
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,750
And I think in terms of priorities,

576
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,190
that there are government lists,

577
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,110
microelectronics and hypersonics

578
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,240
are number one and number two.

579
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,860
They trade places time and time again.

580
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,860
But I believe last time I
checked, that was the ranking.

581
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,800
So what are some of the
challenges of hypersonics?

582
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,420
At that speed

583
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,650
you're going to experience
temperatures on your surface

584
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,633
in excess of 1000 C.

585
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,660
There are points where that is higher

586
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,670
and there's points where it's lower.

587
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,520
I can tell you from some of
the things I'm working on

588
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,549
that it's higher

589
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:25,170
if you're anywhere in
this nose cone region here

590
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,210
up until about the yellow ring there.

591
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,360
And even inside, underneath
all of your thermal protection

592
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,190
and heat sinks and everything like that,

593
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,333
you're still looking at operating
temperatures around 500 C.

594
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,159
I could tell you that mil
spec electronic standards

595
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,463
are maxed out at 200 C.

596
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,020
So we're talking about
putting things in places

597
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,943
that they're not meant to survive in.

598
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,910
So that's a major challenge.

599
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,570
And commercial companies don't want to say

600
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,310
that they can operate in those conditions.

601
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,620
They don't want to supply
you if you tell them

602
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,730
that you're operating on those conditions,

603
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,653
because there's no guarantee on how well

604
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:06,510
the devices will perform.

605
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,250
In fact, most thermal models

606
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:13,250
for electronics in those
conditions tap out at 200 C.

607
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,980
So you see the same
performance predictions

608
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,020
at 300 C and 400 C as you would at 200 C

609
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,473
because they just stop, you
know, modeling after that point.

610
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,350
So this has been
something we've discovered

611
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,828
and we're working on.

612
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:28,980
There's benefits of having the ability

613
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,246
to put things like sensors

614
00:28:30,246 --> 00:28:33,682
and compute capability in
those parts of the vehicle

615
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:36,630
versus having to put them
near the back of the vehicle

616
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,463
where it's cooler,

617
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:40,560
or having to surround them with
massive titanium heat sinks

618
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,810
that add weight and affect the performance

619
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,160
of the vehicles themselves.

620
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,305
Another challenge

621
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:48,990
is that you're gonna
generate a plasma field

622
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,190
when you're traveling that fast.

623
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,849
You're gonna have all
these ionized particles

624
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:55,920
surrounding your vehicle
and making a sheath.

625
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,840
And that can interfere with your ability

626
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,573
to do things like infrared sensing,

627
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,960
RF communications.

628
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,980
So you can go blind in
terms of your navigation.

629
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,840
You can go blind in terms of communication

630
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,340
with other assets.

631
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,820
And you lose the ability to
sense in certain spectrums.

632
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,160
So there's a lot of work
going into figuring out

633
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,360
how you mitigate that

634
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,510
either from a signal correction standpoint

635
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,720
or possibly even just
mitigating the plasma field

636
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,370
at certain points,

637
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,013
weakening it so that you
can communicate through it.

638
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,910
Ablation and phase change.

639
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,910
So material really starts to
fall apart at those speeds

640
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,470
and at those temperatures.

641
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,350
And you see more and more investment

642
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,520
going into metallic alloys
and manufacturing processes

643
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,050
that can withstand those
temperatures without ablating.

644
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,000
You start to see problems in joints.

645
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,770
So if you don't make your
vehicle air shell monolithically,

646
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,100
those bond points where one
part overlaps with another

647
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,180
are vulnerabilities.

648
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,940
So we're looking at ways
of shoring those up.

649
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,580
And we're looking at new
materials for things like radomes

650
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,280
that allow you to
integrate more seamlessly

651
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,990
so you don't have weak points.

652
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,630
And those materials themselves
have to also be able

653
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,000
to withstand those extreme conditions,

654
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,773
and that has been problematic.

655
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,300
Some of the areas where the
innovations are happening,

656
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,270
in summary, microelectronics,
metal alloys.

657
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,470
So we're actively looking at
new species of metal alloys

658
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,370
that can meet both the extreme temperature

659
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,650
and extreme environment conditions,

660
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:38,490
but also are scalable for
additive manufacturing processes.

661
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,420
So it's as much a logistical challenge

662
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,073
as it is a technology challenge.

663
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,660
And then things like
sensors, piezoelectrics,

664
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,830
they're all being looked at.

665
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,750
Energy harvesting is a big one right now

666
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,160
because you have all that heat,

667
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,823
you might as well figure out
some way to put it to use.

668
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,890
This one just talks a little
more detail about sensors,

669
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,130
communications, airframes, and simulation.

670
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,020
So I think I touched on all these.

671
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,430
There's a little bit here about why

672
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,930
each one of 'em is important.

673
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,790
So I mentioned putting sensors in places

674
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,620
that are extremely hot.

675
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,870
This really boils down to the ability

676
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,210
to track moving objects

677
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,690
and to have higher fidelity
on your own positioning.

678
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,620
And specifically when you're
not gonna be able to use GPS,

679
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,510
which could be caused by
environmental conditions

680
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,160
or manmade conditions.

681
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,310
But the more you can
look where you're going,

682
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,920
which requires you to be
in very hot environments,

683
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,130
the better off you are in
performing your mission.

684
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,230
If you have to look backwards or sideways

685
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,420
or you have to do turnarounds
and things like that

686
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,992
to see what you're trying to do,

687
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:43,563
it compromises your ability to perform.

688
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,850
Communications, again, the plasma fields

689
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,990
and human effects,
jamming, things like that.

690
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,480
We have to be able to be self-sufficient

691
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,410
in terms of navigation and IMU capability,

692
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,510
higher precision, things like that.

693
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,650
So this is another area

694
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,770
where a lot of investment is being made

695
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,450
and a lot of calculations are being made

696
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,790
about what kind of
capabilities are needed,

697
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,370
what thresholds have to
be overcome, et cetera.

698
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,120
And we have some partnership
activities going on there.

699
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,790
Airframes, right now

700
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,040
a lot of carbon-carbon
materials being utilized

701
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,470
because of its thermal performance.

702
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,650
But there are limitations in how quickly

703
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:29,040
and cost-effectively you can
produce using carbon-carbon.

704
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,490
It's known that metallics are much better

705
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,030
for scalable 3D manufacturing,

706
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,580
but there are some challenges around

707
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,220
the characteristics of some

708
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,563
of the more readily available alloys.

709
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,990
There's also some,

710
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,540
this is more forward thinking
and strategic than tactical,

711
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,890
but there's some challenges around

712
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,680
where certain alloy
materials are sourced from

713
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,260
and whether that could
or couldn't be a problem

714
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,550
in the future based on some
geopolitical conflicts.

715
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,200
So all these things get factored in.

716
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,290
We wanna make sure that
in a worst case scenario

717
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,580
the United States has the ability

718
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,760
to manufacture the
hypersonic aircraft it needs

719
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,170
to perform to spec

720
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:14,520
and without any kind of
supply chain shock or hiccups

721
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,283
that would throw a wrench
in the whole thing.

722
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,640
The last one here I didn't talk about yet,

723
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,920
but I think it's maybe
one of the most important,

724
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,490
and I see this a lot with my team, is that

725
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,000
we make all this progress on a technology

726
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,350
and we get to a point where we need

727
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,960
to test it in a relevant environment.

728
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,410
And then we wait and we wait and we wait.

729
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,760
And then we pay a lot of money

730
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,250
and we do a test and we get
a little bit of data back

731
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,581
and we're not satisfied,

732
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:46,650
then we wait and we wait and
we wait and we do it again.

733
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,960
And this is because the ability

734
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,810
to test in relevant
environments and in situ

735
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,035
is a bottleneck.

736
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:56,220
And the rate of technology development

737
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,180
far outpaces the supply
of testing capabilities.

738
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,550
And the reason we can't do
what we do in other fields,

739
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,490
which is just offload some
of that early validation work

740
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,490
to simulation, is because the
fidelity of hypersonic models,

741
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,760
multiphysics models

742
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,310
and specifically
computational fluid dynamics,

743
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,250
doesn't allow us to get
the fidelity we need

744
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,810
to make that triage.

745
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,360
We have to do real world testing.

746
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,280
And if we could overcome that,

747
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,320
then we could more effectively triage

748
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,020
which technologies move forward,

749
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,730
and we could cut the queue down

750
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,700
for these testing
infrastructures from, you know,

751
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,630
something very large

752
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,930
to something much more
compact and manageable.

753
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,020
I think this is a major
area that the industry

754
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,640
has to be investing in

755
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,610
at the same time that the
government is taking action

756
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,800
to increase the supply
of testing capability.

757
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,850
So we're approaching it from
both a supply and demand angle.

758
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,683
But I think having

759
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:53,480
that higher fidelity simulation capability

760
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,893
will pay many dividends for the industry.

761
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,100
This is another interesting one

762
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,470
I wanna talk a little bit about.

763
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,210
This is on the satellite side.

764
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:10,140
So for many reasons, both the practicality

765
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,500
of operating at lower orbital altitudes

766
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,020
and some of the challenges
that are emerging,

767
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,783
things like space debris
becoming a problem.

768
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,480
We're seeing a push to move

769
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,480
to a new orbital band
called VLEO or very low LEO.

770
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,270
LEO stands for low earth observation.

771
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,210
These are the lowest
flying satellites in space.

772
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,190
And they're usually the
ones that are doing things

773
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,020
like remote imaging

774
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,030
and taking pictures of the
Earth, things like that

775
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,663
because their altitude allows
them higher image resolution.

776
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,660
450 kilometers, 350, 450
is like the rough range

777
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,450
that this new VLEO band would operate at.

778
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,210
And it's kinda in that gray
area of, it's not quite space,

779
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,190
it's not quite the atmosphere.

780
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,620
So this one's really fascinating

781
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,410
because your traditional satellite,

782
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,200
like this one I have here
that is like a flying box

783
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,620
with solar panels won't
survive in that environment,

784
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,140
because there's so much atmospheric drag

785
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,093
that it needs to be more aerodynamic.

786
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:12,510
And there's a high
concentration of atomic oxygen

787
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,970
that leads to really fast corrosion.

788
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,830
So if you put something
like a traditional satellite

789
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,170
in this orbit, it would just destabilize

790
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,700
and de-orbit very quickly.

791
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,470
And if somehow it didn't do that,

792
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,940
the payloads would start corroding

793
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,730
and it would become useless very quickly.

794
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,540
So fortunately for
things in this low orbit,

795
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,790
the operating model is more charitable.

796
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,097
So they don't have to survive 10, 15 years

797
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:38,220
in extreme radiated space.

798
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,640
They can survive for a few
years and be smaller and cheaper

799
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,860
and we can put up new ones for less money,

800
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,760
because, you know, to go
to higher altitude orbits

801
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,550
requires more fuel, and
basically your launch costs

802
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,260
are just significantly higher.

803
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,040
But that doesn't solve
the problem of being fit

804
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,540
to operate in those environments.

805
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,960
So we're looking at things like
how do you build a satellite

806
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,470
that looks more like an
aircraft and is aerodynamic

807
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,360
and has enough thrust

808
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,980
to maintain orbit in a dense atmosphere?

809
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,800
Traditional electronic
propulsion from solar

810
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,480
on satellites won't cut it.

811
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,110
So we're looking at different
methods of doing that.

812
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,560
How do you mitigate the
extreme corrosive effects?

813
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
How do you deal with higher electron flux

814
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,650
which messes with your instrumentation?

815
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,200
It also messes with your drag profile,

816
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,680
your solar energy harvesting.

817
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,260
So there's a lot of things
that are changing the way,

818
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,360
it's not just satellites
in a different environment,

819
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,253
it's a whole new class of vehicle.

820
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,700
Here's some of the areas
I'm outlining for VLEO.

821
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,990
Propulsion, as I mentioned.

822
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,100
So something called

823
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,700
atmospheric breathing
electric propulsion or ABEP

824
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,020
is becoming prominent.

825
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,600
This hasn't traditionally
applied to aircraft,

826
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,800
it hasn't applied to satellites,

827
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,320
it's something specific to this domain.

828
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,360
And a lot of work is going into modeling

829
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,510
what the ideal payloads
are gonna look like,

830
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,910
what their size-weight
profiles are gonna be,

831
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,130
what their expected lifetimes are,

832
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,140
thrust performance, et cetera.

833
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,190
So we can understand how

834
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,673
to design a complex VLEO satellite system.

835
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,700
Aerodynamic control is another one.

836
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,950
So there's much more perturbation

837
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,410
that's gonna be incident
on these platforms

838
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,140
than in higher altitude bands.

839
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,794
So a traditional satellite
is not meant to have

840
00:38:30,794 --> 00:38:34,530
that level of fidelity
of attitude correction

841
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,090
and awareness of slight
perturbations in its orientation.

842
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,480
So we really need to up the
sensing game on these platforms

843
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,370
so that they can auto correct themselves,

844
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,380
they can detect a slight
change and correct it

845
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,810
before that change grows

846
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,430
and now they're off their orbital track

847
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,960
or they really get in trouble

848
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,213
to a point where it's not salvageable.

849
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,840
So you have things coming
off a satellite like antennas

850
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,470
and arms and solar arrays
and things like that

851
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,130
that are also very sensitive
to increases in drag

852
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,960
and can bend and snap and break.

853
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,660
So we have to be thoughtful about how we

854
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,450
interlay those payloads onto the aircraft.

855
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,070
One of the areas that my team works on

856
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,690
is flex hybrid electronics.

857
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,850
So taking something that's
traditionally a rigid structure

858
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,580
and making it flexible so
it can withstand more drag

859
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,070
and it can be conformed
around different parts

860
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,770
of the vehicle, maybe wrap
around the edges of the surface

861
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,690
that need to be more aerodynamic

862
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,408
and still perform as needed.

863
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:32,820
So a lot of changes going on there.

864
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,830
As well as the anti corrosion aspect.

865
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,200
So not only do you have
to resist the drag,

866
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,139
but you have to be able to survive

867
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:43,260
for the one to two year operating lifetime

868
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,420
without degradation.

869
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,780
And a lot of the laboratory
experiments we've seen

870
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,990
with atomic oxygen are, it's really nasty.

871
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,260
So understanding how we can either build

872
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,260
with different material or
coat with different material

873
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,560
to mitigate corrosion or
slow its effects to the point

874
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,350
where it's negligible
over a two year period

875
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,630
is gonna be extremely important.

876
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,120
Not only understanding what
those coatings might be,

877
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,643
but also how we apply
them in an effective way.

878
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,630
And then lastly, you know, you can tell

879
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,120
that this is something that
I'm really passionate about

880
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,290
is simulation again.

881
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,543
So anytime you operate
in a new environment,

882
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,750
you're gonna get so far and
then you're gonna hit a wall

883
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,470
because, as I mentioned, your
ability to test and qualify

884
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,750
is gonna be your rate limiting factor.

885
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,750
And the more you can apply
modeling and simulation

886
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,410
with sufficient fidelity

887
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,170
and you can explain the fidelity of that,

888
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,270
the faster you're gonna be
able to break through that wall

889
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,910
and you're gonna be able to
transition more technology.

890
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,960
I like to think that the people

891
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,840
who use the technology are
probably the biggest skeptics,

892
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,150
because they don't want to take any risk

893
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,760
because there's really high
stakes of what they do.

894
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,190
And the burden is on us to show them

895
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,340
that this new technology
not only meets their needs,

896
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,870
it doesn't compromise anything

897
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,480
and allows 'em to do things
they couldn't do today,

898
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,840
which keeps the platforms

899
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,650
and their stakeholders, if
there's humans involved,

900
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,480
in even better condition.

901
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,530
So the more we can pull
the thread from technology

902
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,690
through mission analysis
and show the outcome

903
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,680
and explain that outcome
based on the simulated,

904
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,870
the models that go into doing that,

905
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,270
the easier it's going to be.

906
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,400
I think I'm reaching the end here.

907
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,290
I just wanna talk a little bit about ways

908
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,750
to collaborate with Lockheed Martin.

909
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,400
So probably the easiest
way is to work with us

910
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,530
on government funded initiatives.

911
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,590
So the government constantly
puts out opportunities

912
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,890
to develop technologies,
to conduct basic research.

913
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,140
Everything from what we call 6.1,

914
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,640
which is fundamental research,

915
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,610
all the way through high
technology readiness,

916
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,560
so things that are ready
to go into production

917
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,654
and be fielded.

918
00:41:59,654 --> 00:42:01,020
There's different agencies

919
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,820
that focus on different parts of that.

920
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,620
But our job is to shepherd technologies

921
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,030
all the way through that process.

922
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,920
So on the lower TRL or tech
readiness level, we work a lot

923
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,964
with universities,

924
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:18,540
then we work with small
businesses that are trying

925
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,370
to mature technology,

926
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,490
then we work with commercial
companies that have matured it

927
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,470
and are trying to put
it into manufacturing,

928
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,240
high volume manufacturing.

929
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,030
And then we work as systems
integrators on the backend

930
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,400
to figure out how these
piece parts come together

931
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,403
to form the components
of a larger apparatus.

932
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,390
So the DOD, NASA,

933
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,300
now the Department of
Commerce with the CHIPS Act

934
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,020
all have solicitations that
come out throughout the year.

935
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,470
And Lockheed Martin as
a defense contractor

936
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,750
understands federal
acquisition requirements.

937
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,010
We understand the language

938
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:56,100
and the contracting modalities
that the government uses.

939
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,790
And we are usually there
to lead those efforts.

940
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,010
But we don't do all the
performance ourselves,

941
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,131
we partner.

942
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:06,750
So we are always open to collaboration.

943
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,490
And we do countless engagements
with business every week

944
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,980
to understand what they're trying to do,

945
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,100
what the technologies are,
what value they create.

946
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,650
And if we have a winning
opportunity there,

947
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,560
we know that it aligns to
something the government needs,

948
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,720
we're very active in
partnering to pursue some

949
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,523
of these research opportunities.

950
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,020
The other, for larger
companies, is to shape

951
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,150
what we call Joint Technology
Development Agreements

952
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,770
or JDTAs.

953
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,627
This is something to do with some

954
00:43:35,627 --> 00:43:39,030
of the like, larger companies
like Microsoft or Global

955
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,290
where we spend a lot of time talking about

956
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,060
what we want, what they want,

957
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,510
what our win-win
scenarios might look like,

958
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,750
and how we message that,
how we deploy capital

959
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,270
to make those common interests possible.

960
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,150
These are a lot harder to stand up,

961
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,690
but when we do them right,
they have huge power

962
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,273
to change the way technology is deployed.

963
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:08,580
So I doubt that's gonna
apply to many people here.

964
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,500
But that is another way

965
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,143
that we are focusing
heavily on partnerships.

966
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,280
SBIR, STTR, these are the
small business opportunities.

967
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,110
So these are ones where Lockheed

968
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,000
actually can't participate directly

969
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,550
'cause they're specifically
for small businesses.

970
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,740
But we have a very large
apparatus to advocate

971
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,120
for small businesses.

972
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,890
Many of our suppliers
are small businesses.

973
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,410
Many of the unique
technologies that we work with

974
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,240
come out of small businesses.

975
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,230
And we are very active at
providing letters of support,

976
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,650
being minor performers on
small business-led pursuits

977
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,260
and contracts, where we
maybe do some testing

978
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,630
or we help evaluate a technology

979
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,060
and espouse on the relevance

980
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,790
of how this would help
support a larger system

981
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,580
or help support government missions.

982
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,650
So that one is very applicable, I suspect,

983
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,090
to a lot of folks here.

984
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,150
And we have people whose
sole job in the company

985
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,300
is to maintain portfolios
of small businesses

986
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,530
which we support

987
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,320
and monitor for future
supply chain integration.

988
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,410
So that is, I would encourage
anyone here to reach out,

989
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,560
if you have a small business,
you support a small business,

990
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,190
and you're looking for ways
of aligning more closely

991
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,953
with the primes in the defense industry.

992
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,110
That's not unique to Lockheed,

993
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,180
that's something that the
entire defense industry

994
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,190
has made a point of supporting.

995
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,580
And I know it's very important
to our government as well

996
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,190
that the large companies
support the small companies

997
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,823
and help usher them along and
pull the technology along.

998
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,180
And then finally, as university research.

999
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,510
So MIT has been a longstanding
partner of Lockheed Martin.

1000
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,120
We have our University Research Initiative

1001
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,640
that is funded annually.

1002
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,210
We also have a few other, that's
a corporate led initiative.

1003
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,040
We also have some of the business area-led

1004
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,870
university initiatives.

1005
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,160
These are just standing programs

1006
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,730
where we allocate research
money to university efforts.

1007
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,460
And then you have specific
programs that are more ad hoc,

1008
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,370
when, you know, they need
a technology for program X

1009
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:07,380
and it's coming out of a university,

1010
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,670
they can just go directly fund

1011
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,800
research and development there.

1012
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,820
But this makes up a major
part of our R&D backbone.

1013
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,820
And it is one that Lockheed
takes a lot of pride in.

1014
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,840
I mentioned I've been around for a while.

1015
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,016
When I first started here

1016
00:46:23,016 --> 00:46:27,600
was the Nano Initiative and
the MIT Energy Initiative.

1017
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,020
Since then I've done work
in artificial intelligence

1018
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,410
and with CSAIL and some of
the other groups out of MIT.

1019
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:39,030
Now working with the
folks like Tomas Palacios

1020
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,810
and Brian Wardle on materials
and microelectronics

1021
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,780
and now being part of MIT.nano.

1022
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,020
So where Lockheed is focusing

1023
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,850
at different points in time changes.

1024
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,040
But knowing that we
have a partner like MIT

1025
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,390
is something that we maintain

1026
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,243
a consistent level of participation in.

1027
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,740
So, and I'll end on that note.

1028
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,850
You know, my team and my
colleagues at corporate

1029
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,520
are really excited about
being part of MIT.nano.

1030
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,300
And we see it as a catalyst
for even broader collaboration

1031
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,280
on all those different modalities

1032
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,680
that I just mentioned there.

1033
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:19,260
So with that, I'd like to thank everybody

1034
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,130
for putting up with me for
the last 40 minutes or so.

1035
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,830
Hopefully you learned
something interesting here,

1036
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,650
or if you didn't, just enjoyed the time.

1037
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,800
And if you have any questions,
I'm happy to field them now.

1038
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,183
Thank you.
(audience applauding)

1039
00:47:36,868 --> 00:47:39,429
- So any questions for Keith?

1040
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:40,621
- I saw a hand there.
- Yes, please.

1041
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:42,210
- So I have a question about the shortage

1042
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:45,270
of actual testing facilities
that you described.

1043
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,040
And what is that arising from

1044
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,210
and what's the solution to that?

1045
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,190
I would think that that would
be a really high priority

1046
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,050
for Lockheed Martin to fund that,

1047
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,220
'cause that's really the bottleneck

1048
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,390
getting something to market.

1049
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,920
So I was just curious about that.

1050
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,880
- Yeah, hypersonics have not
traditionally been an area

1051
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,230
where, I mean, it's
pretty much a new domain.

1052
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:08,130
So a lot of the
longstanding test facilities

1053
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,470
that you see at national
laboratories, things like that,

1054
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,910
are not oriented for that.

1055
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,550
Some of them are, we have
like high speed sled testing,

1056
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,790
and you can do some laboratory replication

1057
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,623
of the environments,

1058
00:48:18,623 --> 00:48:21,420
but it was never designed
specifically for that.

1059
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,940
And now all of a sudden it's
a domain everyone cares about

1060
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,563
and we can't innovate fast enough.

1061
00:48:25,563 --> 00:48:28,743
So the demand is outpacing the supply.

1062
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,943
Same thing for in situ testing.

1063
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,480
You know, we're developing the platforms

1064
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,490
to travel at hypersonic speed.

1065
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,420
At the same time,

1066
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,120
we're developing additional
hypersonic platforms

1067
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,520
to test the things that
go into the other ones.

1068
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,030
So it's kinda like, you have
to innovate on your measurement

1069
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,270
at the same time you're
innovating on your solution,

1070
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,760
which is why the government
is investing pretty heavily

1071
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,200
in things like sounding rockets

1072
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,840
that are surrogates for hypersonic flight.

1073
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,350
And there is a lot of
investment going into updating

1074
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,580
and refreshing, expanding

1075
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,430
those lab infrastructure capabilities

1076
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,293
so that the supply catches up.

1077
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,430
- Other questions?

1078
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,008
- Thank you, this was such
a great talk and overview.

1079
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:18,720
- [Moderator] One second, sorry.

1080
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,680
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1081
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,513
Yes.

1082
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,720
- Yeah, thank you for the
great talk and overview.

1083
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,290
I was curious, so you mentioned,

1084
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,090
like high temperature microelectronics

1085
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,090
being used in hypersonic
and other applications.

1086
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,100
And in those situations you have,

1087
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,180
some of the integrated circuits

1088
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,130
aren't designed for that temperature.

1089
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,130
So do you feel that there's
any one particular area

1090
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,120
that's of focus?

1091
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,250
Is it the power amplifier,
is it the sensor?

1092
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,070
Do you think it just needs
an entire reevaluation

1093
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,250
across all the materials and devices?

1094
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,510
- We're looking at all of them.

1095
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,520
So the low hanging fruit I would say

1096
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,700
is the analog components.

1097
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,060
So things that are sending
and receiving signals.

1098
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,030
It's more most advantageous
to have those at the point

1099
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:06,000
where they can have
the best field of view.

1100
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,080
You know, if they're communicating

1101
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,310
or sensing another asset, you
want to have them unimpeded.

1102
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,950
'Cause if they're are impeded, you know,

1103
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,800
I'm trying to sense you, but
I can only look over here,

1104
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,290
then I have to turn to look at you,

1105
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,230
which creates problems basically.

1106
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,530
So it makes my profile bigger,
it throws me off my course,

1107
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,320
I burn more fuel, all
kinds of things like that.

1108
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,609
So those RF components
are low hanging fruit.

1109
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:34,260
But there's a lot of work,

1110
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,770
as you start developing that
system and designing it,

1111
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,350
you know, okay, the power
amplifiers are okay,

1112
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,244
low noise amplifiers, high
noise amplifiers, switches.

1113
00:50:43,244 --> 00:50:46,110
Now you're trying to
take that analog signal

1114
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,560
and convert it to digital
signal and do some calculation.

1115
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,130
Now you have extreme noise
from the heat over your lines

1116
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,200
so you're looking at better cabling.

1117
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,390
Then you're looking at your mixing

1118
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,010
and everything on the back end, right?

1119
00:50:59,010 --> 00:50:59,843
And you start to think,

1120
00:50:59,843 --> 00:51:01,410
well, what if I pulled
more of that forward?

1121
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,840
Then I don't have to send
signal over a long cable

1122
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,600
where I have more noise incursion, right?

1123
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,090
So very quickly you go
from the low hanging fruit

1124
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:10,860
to realizing this would
be even better if I pulled

1125
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,560
more of that digital mixed
signal stuff upfront too.

1126
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,870
So we can't just focus on that.

1127
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:19,500
We have to look at the
entire microelectronic chain,

1128
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,633
and then figure out what
the optimal distribution

1129
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:25,110
from a geographic location
perspective is on the vehicle,

1130
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,230
and then innovate to make that possible.

1131
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,870
And then in parallel to that,
you know, the power devices

1132
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,720
and actuation devices,

1133
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,270
we're also running the
models right now to show

1134
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,730
that these are gonna become bottlenecks.

1135
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,740
So those are being developed in parallel

1136
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,660
even though they're separate
from that sensing chain

1137
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,010
that I just talked about.

1138
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:48,180
So it's one of those things where I feel,

1139
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,960
from my perspective, I see
a lot of parties waking up

1140
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,000
to this challenge at the same time.

1141
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,250
And some of them are gonna
rally around the thing

1142
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,930
that is their core competency.

1143
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,210
So you might have RF groups
rallying around that,

1144
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,310
power device groups rallying around that.

1145
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,183
And that's great.

1146
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:05,520
We're trying to take the perspective of,

1147
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,590
we're standing on the
hill seeing all of it

1148
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,990
and we're trying to bring
all the pieces together

1149
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,659
to make sure the things
people are focusing on

1150
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:13,590
come together holistically

1151
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,783
to help us reach that end solution state.

1152
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:25,380
- I do wanna ask whether
AAA applies on the moon

1153
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,960
if you're renting a car.
(Keith chuckling)

1154
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,310
It could be for afterwards.

1155
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,590
We have a lot of startups around
MIT.nano where I, you know,

1156
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,670
I work with Vladimir.

1157
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,170
And I'm curious if you
could expand a little bit

1158
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,750
upon what criteria
maybe you're looking at,

1159
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,920
if you were writing letters of support,

1160
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,870
what that might mean, in case
there's anybody in the room

1161
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,940
who would be interested in that.

1162
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,740
I thought a little more detail
might help us understand

1163
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,680
when to approach Lockheed
about an opportunity.

1164
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,370
- Yeah, so the one challenge

1165
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,940
that we see the most with
working with small businesses,

1166
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,830
working with commercial
businesses in general,

1167
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,690
because of the nature
of the defense industry

1168
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,250
is we have to make sure that

1169
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:06,510
there aren't export control
issues around something.

1170
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,280
So if you're working on a technology

1171
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:13,280
and you don't have a
workforce with US citizens

1172
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,660
that can work on things that
are potentially classified

1173
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:20,250
or sensitive, that is
gonna be a problem for us.

1174
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,270
So there are certain things

1175
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,540
where we just need US
nationals supporting it.

1176
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,090
This is purely mandated
from the government.

1177
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:31,260
It's from a potential security standpoint.

1178
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,900
So we're just following guidelines there.

1179
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,660
But in a lot of cases we
do work with companies

1180
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,870
where there are certain
subsets of the workforce

1181
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,360
who can work with us on
specific applications.

1182
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,320
And that's fine.

1183
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,430
We just work with 'em to make sure

1184
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,320
that the right firewalls are in place.

1185
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,540
I would say that's the biggest hurdle

1186
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,430
or the biggest thing that would stop us

1187
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,610
from doing everything we want
to do with small businesses.

1188
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,640
But it's one that we often work around.

1189
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,320
And there's a couple companies

1190
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,963
we're talking to right now
that are MIT spin-outs.

1191
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,190
You know, we don't just
work across the board.

1192
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,520
We find specific things
that are applicable

1193
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,400
and we align the right
people on both sides,

1194
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,130
and then we can actually
start working together well.

1195
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,980
So I'd say taking the
time to figure that out

1196
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,310
and, you know, knowing, okay,
you want to approach Lockheed

1197
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:24,870
to talk about your technology
for hypersonics, right?

1198
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,880
Make sure that you can talk to us

1199
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,820
about how you can work
with us on that technology

1200
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,183
without violating any export
control or sensitivity issues.

1201
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,250
- Other questions?

1202
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,433
Other questions?

1203
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:43,740
A quick question on,

1204
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,170
you haven't mentioned
radiation-hardened electronics.

1205
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,970
I assume that's also an issue.

1206
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,680
- Yes. (laughing)

1207
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,993
Definitely an issue for space, absolutely.

1208
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,320
For strategic systems,

1209
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,130
so things that are domestic intercepts,

1210
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,830
things like that are also required too.

1211
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,790
Think about, like ICBM defense,

1212
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,500
missile defense capabilities,

1213
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,260
they have high radiation requirements.

1214
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,330
So it's not just space.

1215
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,733
But yeah, in my discipline
that's a big deal.

1216
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,530
So looking at doing radiation hardening

1217
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,823
by design is expensive and time consuming.

1218
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,220
So you have to build redundancies

1219
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,020
and things like that into
your hardware and software

1220
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,633
to mitigate radiation effects.

1221
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,930
If we could figure out how to do that

1222
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,280
on the packaging scale,

1223
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,594
so your electronics stay as they are

1224
00:55:37,594 --> 00:55:39,360
but you just package them differently

1225
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:44,360
and the packaging stops
radiation from permeating,

1226
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,123
that would be huge.

1227
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:49,080
But we haven't cracked that nut yet.

1228
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,110
It's, you know, hasn't
substituted rad-hard by design

1229
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,313
or rad-hard by process.

1230
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,630
Same with thermal management.

1231
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:59,790
We're getting into a lot
of challenges with thermal.

1232
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,560
And thermal's traditionally addressed

1233
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,520
at the structural level,

1234
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,140
so you have heat pipes
and things like that

1235
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,823
that wick away heat.

1236
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,780
We're finding we have to move
more towards the packaging

1237
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,213
and the devices themselves,

1238
00:56:11,213 --> 00:56:14,940
processes and design changes
in the die of the electronics

1239
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,870
all meant to keep the
device from overheating

1240
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,229
or to efficiently move heat away

1241
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:22,950
so that it can continue to operate.

1242
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,660
Otherwise have to throttle down devices

1243
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,700
and we lose performance, so.

1244
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,210
- So if we could do electronics
without any semiconductors,

1245
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:31,043
that would be kind of good.

1246
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:32,970
- That would be ideal.
(both laughing)

1247
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,230
- We do have ideas.
- And you could

1248
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,310
produce them at scale.
(both laughing)

1249
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,203
- Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1250
00:56:38,302 --> 00:56:41,940
Last question, given the time,
we already spent a lot of it.

1251
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,210
So you mentioned one of
your favorite examples

1252
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,700
of how to utilize an offset,

1253
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,500
and how to engage in essentially

1254
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,840
any project at all possible,

1255
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,510
just to make sure that other businesses

1256
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,150
of Lockheed can indeed
do their performance.

1257
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,740
And you mentioned the cheese smuggling

1258
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,720
as being one of those specific ones.

1259
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,220
Any other ones come to mind?

1260
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,740
'Cause it does sound like the opportunity

1261
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,254
is completely open there.

1262
00:57:07,254 --> 00:57:10,230
If we can suggest to you
a fantastic technology,

1263
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,540
has nothing to do with any
of the ones you mentioned,

1264
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,690
that could be grown into
a business in some country

1265
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:19,560
that might be focusing
on cheese or otherwise.

1266
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,432
- Absolutely.

1267
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:25,432
It's one of my favorite
facets of Lockheed because it,

1268
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,200
you know, the door's
really open for anything,

1269
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,033
like you said.

1270
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:32,130
And some countries not so much, you know,

1271
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,790
their priority is if
we're gonna buy airplanes,

1272
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:38,430
we want to make parts of
those airplanes in-country.

1273
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:43,230
Others it's more, you
know, it's less specific

1274
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,310
to the thing they're buying.

1275
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,590
They just say, we really
care about desalination

1276
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,380
or we care about agriculture, aquaculture.

1277
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,050
So one of my other examples
is we actually created

1278
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,980
a spin-out called Forever
Oceans that was in, you know,

1279
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,170
we spun it out, our venture
fund invested in it.

1280
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,690
They did mobile aquaculture.

1281
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,810
So they would have these geodesic pens

1282
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,450
with GPS tracking technology,

1283
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,240
and they would put little
hatchling fish in them

1284
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,710
and they would set 'em
adrift in the ocean.

1285
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,480
They would follow the ocean gyres

1286
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,220
and make this large circle.

1287
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,160
And by the time they came back,
the fish were fully adults.

1288
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:17,993
And they found that

1289
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:19,980
by having them in the open ocean like that

1290
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,380
and with that high fidelity tracking,

1291
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,610
they were healthier fish.

1292
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,040
You know, there was, it was a big deal.

1293
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,900
And countries in the Middle East

1294
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,110
and southeast Asia were
really interested in this.

1295
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:34,170
So again, nothing to do with anything

1296
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,250
with our core business,

1297
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:39,390
but yeah, there's a lot of
opportunities like that.

1298
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,120
- How's the company doing now?
- They're doing great!

1299
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,530
Yeah.
(Vladimir laughing)

1300
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:44,897
I think they are a supplier to some

1301
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,890
of the really high end sushi,

1302
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,420
you know, like Nobu, place like that.

1303
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,063
So it sounds like they're doing great.

1304
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,330
And the CEO got to move out to Hawaii.

1305
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,236
And you know, what a hard life out there.

1306
00:58:57,236 --> 00:58:58,500
(Vladimir laughing)

1307
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,044
- Keith, thanks a ton.
- Yeah, thank you.

1308
00:59:01,044 --> 00:59:04,211
(audience applauding)
