00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:14,759
Hello. Uh, I'm Matt Carpenter and this

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:19,359
is this is Gaia AI. Uh, we are using uh

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,840
technology and sensors from uh our

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,320
team's time in autonomous vehicles and

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,279
uh applying that to build a forestry

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,279
management system from the ground up. So

7
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,800
forestry is a huge industry. It's

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,880
essential to the modern world and it

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,040
shows up everywhere in our daily lives

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,840
and it's getting broader all the time.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,559
Uh from carbon sequestration to managing

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,399
for biodiversity while also mitigating

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,040
the growing risks of wildfires. There's

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,840
a lot going on in this industry. Uh and

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,760
the industry is also based on data and

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
methods that are over a century old.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,680
Foresters going out into the field with

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
calipers and tape measures and this is

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,160
holding it

20
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:02,000
back. Our

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,840
system uses advanced algorithms like

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,799
SLAM AI specifically tailored for forest

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,600
environments to measure and map trees

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,159
below the canopy 100 times faster than

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,600
the current status

26
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:20,560
quo. We use this dense rich below canopy

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,680
data to train satellite imagery AI

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,880
algorithms to scale that information to

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,640
much broader areas.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,240
We've worked with a dozen forest

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
management companies and some of the

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,079
largest carbon project developers in the

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,000
United States. And we're excited to

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,240
share that in 2025, we're collaborating

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,200
with the US Forest Service to scale

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,759
wildfire risk management across the

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,799
country. Our data is uniquely positioned

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,680
to measure fuel load on the forest

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,320
floor, which is an essential missing

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,399
piece to solving the wildfire crisis.

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
And this is the same information that's

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,280
necessary to evaluate the risk to homes,

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,719
utilities, and

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,119
properties, which also assists in

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,479
solving the forest or the fire man uh

46
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,080
insurance crisis as

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,480
well. Our AI will power the next

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
generation of carbon credits, wildfire

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,520
insurance, and nature finance. for

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,520
carbon credits. We will measure the

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,319
biomass within the forest as well as

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
proving additionality and also helping

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,440
forest managers understand the

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
trade-offs involved with participation

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,239
in carbon markets. For wildfire risk, we

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
measure both the uh the fuel load on the

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,480
forest floor, but also the height of the

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
canopy, which are the two main factors

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,239
determining the risk of extreme

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,200
wildfires. And for nature finance, we

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,000
will measure a wide variety of

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,239
biodiversity metrics, helping assess and

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,239
manage supply chains in an ever evolving

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,599
policy landscape around natural

65
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,680
assets. We've built the world's best

66
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,680
data collection system for this market.

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Specifically designed to integrate with

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
our customers existing workflows. We

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,360
have a lightweight backpack for data

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,319
capture in the field, a mobile app that

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,200
allows for navigation and feedback, and

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,879
a web application for planning and data

73
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,879
analytics. This system allows our

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,959
customers to overcome the limitations of

75
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
the shrinking labor pool willing and

76
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,239
able to take on forestry fieldwork while

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,799
gaining the advantages associated with

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,799
precision agriculture.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,200
If you're interested in using AI to

80
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,080
improve how we manage our forests for

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,239
carbon credits, wildfire mitigation, and

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
nature finance, we'd love to chat,

83
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,720
particularly with insurance companies

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,879
impacted by wildfires and sustainability

85
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,440
teams interested in building large

86
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,439
quantities of highquality carbon

87
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,840
credits. Thank you.

88
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,840
Thank you, Matt.
