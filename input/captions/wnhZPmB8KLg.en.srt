1
00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:03,358
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:09,780
- When I was a child,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,270
we got Scientific American every month,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,010
and I read a lot of the articles in it,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,080
but one thing that really fascinated me

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,110
was this column by Martin Gardner called,

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,020
Mathematical Games that
he had every month.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,190
And I was really very taken by it.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,660
As an undergrad at Caltech,

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,794
I took a lot of quantum physics.

11
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:32,970
It was either two or
three semesters of it,

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,370
that's because I was thinking
of becoming a physics major,

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,390
but I did not like lab
courses enough to do it.

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,440
So I became a math major instead.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,740
But you know, that really,

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,480
I guess, introduced me
to quantum mechanics,

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,600
and got me thinking
about quantum mechanics.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,890
And when I got to MIT,

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,450
I took a lot of different courses.

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,650
I took Algorithms and Cryptography,

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,540
and Number Theory,

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,430
really, you needed all of these courses

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,530
to discover the factoring algorithms.

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,020
So you needed some
things from mathematics,

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,430
some things from computer science,

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,230
and some things from physics.

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,990
I was taking courses because
I was interested in them,

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,282
not because I thought they would be

29
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,460
ultimately useful for something,

30
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,591
led me to discover this quantum,

31
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:21,120
this quantum factoring algorithm.

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,670
The first time I started
thinking seriously

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,110
about quantum computing

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,600
was after I saw Umesh Vazirani

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,670
give a talk at Bell Labs,

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,530
and I started thinking about

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,800
quantum computing at that
time, I didn't tell anybody.

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,860
And then the next thing that happened

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,028
was I saw Dan Simon's paper about

40
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:43,770
his algorithm for solving Simon's problem,

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,930
which is another contrived problem

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,970
that quantum computers can do faster

43
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,800
than classical computers.

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,903
But this one was really,

45
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,380
I wanna say this was really
kind of like a blueprint

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,471
for the factoring algorithm,

47
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:02,370
then figured out how to
do Fourier transforms

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,370
over Z mod P,

49
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,490
where P's a smooth number
on a quantum computer.

50
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,764
And then I think I got up
in the middle of the night

51
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,217
and scribbled some stuff down,

52
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,190
and that gave me a discreet log algorithm

53
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,370
for primes that are one larger,

54
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,830
where P minus one is smooth.

55
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,060
And so a smooth number is one

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,619
that has a lot of small factors.

57
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:29,970
So I had a factoring
algorithm for smooth numbers.

58
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,840
This algorithm was so different
from the classical algorithm

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,450
that I think I, you know,

60
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,970
it encouraged me rather
than discouraging me

61
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,280
I played around with it quite a bit more,

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,240
and I figured out how to use

63
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,110
the Fourier transform
for P when P was smooth

64
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,650
to factor to find the
discrete log for any number.

65
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,000
I mean, that was great.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,530
That was, I could solve something

67
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,090
with a quantum computer

68
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,234
that you can't solve with
a classical computer.

69
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:02,803
And it was, you know,

70
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:04,110
a very important problem,

71
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,610
because discreet logs are
used for crypto systems.

72
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,240
I used to work on algorithm for
problems in computer science

73
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,790
and now I work on quantum computing,

74
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,010
so it's changed direction.

75
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,210
I still kept working

76
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,970
on traditional computer science algorithms

77
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,590
for a few years after

78
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,120
the factoring algorithm was discovered.

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,640
But then I started doing more and more

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,170
just quantum computing.

81
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,710
And I guess the first thing
I did after quantum computing

82
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,390
was quantum error correction.

83
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,860
Without error correction,

84
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,890
you can't get very far
on a quantum computer.

85
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,470
My algorithm has completely
changed cryptography

86
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,037
because cryptographers
now know that the RSA

87
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:45,060
and Diffie-Hellman,

88
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,620
and the old crypto systems

89
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,410
is based on discrete log and factoring

90
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,060
are not necessarily going
to be secure for ever.

91
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,310
So they're trying to come up with

92
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,920
quantum resistant crypto systems,

93
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,730
and this has been an
immense area of research.

94
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,740
We would really like to
make these crypto systems

95
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,370
as efficient as possible without,

96
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,070
you know, compromising them,

97
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,550
and I really don't think
they know how to do that yet.

98
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,430
So there's going to be a
lot more research on these.

99
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,510
This is my office.

100
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,340
I do a lot of things here.

101
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,580
I work with students, I meet students,

102
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,230
I work on my computer,

103
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,800
writing papers and doing calculations.

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,550
I'm going to describe the steps
in the factoring algorithm.

105
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,020
I'm not gonna explain why they work,

106
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,420
because that would take
a really long time.

107
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,780
But, so what do you do?

108
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, there's a part that
you do on a quantum computer,

109
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,560
and then there's post-processing

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,810
that you do on a classical computer.

111
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,250
And the factoring algorithm,

112
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,220
you want to find

113
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,050
P x Q = N.

114
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,670
So you're given N,

115
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,130
and you wanna find two primes

116
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,543
that multiply to N.

117
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,310
And start with

118
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,973
two quantum registers.

119
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:17,148
(chalk scratching on board)

120
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:19,440
And these are just basically registers

121
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,270
that are supervision of numbers.

122
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,323
The first one,

123
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,850
so the first one has 2L qubits

124
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,013
and the second one has L qubits.

125
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,850
And you start the first register,

126
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,800
well you start them all

127
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,800
in say zero.

128
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,870
So every qubit is in the state zero.

129
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,260
And now what you do is
you apply a transformation

130
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,973
that takes this state to
one over two zero plus one,

131
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,233
to the 2L.

132
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,510
And now this is the same as

133
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,350
summation over I = 10 through two

134
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,153
to the 2L - 1.

135
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,210
I'm sorry,

136
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,000
I with one over two to the L

137
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,143
normalization factor
in front of it is zero.

138
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,490
Now the next thing you do

139
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,370
is you choose a random number X.

140
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,477
Well, I choose random X

141
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,513
with zero less than X, less than N.

142
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,230
And now you compute

143
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,030
X to the I

144
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,193
mod N in the second register.

145
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:59,384
(gentle music)
(chalk scratching on board)

146
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,280
And now what you do is you take

147
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,510
the quantum Fourier transform

148
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,972
of the first register,

149
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:10,555
(gentle music)

150
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,380
and you measure the first register,

151
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,793
and this will give you,

152
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,640
well this will give you a number,

153
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,370
but the wonderful link of the number

154
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,500
is that you can then take this number,

155
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,140
and do some post-processing on it.

156
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,450
So basically you do

157
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,420
continued fraction algorithm,

158
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,771
and it will give you

159
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,493
the factors of N if you're lucky.

160
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,760
Do I have any hobbies outside of work?

161
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,440
I like writing poetry,

162
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,560
and I posted a few of my poems on the web.

163
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,793
I like walking,

164
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,580
but we have a dog now

165
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,010
that I take on walks, generally every day,

166
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,710
she needs like two or
three walks each day.

167
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,790
And I like to read a lot.

168
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,214
I like science fiction especially,

169
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:11,310
but really I like pretty
much any kind of book.

170
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,320
I've had a very successful career.

171
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,460
Part of its success

172
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,060
is that I've chosen some very
difficult problems to work on

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,300
and I haven't solved
anywhere near all of them.

174
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,660
Maybe I've solved a third of
the really difficult problems

175
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,790
that I have worked on,

176
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,750
and you know, a third is actually enough.

177
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,610
But if I was giving advice
to a young researcher,

178
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,443
I would say,

179
00:08:36,443 --> 00:08:38,370
don't spend a hundred percent of your time

180
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,400
working on really difficult problems,

181
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,844
because if you don't solve them,

182
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:47,850
which is a very likely thing to happen,

183
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,120
then you have nothing to

184
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,260
show for your time.

185
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,400
But there's always a chance

186
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,080
you will solve a really difficult problem

187
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,693
and those are really,

188
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,490
you know, good for your career.

189
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,070
We keep finding new areas of mathematics

190
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,440
that can be used in quantum computing,

191
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,830
so don't hesitate to get
a really broad background,

192
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,073
even if you think it's
going to be irrelevant.
