we're using and the effects that it's

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,920
having at scale and more in particular

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,920
in in workplace outcomes.

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,719
So just for those who are not familiar

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,280

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,200
and I've been in the company for the

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
past eight years validating the platform

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,360
in different ways. So effectiveness,

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,920
cost effectiveness and different uh

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,280
other areas. uh as well and to the point

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,680
that you know this is one of the most

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
well validated interventions worldwide.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,200
We have more than 1.7 million uh users

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,280
across all the organizations health

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,840
systems pay providers we work with

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,080
worldwide and most in particular we have

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
presence in the UK, Ireland and in the

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,680
US.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
We don't do this alone obviously you

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,119
know and and we're very proud of the

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,680
partnership we've had over the past two

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,320
years with with the HSI with the work

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,840
with is Joe and and and an basically you

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,159
know through this work we are trying to

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,799
delve more into the data and really you

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,000
know uh find signals in the nose about

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,479
what makes this product uh to to work

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,880
and and finding the the best ways to to

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,399
use this information.

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
Today I want to talk you about you know

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,719
one particular partnership which is of

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,479
importance because this is the data that

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,159
my my colleague Brian will be talking

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
about later on as well which is

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,160
basically a partnership we have with the

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
national health service in Ireland

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,120
called the the HSSE the health service

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,120
executive the health service executive

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,040
is a national healthcare organization

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
for public health and social care

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,080
services in Ireland and it's free at the

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
point of contact for for I citizens and

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
people living in Ireland so in

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,720
partnership ship with the HSSE. In 2021,

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
we launched the LA National Digital CVT

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,040
service which basically had the aim of

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,959
making mental health support more widely

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,440
accessible in in Ireland. As we all

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,120
know, prevalences of mental health are

70
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,280
you know problems are on the rise and

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,360
this was a way to to address this this

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
problem for us in particular was an

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
exciting opportunity because also would

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,800
give us the opportunity to derive

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,959
important insights regarding service

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
delivery engagement and outcomes. Just

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
for you to get a sense of this service

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,200
delivery model. It's a prescription

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,040
only. So basically referrals may come

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
from primary care, primary care

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,640
physicians and then specialty care and

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,080
some charities. It's meant for

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,760
individuals with mild to moderate

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,560
presentation of the depression and

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
anxiety and it's offered with coaching

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,440
from a psychologist who trained in low

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,319
inensity interventions and they offer a

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
weekly reviews in a six to8 over over a

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,080
treatment course.

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
You can see here in terms of the most

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
used programs is mostly the anxiety

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
program and then the comorbid depression

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
and anxiety program and in terms of the

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,920
service utilization we are quite proud

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,760
in this partnership which is quite

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,599
unique in terms of like the the success

97
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
it's not the case for many of them and

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
I'm happy to talk more about you know

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
what what contributes to this uniqueness

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,799
of this partnership but you can see you

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,319
know that the volume of referrals is

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
very high you know and it has been

103
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,640
continuously growing over time only in

104
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,159
the last year to year from the December

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,319
24 report there an 18% growth from the

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,239
you know in yeartoear and the activation

107
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,519
rate which is basically users activating

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,519
the account is 67% which is very good at

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
an industry you know based on industry

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,439
standards and you can see that you know

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,360
primary care physicians are the highest

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,519
source of referrals so most of the

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,680
referrals are coming from from primary

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,480
care

115
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,720
in this um you know in our efforts to to

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,600
continuously do service evaluations we

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,440
have been sharing many reports with the

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
with the HSSE and they have been using

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,000
this information either to you know

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,320
inform the decisions around expanding

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,960
the model of care and adjusting

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,040
optimizing service delivery you know and

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
it has been very very useful in in this

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,759
regard. It also has shown some of the

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,919
outcomes that we're achieving. So 90% of

126
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,680
people who sign into the intervention

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,360
report positive expectations which

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
speaks about the quality of the the

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
referral by the by the physician. And

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,160
then when it comes to clinical outcomes,

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
we also see that 50% achieve reliable

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
recovery. This is people who start with

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
clinical levels of depression and

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,960
anxiety and transition to recovery by

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,600
the end of treatment. And most of them

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,680
are satisfied with the treatment. We

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
published some of the results already

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
two years ago on the one-year

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,440
evaluation. Happy to share this paper if

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,080
you want to know more about it after the

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
the talk. And today we just want to talk

142
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,759
about uh an internal piece of work we've

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,520
done. It's in review right now, so not

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,360
published yet. So take it with a pinch

145
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
of salt but basically we were asking the

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
question what are the indirect effects

147
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,840
of DTX for depression and anxiety on

148
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
workplace outcomes. So over the course

149
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,280
of one year we collected work related

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,680
outcomes on clients of this service. We

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,320
implemented a a validated measure called

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
the WPAI which basically measures

153
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
absentism presentism overall

154
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
productivity loss and activity

155
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,039
impairment alongside routinely collected

156
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,960
data on depression and anxiety. Here you

157
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,320
have a flowchart that basically displays

158
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,400
you know the people that was included

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,160
into this evaluation. We included the

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,080
full sample for all analysis which was

161
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
people who was employed at baseline and

162
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
it was around 7,000 clients.

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,280
This is a you know just a snapshot of

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,720
the sample characteristics. So 66% with

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,440
ages 18 to 44 70% female which is quite

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
consistent to what uh Joe was uh sharing

167
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
at the beginning. they are more willing

168
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
to to engage in these in these uh

169
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,520
offerings. Moderate levels of depression

170
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,840
and anxiety, 50% receiving concurrent

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,840
treatments. And then when it comes to uh

172
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,280
absentism, presentism and productivity

173
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
loss, you can see that it was quite

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,199
affected which is in line with people

175
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,960
having uh moderate depression and

176
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,960
anxiety.

177
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,639
So what were the key findings? So when

178
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,800
looking at the pre-post effects using

179
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
the the the overall sample, we saw that

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
over the treatment period, patients

181
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,479
demonstrated significant improvements

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,039
across the four constructs and the

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,120
effect sizes were going rang in the

184
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
small to medium effect size which is

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,400
quite good as an indirect effect and

186
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,319
these functional gains were also

187
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,120
positively linked with reductions in

188
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,120
depression and anxiety.

189
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
We tried to put a monetary value and it

190
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,600
was an estimation. So we basically used

191
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,440
a human capital approach to to um

192
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,880
estimate the the cost savings the

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,479
product productivity related cost

194
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,800
savings of this and for that we

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,960
leveraged the Irish national salary data

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880
stratified by education and gender. So

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
you can see that overall in terms of

198
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,120
productivity loss there was an 4,000

199
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,039
saving peranom per treated patient

200
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
overall. Obviously this is an estimation

201
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,960
but this is kind of what we are seeing

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,120
based on the treated sample. If we look

203
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,120
at clinical levels of depression versus

204
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,960
those who were with subclinical, we see

205
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,039
a huge difference. So basically those

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,680
with with clinical depression at

207
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,280
baseline were much likely to uh lead to

208
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,120
cost savings compared to those

209
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,280
subclinical. And this difference would

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,000
be even higher when it comes to clinical

211
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,800
anxiety versus subclinical where those

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,199
with clinical anxiety at baseline would

213
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,440
lead to lead to um higher cost savings.

214
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,199
All this together including all you know

215
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,080
from from this sample from this national

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,759
representative sample of 7,000 patients

217
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,800
equals uh you know around 29 29 million

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,280
um euros in in cost savings based on the

219
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,160
based on this improvements in workplace

220
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,160
uh productivity outcomes which is uh

221
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
quite of a cost savings. Obviously again

222
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,080
going back to the point that it's an

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,560
estimation but this is kind of like

224
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,560
aligned to what the literature is also

225
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,120
showing.

226
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,240
So just as a takeaway message from from

227
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,919
what we're sharing here. So DTX you know

228
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,919
can effectively improve workplace

229
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,520
functioning by attenuating symptoms of

230
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
depression and anxiety. Remember this

231
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,840
was you know offered at a national level

232
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,560
for people who was showing up for in

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,320
primary care and specialty care. But I

234
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,000
can't stress enough the importance of

235
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,560
adjusting a service for optimal

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,320
performance. This takes time and takes

237
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,640
uh resources, you know, to continue

238
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,720
finding how to make it more more

239
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,480
pleasant for for clinicians to refer and

240
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
all and all this. So, you know, this

241
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,519
this these results weren't there from

242
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
day one is the is what I'm trying to

243
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,680
say. Something that takes time, but if

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,519
you do this properly and you really work

245
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
on the integration, realizing the

246
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,399
potential of DTX at a scale may lead to

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,640
huge uh cost savings. So, I want to uh

248
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,279
leave it here and happy to answer any

249
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,279
question you may have. Thank you.

250
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,760
Thank thank you Anh Hill. So I I have

251
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,440
one one quick question for you which is

252
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,040
um you talked just about generally that

253
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
this partnership happened but what were

254
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,320
some factors that made this partnership

255
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,399
work so well?

256
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,000
>> So it's a good question because not all

257
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
the partnerships we've had and we we

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,399
have more than 500 partnerships you know

259
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,640
in you know with clinical organizations

260
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,640
and payers providers over the world and

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,320
not all of this successful. I think what

262
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,800
uh made this partnership quite

263
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,880
successful and unique was there was a

264
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
trust in brand you know in terms of like

265
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,200
silver cloud being you know NHS back to

266
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,040
it's used in many chess many NHS

267
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,839
services in the UK and you know that was

268
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,560
a mirror that the the HSSE in Ireland

269
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,120
was looking to and also there was a

270
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,279
continued education campaign and I'm not

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,040
saying an intensive education campaign

272
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm saying a continued education

273
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
campaign of clinician raising awareness

274
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
about how this intervention can help

275
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
patients You know and I think another

276
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,480
important point and this sometimes you

277
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
know is different to what we see in

278
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,560
other partnerships are the incentives.

279
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,880
So what were the incentives for a

280
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,800
clinician to refer to this intervention

281
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,959
and the main incentives would be the

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,040
clinical gain. So the clinicians would

283
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,600
see this as an opportunity for patients

284
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,760
to gain timely access to evidence-based

285
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
mental health support which is sometimes

286
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
you know these incentives are misaligned

287
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
when there are other priorities for

288
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,959
incentives. So I think this is something

289
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,560
that it was quite unique here.

290
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,240
>> All right. Well, thank you. I know we

291
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,079
have we have one more speaker coming up

292
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
and Brian will talk a little bit more

293
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,240
about the research side of our

294
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,800
collaborations. So, uh, thank you very

295
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
much.
