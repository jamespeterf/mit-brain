1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,360
thank you Tim and kg all right so I know

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,040
this is somewhat cliche to say but I'm

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,760
standing between you and standing the

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,760
bathroom and drinking

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,320
food um but I think it's important to to

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,760
do this right in formally I'd like to

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,320
take a moment to extend my sincere

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,720
thanks to our startup companies to our

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,640
MIT faculty and to the team that

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,960
organized this event it made that made

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,360
it possible without their tireless

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,520
efforts we wouldn't have be here today

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,200
so shinomi Quan yui Rebecca Nang jwan

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
Mickey and kg I'd also like to thank the

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,520
kiden run for welcoming us to this

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,719
lovely

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,879
space uh due to the diversity of

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:56,520
Industries represented within our

19
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:59,199
Japanese ILP member base we tend not to

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,800
have themed events but if I must give

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,400
this conference a theme I'd say it was

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,400
centered around addressing Global

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,479
challenges through various discussions

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,920
on advanc materials energy Innovation

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,759
and healthc Care

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,960
Technologies in a world that is

27
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,840
constantly evolving this theme could not

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,080
be

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,280
timely whether you are here to explore

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,520
new trends exchange ideas or collaborate

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,240
with fellow professionals our

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,320
conversations today will shape the world

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,880
in a positive way

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,680
I'd like to highlight a couple of key

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,119
themes

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,880
here so we both the US and Japan are

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,680
living in a time of Rapid change where

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,560
the following are all

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,560

creativity and critical thinking among

46
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,159
our employees and our youth over the

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,280
course of the day we explored some of

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,679
these challenges and

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,160
opportunities aiming to build innovative

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:15,480
