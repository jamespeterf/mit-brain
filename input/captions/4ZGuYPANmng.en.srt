1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,680
And now let's talk about how is adipose

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,000
tissue [music] formed. Adapose tissue

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,400
contains progenitor cells or adipose

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,280
tissue stem cells that can differentiate

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,880
not only into adiposytes but also other

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,960
lineages including cartilage and bone. A

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760
fraction of these cells then enter the

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,560
adypogenic commitment stage where it can

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,439
only become adiposytes and these are

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,439
what we call padiposytes.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,760
Edipost tissue also contain other

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,320
precursor cells that can give rise

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,559
preferentially to beadosytes with

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
thermogenic capacity.

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,920
Finally, under the right conditions,

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,160
both white and beigosittes can convert

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
into each other.

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,800
Much of what we know about adiposite

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,520
differentiation and adipos tissue

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,920
formation comes from in vitro studies.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,879
Here's an overview of these studies

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,680
where we start with a tissue biopsy

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,920
which is then digested to release

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,479
stromal progentor cells which we can

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,720
grow and expand in culture.

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,600
Over the years scientists have

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,720
identified the right conditions

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,880
which we can expose these cells that

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,720
will then lead to the progressive

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,960
differentiation into adiposytes.

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,439
At the mechanistic level, adipoy

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,680
differentiation is defined by key

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,799
transcription factors which will bind

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,400
DNA and drive gene expression programs

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,920
to support lipid storage and metabolism,

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,520
thermogenesis

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,759
and hormone synthesis and release.

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,880
While some of these have been studied in

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,000
great detail including master regulators

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,720
of adipocy differentiation which include

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,600
par gamma CBP alpha. Now modern biology

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,640
and updated pertubation methods suggests

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,000
that there's still much more to discover

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
and the right time to do it is now.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
Now as we come to the conclusion of this

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
first lecture, it's important that we

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,640
discuss how can we harness adipos tissue

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,560
biology to improve metabolic disease

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,360
outcomes.

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,400
And the key overall idea is if we can

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,280
make more and healthier adiposytes, this

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,160
can have an enormously powerful effect

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,360
on metabolic health. So here are some

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,520
ideas of how we can think about uh uh

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
exploring adipos tissue biology to

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,360
improve metabolism. First we can think

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,040
of ways to promote healthy adipos tissue

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,640
expansion where we promote uh newer

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,440
adipocytes or uh hyperlasia versus

60
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,519
hypertrophy or making larger adiposytes

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,599
which as we discussed is linked to

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,560
metabolic diseases. We can also focus on

63
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,800
uh adipos tissue distribution by making

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,440
more subcutaneous adiposytes versus uh

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,440
abdominal or visceral adiposytes which

66
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,319
are also linked to metabolic problems.

67
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,599
We can think about uh ways to promote a

68
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,440
safe lipid storage where lipids are now

69
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,720
mainly uh contained in adipocytes to

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,599
prevent spill over to other tissues. And

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,560
finally, we can leverage thermogenic

72
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,280
properties of beige and brown adipocytes

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,480
to promote a state of positive energy

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,120
balance that will lead to higher uh

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,360
energy expenditure and metabolic

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,760
improvements. And here's how you can

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,959
contribute to this challenge. We'll take

78
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,480
a look at two key questions. What can

79
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,319
machine learn models learn from

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,440
perturbing adipocy transcription

81
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,599
factors? And can we get better at

82
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,159
predicting genetic perturbations that

83
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,640
will shift adiposytes into desired cell

84
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,040
states?

85
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,280
Well, hopefully this first lecture gave

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,387
you a great overview of the biology

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
needed to complete this challenge.

88
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,879
[music]

89
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,959
And next, we'll have Julie walk you

90
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,159
through the technology and the data

91
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,159
provided for this challenge.
