1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,569
The brain is a very intricate

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,471
network of neuronal cells

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,605
and glial cells.

4
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,707
So in order to understand how

5
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:08,575
the brain works,

6
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,843
we need to study

7
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,878
the information across

8
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,080
multiple spatial scales.

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,348
One of the major missions

10
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,282
in our lab,

11
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,417
we’re trying to develop

12
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,652
new tools that allow

13
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:20,820
researchers to do

14
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,621
not just the

15
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,756
molecular sequencing,

16
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,190
but also brain structure

17
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,958
mapping,

18
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,359
as well as, in the long run,

19
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,762
integrating brain activity

20
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,897
observation, connecting all

21
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,565
these modalities into one

22
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,434
measurement so that we can

23
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,835
have a holistic view

24
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,137
of how the brain works.

25
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,173
I was born in China

26
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,275
a small city named Xingtai.

27
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:42,642
From when I was very young,

28
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,877
From when I was very young,

29
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,945
I already got pretty intrigued by

30
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,280
mathematics.

31
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,382
Starting my undergraduate study,

32
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,317
I was a little bit bored,

33
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,886
by all the courses.

34
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,221
However, when I started to work

35
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,791
as an undergraduate in the lab,

36
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,325
it feels totally different.

37
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,594
I feel I can design a new molecule

38
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,830
that doesn't exist before,

39
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,901
and I can study the structure-activity relationships.

40
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,337
It just feels like I was able to create

41
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:15,208
something that no one else knew yet.

42
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,345
I think the Broad Institute provides

43
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,614
a very unique scientific environment

44
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,216
where we can have

45
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,752
a truly interdisciplinary lab,

46
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,455
and not confined in any

47
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,657
traditional academic department setting.

48
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,193
I can just identify the right question

49
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,727
or identify the right mission

50
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,362
and do whatever we can

51
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,731
to work as an interdisciplinary team

52
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,933
to tackle that question.

53
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,202
My central teaching philosophy is

54
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,370
trying to allow the students

55
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,507
to rediscover the scientific knowledge

56
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,043
rather than just asking them to memorize.

57
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,245
You have to give opportunities

58
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,414
to students and trainees

59
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,516
to explore by themselves,

60
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,851
which means they need time

61
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,453
and opportunities to make mistakes.

62
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,988
It feels like I still have 

63
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,690
all my lessons,

64
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,258
and examples.

65
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,793
All the memories are still fresh

66
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,829
so it’s like a direct passing down

67
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,731
of things I try to avoid

68
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,800
or things I recommend.

69
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,468
In a research lab, if you encounter

70
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,036
a failure, it's not a failure.

71
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,571
You can always repeat

72
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,974
and restart over and over again.

73
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,810
So I do think sitting in the lab,

74
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,712
I feel the world,

75
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,914
it’s actually a nicer place to be

76
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,016
because I'm not afraid of

77
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,050
making mistakes

78
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,752
and I just need to keep trying.
