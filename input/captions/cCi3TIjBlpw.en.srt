1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,600
when you apply to the ba master of

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,440
business analytics program you know we

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,120
don't look at anything until the

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,880
deadline so this year the deadline is

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,200
January 3rd um and after the deadline

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,719
all applications are reviewed so we have

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,800
an admissions committee that's combined

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,680
um with faculty members the pro mbn uh

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
program office as well as admission

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,039
staff so there's about 20 people

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,039
involved in reviewing all of the

12
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,000
applications every application is

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,279
reviewed we use those initial reads to

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,160
determine who to invite to interview so

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,480
interviews are a required step in the

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,520
process um but only a subset of

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,239
applicants are invited to interview so

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,399
usually like around 20 to 25% of the

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,920
applicants are invited to interview and

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,600
then of the people who invited to

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,280
interview um we're admitting maybe

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,079
around 30% of those um again this year

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,559
interviews will be held on

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,600
Zoom um you know what are we looking for

25
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,960
at a high level you know we're looking

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,080
to admit people who are smart motivated

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,200
and have been able to demonstrate a

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,280
passion for analytics or data science in

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,479
some combination of things they've been

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,479
a part of so far so that might be from

31
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,640
you know work experiences it might be

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,920
from classes you've taken it might be

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,680
from you know internships or

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
extracurricular activities you've been a

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,880
part of um there's lots of different

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,000
ways for you to demonstrate this kind of

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,920
passion or excitement for analytics um

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,479
we are as I said said before looking for

39
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,479
evidence of a strong academic success um

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,880
so that is you know understanding um the

41
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,880
fundamentals of math so we like to see

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,360
classes like linear algebra

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,479
probabilities statistics multivariable

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,479
calculus um you'll see these are all

45
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,280
kind of highlighted in the application

46
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,479
when you look at um you know uh

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,000
preferred courses that we like to see or

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,399
relevant courses um we're also looking

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,520
for you know some evidence of your

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,079
ability

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:08,800
uh to succeed in computer programming so

52
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:11,680
some familiarity with python R SQL um

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,760
you know some some combination of things

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,200
it doesn't have to be that you've taken

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,920
an actual class for credit it could be

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,840
that you've done an online certificate

57
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,560
it can be that you are self-taught um

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,319
and you've been able to demonstrate this

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,760
through some of the skills and the work

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,239
that you've done um and then typically

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,160
we're seeing people as I said before

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,879
from a stem undergraduate discipline um

63
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,040
but of course there's exceptions to

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,760
everything um and then in terms of

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,239
having kind of a solid industry

66
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,560
knowledge what we mean here is you know

67
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,400
I'll I'll first say we get it most of

68
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,440
you are coming directly from undergrad

69
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,040
or applying with very few years of

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,920
experience full-time so we don't expect

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,920
for you to be an expert in the analytics

72
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,760
or data science Industry but we're

73
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,159
looking for you to show that you have

74
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,000
some you know um relevant exposure to

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,000
the industry and that can come from

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,040
research you've done it can come from a

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,519
hackathon you've been a part of a

78
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,159
conference that you help to plan it can

79
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,200
come from student organizations you've

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,280
been a part of or obviously it could

81
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,120
come from internship or work experiences

82
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,640
that you've been um involved in and then

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,480
um the application is also measuring

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,319
your ability to communicate effectively

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,879
and you know demonstrate that you can be

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,560
a good team player um so we're looking

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,080
for you know obviously um this program

88
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,840
is taught in English it is live and

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,120
inperson we are not a virtual program so

90
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,400
everyone who comes to the business

91
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,920
analytics program is expected to live

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,200
here in Cambridge for the year you

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,920
attend classes in person you know we're

94
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,159
looking for you to have um you know

95
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,560
strong collaboration skills much of the

96
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,400
work that you're going to be doing is in

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,239
a team setting um and we're also looking

98
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,879
for people who are strong enough

99
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,040
academically and have good interpersonal

100
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,840
skills so that they can become an active

101
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,200
member in the community at MIT and at

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,200
Sloan

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,480
so the way we measure all of this is

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,360
through this application process and so

105
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,000
the application itself consists of a

106
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,120
number of different um you know

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,120
components um and I'll kind of list

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,799
through them here um and then give some

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,639
tips along the way so here's a list of

110
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,959
everything in the application we have

111
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,199
you know um academic transcripts that's

112
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,160
all of the academic work you've done

113
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,280
whether it's been degree or non-degree

114
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,199
um seeking so we want to see anything

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,919
that you've done done that's relevant to

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,800
this program so all of your

117
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,160
undergraduate studies if you've studied

118
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,240
abroad if you have graduate degree work

119
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,800
if you've done um you know non-degree

120
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,479
work certificates anything like that all

121
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,800
of it we'd love to see it there's a

122
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,840
space in the application for everything

123
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,320
we ask for a resume I'll go into a bit

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,840
of detail about that in a minute but

125
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,000
it's a one-page resume and we have an

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,120
essay which is you know tell us a little

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,720
bit more about why you're interested in

128
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,759
the business analytics program and what

129
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,400
you're hoping to accomplish I'll kind of

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,199
expand on that as well we have a couple

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,400
videos um so the videos give us a chance

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,039
to understand how well you communicate

133
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,440
kind of on the spot as well as um you

134
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,280
know get a better sense of who you are

135
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,440
uh we asked for three letters of

136
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,960
recommendation and um we are happy to

137
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,759
accept a test if you've taken the GRE or

138
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,520
the GMAT um but it is not a required um

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,199
component of the application so it's

140
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,600
optional however um you know if you have

141
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,039
taken a test uh it's a great way for us

142
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,960
to uh better assess some of those skills

143
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,120
um and then as I mentioned before the

144
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,440
deadline is January 3rd um interviews

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
are also a required step in the process

146
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
and it takes us about a month or so to

147
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,240
read all of the applications and then

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,840
interview invitations go out towards the

149
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,440
end of January um and then interviews

150
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,319
happen throughout the month of February

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,720
and then decisions come out in early

152
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,720
March all right so we'll expand on a few

153
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,000
things here and give some tips so the

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,880
resume I understand if especially if

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you're applying directly from undergrad

156
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,560
you know you might not have had a lot of

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,599
practice with creating a one-page resume

158
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,840
um but we are giving you these

159
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,440
parameters because when you graduate

160
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
from this program and you're looking for

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,280
employment this is how the resume will

162
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,800
be expected to look so a one-page resume

163
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,319
um that you know is listing everything

164
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,720
you've been a part of in Reverse

165
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,240
chronological order it should include

166
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,599
things like your educational experience

167
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,400

168
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,080
internships any kind of research or

169
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,960
other relevant exposure you've had to

170
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,720
analytics um and then you should

171
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,800
highlight any additional Awards

172
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,520
extracurricular um activities you're

173
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,000
involved with leadership roles you've

174
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,599
had or any other additional information

is you know in the application we ask a

bunch of demographic questions as well

183
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,120
and in those demographic questions there

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,199
are small text boxes you can use there

185
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,120
to provide us the job description that

186
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,639
you had an internship or the job

187
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,120
description you had at your full-time

188
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,599
employer and instead you can focus on

189
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,720
the resume and talk about like what are

190
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:29,000
the successes you've had or what is the

191
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,479
impact quantifiable outcomes that you've

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,879
been able to to be a part of um or help

193
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,120
to influence in the work that you've

194
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,599
done um so you have kind of two

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,639
different places you'll be talking about

196
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,919
your work experiences so try not to um

197
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,000
be too redundant in those spots um also

198
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,319
on your resume we want to make sure that

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,159
it's easy for us to read you know

200
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,080
sometimes I see resumés that you know

201
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,840
although they technically follow the

202
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,960
requirements of you know using Times New

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,639
Roman font in a size 10 they're so

204
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,120
densely packed that there's just two to

205
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,319
much information to analyze you know we

206
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,240
are um you're applying to a data

207
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,879
analytics program that is about

208
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,360
visualizing data and making things you

209
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,080
know easy for somebody to digest and

210
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,199
synthesize so we're looking for a resume

other aspects of your application but

we also have a short answer question we

257
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,440
ask everybody to tell us a little bit

258
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,680

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,920
of where they come from you know you can

260
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,760
share lots of different things here but

261
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,480
you know ultimately we're trying to

262
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,279
understand what has been your path so

263
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,320

264
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,279
that has made it um you know unique for

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,920
you and how have you been able to

266

you been able to create a more inclusive

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,560
environment for the people that you've

269
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,440
been a part of or the groups you've been

270
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,639
a part of so we've historically seen

271
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,040
people share stories about their family

272
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,240
their culture their Community all of the

273
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,680
above you know kind of if they've you

274
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,760
know moved from one place to the next or

275
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,200
if they've had to overcome certain um

276
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,320
barriers you know we're trying to better

277
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,440
understand really how the world you've

278
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,240
come from has helped you to become the

279
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,760
person you are

280
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,120
today in terms of recommendation letters

281
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,240
we get lots of questions about letter

282
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,680
um so we are asking for three letters of

283
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,519
recommendation and you know we want at

284
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,040
least one of those letters to speak to

285
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,160
your quantitative abilities ideally this

286
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,279
quantitative focused recommendation

287
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,279
letter would come from a faculty member

288
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,959
you've worked with or you took a class

289
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,880
with um that was you know something

290
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,920
that's relevant to analytics math or

291
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,600
data science um however we understand

292
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,360
that sometimes not everybody has that so

293
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
at least one letter to speak to your

294
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,839
quantitative abilities if you're a

295
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,920
current student you have um you know

we're looking for at least two letters

297
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,680
to come from an academic Source ideally

298
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,680
three so we really would prefer academic

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,120
faculty references um you know that are

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,680
talking about your skills that are

301
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,320
relevant to an analytics

302
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,040
program however you know it is really

303
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,320
your decision um if you choose three

304
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,360
academic letters or two academic letters

305
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,480
in one letter from somebody who is from

306
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,040
a professional source so you know if

307
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,480
you've had a really great internship or

308
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,560
you've had some type of a work

309
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,639
experience during those Summers or

310
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,079
during the course of a semester that you

311
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,120
think would be um important to highlight

312
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,240
we're going to let you decide you should

313
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,560
decide who to choose that third letter

314
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,040
from so know that if you're a current

315
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,240
student we are happy to have three

316
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,600
academic letters however if you feel

317
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,199
that you'd like to also highlight

318
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,480
relevant work experience that you've had

319
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,839
it's okay to have two academic letters

320
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,720
and one from a professional Source now

321
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,760
if you're currently working full-time we

322
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,240
definitely want a professional letter of

323
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,600
recommendation from you um so we would

324
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,079
want a letter from your current or most

325
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,880
recent employer as well as two academic

326
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,199
letters speaking to your you know um

327
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,240
quantitative or relevant cours workk

328
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,360
experiences um so a couple questions we

329
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,839
always get about letters of

330
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,920
recommendation number one the letters of

331
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,240
recommendation are all also due on

332
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,079
January 3rd so entire application is due

333
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,560
January 3rd not just your part um so we

334
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,320
would recommend that you talk to your

335
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,279
recommenders as soon as possible make

336
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,120
them aware of the deadline everything is

337
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,839
submitted online you send um a unique uh

338
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,040
link to your application with the form

339
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,680
to to your recommen recommenders make

340
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,440
sure they know what the deadlines are um

341
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,720
you know and we're asking pretty um you

342
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,399
know specific questions on those letters

343
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,000
of recommendation so you know talk to

344
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,880
your recommenders share with them what

345
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,120
your goals are why you're applying to

346
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,800
MIT Sloan um and you know ask those

347
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,079
recommenders to try to um you know speak

348
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,240
directly to the prompts that we give um

349
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,759
in that

350
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,639
form we have two videos in the

351
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,079
application and I recognize that these

352
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,079
can also create some anxiety for

353
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,759
applicants um however it's a nice tool

354
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,959
for us to get to know you better to

355
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,639
better understand how you communicate

356
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,720
and to learn a little bit more about

357
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,320
what's important to you outside of what

358
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,360
you've shared um in your essay and in

359
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,199
your resume so the first video um is

360
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,199
pretty straightforward you know we ask

361
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,360
you to upload a one minute video that is

362
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:29,279
really uh you introducing yourself to

363
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,079
your hypothetical future class

364
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,279
classmates um so what is it about you

365
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,120
that you want everyone to know you can

366
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,680
kind of think about this as you know if

367
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,839
you were about to walk into a room with

368
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,560
people um who you really wanted to

369
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,040
become friends with how would you

370
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,480
introduce yourself to them you'd likely

371
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,519
share a little bit about your personal

372
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,199
background maybe um what you are doing

373
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,079
right now but you'd probably share

374
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,680
something personal as well you know

375
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,279
something you like to do outside of work

376
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,160
or something that you're really um

377
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,880
passionate about so um so that's

378
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,800
typically what we're seeing you know

379
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,079
this video is not designed to be

380
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,079
something that you have to spend a lot

381
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:12,880
of time editing it's really you know one

382
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,600
take a selfie video very simple um and

383
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,120
you know the tips we have are really

384
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,320
just make sure you're aware of your

385
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,000
surroundings so if it's loud wherever

386
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,680
you're filming you know make sure you

387
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,079
have a microphone or that we can hear

388
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,800
you um and U make sure that we can see

389
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:31,519
you make sure you upload the video um

390
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,040
and that it's success y um uploads so

391
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,079
it's it's pretty simple you record it

392
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,639
and upload it to us the second video um

393
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,399
is a little bit more um is a little

394
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,800
different so the second video we control

395
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,920
and it's really a chance for us to you

396
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,440
know do two things to understand you

397
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,519
know how you um respond to a question in

398
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,920
real time and you know a good authentic

399
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,920
understanding of your communication

400
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,480
skill um so this is is uh a video prompt

401
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,399
so a question will appear on the screen

402
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,240
um and you'll have 10 seconds to read

403
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,000
that question and then the camera will

404
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,000
go on and you have one minute to respond

405
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,880
it's just one take um and these

406
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,800
questions are not questions that would

407
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,920
require any advanced preparation they're

408
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,880
really questions that are simple for you

409
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,040
to answer that should be you know

410
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,040
natural in terms of um you know your

411
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,600
understanding of how to respond to them

412
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,279
you know examples of this would be

413
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,319
question questions like you know tell me

414
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,040
about your favorite course that you've

415
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,240
taken from the past and why or you know

416
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,920
tell me about the best vacation you've

417
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,880
gone on and why they're really you know

418
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,440
very um open-ended really no wrong

419
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,160
answer type of questions but it's a way

420
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,240
for us to understand kind of how you

421
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,920
think on your feet um and really the

422
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,720
biggest tip for this is make sure that

423
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,000
when you are sitting down or standing to

424
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,880
do this um that you're well um aware of

425
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,720
your surroundings and that there isn't

426
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,520
any um extra distractions happening

427
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,760
behind

428
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,439
you uh in terms of academic records um

429
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,679
and relevant coursework I spoke about

430
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,000
this quickly before but we're looking to

431
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,360
really measure your academic aptitude

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,559
and how comfortable you are with really

433
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,039
the Quant quantitative challenging

434
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,160
nature of this program so we are

435
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,079
teaching classes that are you know

436
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,200
essentially at a PhD level they're

437
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,840
focused on um Advanced Techniques and

438
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,679
machine learning

439
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,960
optimization um you know and we're

440
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,120
really trying to understand how you've

441
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,480
been able to learn complex Concepts in

442
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,520
the past and succeed at that so we want

443
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,799
to see evidence of your comfort with

444
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,200
these challenging quantitative um topics

445
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,360
so we will thoroughly review all of your

446
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,200
transcripts that's why we also ask you

447
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,320
to include any other relevant um course

448
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,520
work or non-degree work that you've

449
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,919
completed that's you know important for

450
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,760
us to consider we recognize that over

451
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,799
the past you know five to seven years

452
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,120
the world has changed so much with

453
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,120
regard to generative Ai and computer

454
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,799
science and in order to keep up a lot of

455
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,280
people applying has uh um you know

456
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,200
completed non-degree options or they've

457
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,720
you know been self-taught in a lot of

458
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,440
things and that is great we love that we

459
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,720
we just want to see some evidence of

460
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,120
that in some capacity so if you've taken

461
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,000
a corsera class or if you've pursued you

462
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,960
know additional um professional

463
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,559
development type of work through an

464
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,400
internship or through um you know your

465
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:39,240
full-time work experiences to kind of

466
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,200
round out some of those skills just

467
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,919
include that in some capacity so that we

468
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
know that you've had exposure to these

469
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,760
things um and then a couple other

470
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,200
logistics if your undergraduate degree

471
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,400
um was not taught in English or your

472
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,960
transcripts are not in English we just

473
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,159
ask you to upload a translation in

474
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,360
English so um you know a certified

475
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:04,400
translation Works um you know any kind

476
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,840
of uh notorized translation I know many

477
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,360
um many universities provide a certified

478
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,960
English translation all of that works we

479
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,960
just want to try to make it as easy as

480
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,240
possible for our missions committee to

481
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,799
understand uh the details of um of your

482
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,799
academic

483
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,280
experiences as I said before test scores

484
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:27,039
are optional um however we are happy to

485
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,320
see test scores we accept all of the

486
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,880
above from GRE to G GMAT and GMAT Focus

487
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,559
that's the newer version we're happy to

488
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,679
see um evidence of tests that were

489
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:41,799
taking either in person or online all of

490
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,760
that is acceptable um and you know I'll

491
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,360
say we often get questions about TOEFL

492
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,919
or IELTS we really don't require that

493
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,799
and we don't even really look at it so

494
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,000
um you don't need to worry about that we

495
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,799
have this inperson or uh live I should

496
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,919
say um on Zoom interview with a member

497
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,720
of our admissions committee so we're

498
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,640
very much comfortable in assessing your

499
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,120
English language ability through that

500
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,480
interview process um and you know if you

501
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,080
have taken the test um you know it's

502
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,760
really up to you to include it or not

503
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,080
however it's a great way for us to

504
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,799
understand your ability as I said before

505
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,039
to uh Master something that's a little

506
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,640
bit foreign and challenging and complex

507
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:28,000
um and provide um us evidence that

508
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,360
you've been able to um successfully uh

509
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,960
learn some that's maybe not as familiar

510
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,600
as um you know things that you've been

511
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,400
accustomed to and to succeed at

512
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,640
that all right um a few important dates

513
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,520
to highlight and then we'll get to

514
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,520
questions um in a minute or two uh the

515
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,880

Behavioral type questions as well as

531
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,880
some technical questions um so we may be

532
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,440
asking questions about um computer

533
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,960
programming about you know different um

534
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,520

interested in pursuing this program um

538
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,600
prior to the interview we have two

539
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,760
additional short answer questions we'd

540
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,000

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,440
simulate a real conversation that we

552
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,640
might have with you if we were in the

553
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,880
room with one another um so again it's

554
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,840
30 minutes the best advice I have for

555
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,360
the interview is you know uh be prepared

556
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,000
in terms of feeling confident and how to

557
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,039
talk about your past experiences that

558
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,080
you've highlighted on the application

559
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,080
but also be prepared to to ask some

560
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,320
additional questions of us you know it's

561
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,600
also a chance for us to um you know help

562
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,240
to sell you on why MIT slan is a good

563
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,240
match for you and uh you know we' like

564
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,840
to see that you come prepared with uh

565
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,760
questions for us as

566
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,919
well just generally some additional tips

567
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,720
remember here we are looking for reasons

568
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,400
to admit you so um it is our job to you

569
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,640
know read through all of these

570
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,600
applications find different

571
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,400
characteristics find evidence of you

572
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,919
know the um the skills and the abilities

573
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,080
of students that we like to see

574
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,039
reflected here at MIT Sloan and to help

575
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,320
encourage and support you to get here um

576
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,799
applying early is great so what we mean

577
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,720
by that is try to get your pieces of the

578
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,000
application in as soon as possible um

579
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,799
you know and then making sure your

580
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,919
recommenders have the information they

581
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,720
need um we look at all we're we don't

582
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,919
look at any application data until the

583
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,919
day after the deadline um but we're

584
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,159
really looking to um um you know make

585
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,600
sure we have all the information we need

586
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,799
um to start the the review process on

587
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,480
January 4th obviously follow the

588
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,520
directions be yourself um and again

589
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,880
really just think of us as your advocate

590
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,279
here it is our job to admit you we work

591
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,760
in Admissions and we're really excited

592
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:50,080
to get to know you throughout the

593
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,159
process um and hopefully continue that

594
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
relationship once you become a

595
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,320
student all right so let's get to

596
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,320
questions

597
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,640
thanks Jen for the presentation I'll

598
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,320
kick it off with some of the questions

599
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,559
that we've had we've had a lot in the

600
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,360
chat um so thank you everyone for those

601
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,840
but we've definitely had a few about the

602
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,960
video question too some of them are

603
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,919
wondering if it's a technical question

604
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,480
or what they can expect for the types of

605
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,520
questions they'll see in video question

606
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,440
two yep so video question two is not a

607
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,720
technical question so it does not

608
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,159
require any advanced preparation as I

609
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,679
said before it's very much you know an

610
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,880
open-ended question that does doesn't

611
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,799
typically have any wrong answers it's

612
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,440
more about how you formulate a response

613
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:39,799
kind of in the moment um in your ease of

614
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,240
ability to kind of communicate on your

615
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:44,679
feet um so open-ended questions like you

616
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,720
know what's been your favorite job from

617
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:50,720
the past and why or what's been your

618
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,240
favorite class or can you talk about um

619
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,200
you know a recent accomplishment that

620
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,200
you've had you know very open-ended

621
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,880
questions what

622
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,760
great thank you so much we do seem to

623
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,880
have some folks here that are interested

624
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,760
in both business analytics and mfin so

625
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,840
the first question is is it possible for

626
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,120
students to apply to both programs and

627
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,120
is there any um information that should

628
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,880
or can be repeated between the two

629
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,960
applications yes so um it certainly is

630
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,520
possible to apply to both they both have

631
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,760
you know independent review processes so

632
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,200
the application deadline is the same um

633
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,760
but there's two independent committees

634
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,799
that um review applications so uh you

635
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,679
know my advice would be to tailor your

636
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:42,159
application to the program you're

637
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,080
applying to um that that's um you know

638
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,320
so it's your decision whether or not you

639
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,200
use the same video for instance for both

640
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,080
applications or the same essay we would

641
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,760
suggest that you try to be as specific

642
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,960
as possible in the content that you

643
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,799
share making sure that it relates to the

644
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,640
program you're applying to um but it

645
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,760
it's your call um in terms of the on

646
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,480
demand video you would have to do two

647
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,919
independent OnDemand um video twos um

648
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,520
and then in terms of the recommendation

649
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,520
letters that's your choice as

650
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,760
well that leads me well to some other

651
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,039
questions that we have on the letters of

652
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,039
recommendation um we have some questions

653
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,039
from those attending wondering what kind

654
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,399
of significance might be put on a letter

655
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,600
of recommendation for an Alum if that's

656
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,760
recommended um and then also some

657
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,399
questions if you want to talk a little

658
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,760
bit about the balance between academic

659
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:36,760
and professional recommendations again

660
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,880
okay so um we love to hear from members

661
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:43,200
of our community um about candidates who

662
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,520
are applying however um if I were an

663
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,679
applicant I would make sure that the

664
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,399
people who are writing my letters know

665
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,919
me really well and can speak with

666
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:54,799
specific examples to the prompts or the

667
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,720
questions that recommenders are being

668
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,559
asked so if I happen to know an alum who

669
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,240
does also know me really well then

670
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,039
perfect that's a great person to select

671
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
but if the Alum that you know is

672
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:09,880
somebody who's a couple degrees away

673
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,360
from the work that you were doing or not

674
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,679
somebody who can speak in specifics to

675
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,480
the type of person that you are it might

676
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,720
be better for that Alum just to send us

677
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,159
a quick note or an email and we'll get

678
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,399
it added to your file um I think that

679
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,919
recommendation letters are really much

680
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,679
about um you know giving us as much

681
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,480
tangible information about your recent

682
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,240
experiences so um so as I said before

683
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,679
it's not necessarily who writes the

684
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,320
letter it's what the letter says about

685
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,760
you yeah and then do you want to just

686
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,480
briefly talk about what we're looking

687
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,080
for in terms of the balance between

688
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,000
professional and academic

689
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,440
recommendations yeah so we're really um

690
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,919
this is a a very um academically focused

691
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,200
program and we're looking for evidence

692
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,559
of your quantitative abilities evidence

693
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,799
of your abilities to succeed s in a

694
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,720
successful way in um a challenging

695
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,679
academic environment and the faculty who

696
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,360
teach in the program really want to see

697
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,240
evidence of that from from your

698
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,360
recommenders which is why we have a

699
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,600
strong preference for faculty

700
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,519
recommendation letters you know so

701
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,000
people who you've taken um a course with

702
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,519
that's relevant to analytics or data

703
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,159
science or engineering um people who um

704
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:29,200
can speak to your ability to um succeed

705
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:32,960
you know in a in a a challenging

706
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,000
environment um so for for current

707
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,360
students you know we would like to see

708
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,440
uh three letters from an academic Source

709
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,360
but like I said before there's some

710
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,679
degree of flexibility there if you have

711
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,799
a really great internship or relevant

712
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,519
research experience or relevant

713
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,720
experience working in something um you

714
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,480
know that is not um going to give us

715
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,360
somebody who's a faculty reference so if

716
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,360
you've worked for a PhD student or if

717
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,600
you've worked for uh you know a

718
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,559
volunteer organization that you know is

719
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,200
really important to you you know there

720
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,159
you want to make sure that we hear from

721
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,440
the people who know you best so you have

722
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,000
some flexibility there um if you're a

723
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,320
working professional so if you've

724
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
already graduated school and you're

725
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,279
working full-time we definitely want one

726
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,880
letter from work um but we still would

727
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,399
like to see two letters from your

728
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,399
academic

729
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,960
past great that's super helpful we do

730
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,279
have student wondering about the

731
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,240
interview portion and the technical

732
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:36,519
aspects of that if you can explain a

733
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,039
little bit about what what things our

734
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,799
candidates should keep in mind with the

735
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,080
technical portion of the interview yeah

736
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,440
so um in the interview I I typically ask

737
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,960
you know two or three technical

738
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,480
questions and the questions um might be

739
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,440
you know something related to

740
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,039
multivariable calculus or linear algebra

741
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,960
statistics or probability I might also

742
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:01,279
ask a question related to um how you

743
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,039
might visualize an outcome of some type

744
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,840
of an analysis that you've done um so

745
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:11,200
different tools or techniques you might

746
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,519
prefer to use um you know to um to uh

747
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,880
clean Data before putting it into like a

748
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,880
machine learning model or how you've

749
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,440
been able to optimize a large data set

750
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,840
even if it's something that you've done

751
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,720
in somewhat less sophisticated tools

752
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,480
like Excel or something like that so um

753
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,399
there's a variety of questions that we

754
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,159
might ask and they're going to vary

755
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:33,799
dependent on um you know what you share

756
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,320
with us in your application we're really

757
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,559
trying to ask questions that help us to

758
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,840
balance out understanding all of the

759
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,600
different type of skills and abilities

760
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,360
that we're looking to see so if you talk

761
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,000
a lot about machine learning and

762
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,120
optimization techniques that you've had

763
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,720
in your application we're not likely to

764
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,399
ask a lot of questions about that again

765
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,240
in the interview but instead we might

766
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,080
ask questions about you know data

767
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,760
visualization or um probability or

768
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,600
statistics or something like that so if

769
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,440
if I do ask a question or two um that

770
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,639
that um requires you to calculate

771
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,320
something you can certainly use a piece

772
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:10,760
of paper and a pencil and we'll give you

773
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,000
the time that you need to kind of come

774
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,840
up with that calculation but you know

775
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,440
typically if it is a question that's

776
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,440
like a true mathematics problem I'm not

777
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,240
necessarily looking for a I'm looking to

778
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,200
understand how you would you know um put

779
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,480
together the steps to solve the problem

780
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,679
but you don't necessarily have to

781
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,960
compute the full problem or and come to

782
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:33,600
one um one value in the end um you know

783
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,399
you've all if you make it to the

784
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,960
interview stage this will be you know no

785
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,440
problem you'll all be great at the

786
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,440
technical

787
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,720
questions right thanks John yeah um we

788
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,679
have some other questions thinking about

789
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,080
applicants backgrounds um one of them an

790
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,679
applicant is wondering if we require any

791
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,360
Computing or programming knowledge to

792
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,919
apply to the program it's not required

793
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,760
but it is is preferred so um what I when

794
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,440
I say that um you know we do ask in the

795
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,240
application have you taken any computer

796
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,240
programming classes or are you familiar

797
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,880
with any programming languages um if if

798
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,760
you're not um it doesn't necessarily

799
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,360
mean that we wouldn't admit you but we

800
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,240
might require you to take a class or do

801
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,399
some type of prep work over the summer

802
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,440
prior to joining us so that your

803
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:28,399
learning curve Isn't So steep when you

804
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,120
start um our preferred um uh language

805
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,440
that we'd like to see some evidence of

806
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,440
is

807
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,639
python what

808
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,919
else I'm wondering if you can specify a

809
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,360
little bit for any International

810
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,679
students who are joining us today about

811
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,480
how they should submit their grades um

812
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,200
and and how we handle that based on

813
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,279
different International grading systems

814
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,480
yeah we are experts on analyzing

815
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,760
transcripts from different um different

816
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,720
countries from undergraduate degrees

817
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,039
I've been working in admissions here at

818
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,720
MIT for over 20 years we have a number

819
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,760
of colleagues um who have studied in

820
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,440
different countries and we have faculty

821
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,080
who are helping us and they've they've

822
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,519
come from lots of different culture

823
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,559
cultures and countries as well so um

824
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,080
we're really looking to you know make

825
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:22,360
sure we just have an English translation

826
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,159
of your transcript if it's not in

827
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,039
English already um and then we look very

828
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:30,480
closely at all of the relevant courses

829
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,799
that you've taken at the um the grade

830
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,960
point average that you show based on

831
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,039
whatever the grading system is if it's a

832
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,559
10-point scale a 20o scale you know if

833
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,760
it's um you know if the if a lower score

834
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,639
is that is more preferred so if you're

835
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,159
from Germany and you know a 1.0 is

836
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:51,320
better than a 3.0 we understand all of

837
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,639
the nuances of this so we're really

838
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,399
looking to you know dive deep into your

839
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,240
transcripts you do not need to modify

840
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,480
anything for us we just need to make

841
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,480
sure that it's um you know available in

842
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,559
English thinking a little further past

843
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,399
the application process if someone were

844
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,639
to be admitted to the program can you

845
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,520
talk a little bit about what the

846
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,159
fellowship process looks like yep so

847
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,280
everybody admitted to the program is

848
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,560
automatically considered for merit-based

849
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,399
Fellowship so that's fellowships that

850
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,879
are given based on um the strength of

851
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,320
your candidacy as well as you know the

852
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,560
diversity that you might represent In

853
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,480
terms of the academic exposure the

854
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,240
countries you're coming from um you know

855
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,560
the the path that you've been on so far

856
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,639
um so we look at um factors in terms of

857
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,919
Merit and diversity to award Fellowship

858
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:49,280
everyone is automatically considered um

859
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:52,079
there are also a couple of um you know

860
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,760
MIT graduate student wide fellowships

861
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,240
that mband students have historically

862
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,520
applied for that process would happen

863
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,400
after or you're admitted to the program

864
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,320
um but on the day you're admitted uh

865
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,079
which is uh I think going to be March

866
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,560
3rd this year um you would also find out

867
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,880
at that time if you've been awarded a

868
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,480
fellowship now let me just say that no

869
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,160
one is receiving a full tuition

870
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,599
Fellowship to come to this program the

871
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,560
fellowship funding we have um is

872
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,000
designed to give as many people a small

873
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,000
award as possible so typically those

874
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
awards are around

875
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,119
$20,000 um but there is a lot of value

876
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,200
to this program because in addition to

877
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,200
fellowships um you are also able to

878
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,359
receive a tuition offset for the

879
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,880
Capstone project that you participate in

880
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,480
in the final summer term and so you're

881
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:44,520
receiving a

882
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:48,400
$24,000 um uh offset of tuition um to

883
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,800
cover uh that that Capstone project so

884
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,000
$24,000 is automatically deducted from

885
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,640
your tuition um and then in addition you

886
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,680
get up to about a $5,000 stien for the

887
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,800
summer to cover your living expenses

888
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,560
also um over a third of students are

889
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,440
holding research assistant positions and

890
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,640
those research assistant positions are

891
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,839
paid in a combination of tuition and

892
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,800
stipended but in total they would be

893
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,839
around

894
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,920
$112,000 per semester so if you work as

895
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,960
a as a research assistant for the fall

896
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,359
and the spring semester and you have um

897
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,000
the Capstone project that's taking

898
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,720
$48,000 off the cost of attendance so um

899
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,480
there's a lot of value here there's a

900
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,920
lot of opportunities for you to offset

901
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,680
that tuition with the work that you do

902
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,560
um so you know typically students are

903
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,240
able to figure this out um and you know

904
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,760
we're happy to work with you to to

905
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,200
figure out any additional loan options

906
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,960
or any additional resources that we can

907
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,000
try to help identify for

908
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,640
you that's great thank you you're

909
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,040
answering so many of these questions I

910
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,280
have seen a few questions come in

911
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,119
between um students that are wondering

912
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,040
about the difference between the MBA

913
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,440
program and the business analytics

914
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,400
program if you wouldn't mind just

915
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,880
covering some main highlights of both

916
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,400
yeah so the business analytics program

917
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,560
is really designed for people who are a

918
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,720
little earlier in their career so who

919
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,119
have maybe between zero and five years

920
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,520
of experience with the majority of

921
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,440
students in mban coming directly from

922
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,599
undergrad I think this year it's over

923
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,680
70% of the students came directly from

924
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,359
undergrad but 30% of students had some

925
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,200
combination of full-time work experience

926
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,200
um and mban is really for students who

927
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,119
are looking to really focus and stay in

928
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,520
their Lane in terms of you know they

929
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,319
know what they want they're coming to

930
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,680
build quantitative skills in the field

931
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:43,400
of analytics and data science and that

932
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,119
is what their goal is after graduating

933
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,839
um where the MBA is a lot more flexible

934
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,240
you have two full years we're looking

935
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,599
for people who join that program to have

936
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,079
on average five years of experience

937
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,880
already um and there's an internship

938
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,440
component so it gives you a chance to

939
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,079
use the the academic experience to make

940
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,920
a change and to gain real world exposure

941
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,200
in things that you don't otherwise have

942
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,720
experience doing um so there is a path

943
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,319
or kind of the equivalent of like a

944
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,480
major um in the the MBA that focuses on

945
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:16,760
business analytics we call them

946
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,599
certificates um but you know you would

947
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,119
really want to make sure that you um

948
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,640
consider uh what the demographics look

949
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,560
like and what the class profile looks

950
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,040
like for the MBA verse the mband so if

951
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,440
you're an individual with five or more

952
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,079
years of experience we're happy to talk

953
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,520
to you but we we would um definitely

954
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,599
want to make sure we understand what

955
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,160
your goals are after um and that you

956
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,640
understand what the demographics look

957
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,200
like of either of the programs and the

958
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,200
type of students you'd be partnering

959
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,200
with that's great thank you so much Jen

960
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:53,680
and and I think we're getting through uh

961
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,200
these questions and we're right to time

962
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,000
and you've you've explained this but we

963
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,200
may have caused a little confusion but

964
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,720
for working professionals that are in

965
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,119
that 0 to five range can you clarify

966
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,839
once more about the letter of letters of

967
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,640
recommendation and who they should be

968
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,720
coming from yeah so if you're a working

969
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,920
professional you should have two

970
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,480
academic letters in one professional

971
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,560
letter so two letters still from

972
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,200
academics and one from your current or

973
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,920
most recent employer and any combination

974
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,079
of the three at least one of those

975
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,560
letters should speak to your technical

976
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,560
quantitative abilities
