00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,799
the MIT energy initiative presents

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,400
investors awake to the risks of climate

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,719
change written by Calvin

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,519
hanik poppy Allenby a senior Financial

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:17,279
executive and the former managing

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,960
director of Black Rock has been

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,320
analyzing the link between climate

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,800
change and investing for more than two

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,880
decades for a lot of that it was quite

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,880
lonely Alan B said during her December 1

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,720
address at the MIT energy initiative

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,079
fall colloquium

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,480
there weren't that many other people

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,760
looking at this field and over the last

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,719
3 or 4 years that's completely changed

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,520
increasingly Alan B said investors are

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,039
opening their eyes to the long-term

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,000
risks of climate change risks that

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,800
threaten not only the planet but also

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,360
their

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,480
portfolios and as more institutional

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,800
investors come to see climate change as

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
a threat to their beneficiaries they are

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,480
taking action to fight it still she

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,760
cautioned that much more work remains to

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,879
be done

27
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,680
various investors are at very different

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,439
stages in considering climate change

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,920
Alan be said once they realize this is

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,799
something they need to think about they

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,119
need to do a risk assessment then

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
develop a strategy when you look at

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,000
different institutions she said some are

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,720
just the very beginning of this

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,119
journey a changing

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,240
landscape although there is a compelling

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
moral case to be made for taking steps

38
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,920
to mitigate climate change alanb noted

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,200
that institutional investors such as

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,560
Pension funds are bound by a fiduciary

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,000
duty to their

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,079
beneficiaries that is to say they are

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,600
obligated to put their client or member

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,960
interests ahead of their own I talk

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,640
about fiduciary duty because one of the

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,159
things that has really changed in the

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,159
investment space is that more and more

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,759
investors are beginning to see climate

49
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,439
change and climate risk as impacting

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,119
their fiduciary duty said Alan B that

51
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,439
has been a shift in my mind it makes

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,360
total sense if you're a long-term

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,320
investor

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,799
and you're thinking about beneficiaries

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,159
that need assets over the next 10 or 20

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,959
years and thinking about risks that

57
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,000
might materialize and climate change in

58
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,760
particular then that makes a lot of

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,959
sense but that is not where we were 5 or

60
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,120
10 years ago Alan be spent more than 20

61
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,280
years at the multinational Investment

62
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,560
Management Corporation Black Rock for 17

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
of those years she was a senior

64
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,239
portfolio manager responsible for

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,680
managing multi-billion dollar funds

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,560
investing globally in companies across

67
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,640
the traditional energy sector and also

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,640
those involved in sustainable energy and

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,879
mitigating climate change most recently

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,200
she was head of the corporation's Global

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,000
product group on several continents

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,480
where she provided oversight for nearly

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,440
$1 trillion worth of assets and played a

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,000
critical role in developing black Rob's

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,760
sustainable product strategy where I

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,480
like to think the finance industry is

77
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,640
heading is integration she said this

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,440
means thinking holistically about pretty

79
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,879
much every decision you make as an

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,840
investor and thinking about how climate

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,879
risk is going to impact that investment

82
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,760
that is a sea change the mentality

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,760
around how people

84
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,560
invest divestment versus

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,640
engagement for many years activists have

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,239
pushed for institutions including MIT to

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,840
divest from fossil fuel companies by

88
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,439
keeping fossil fuel companies out of

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,720
their portfolios these activists argue

90
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,840
institutions and individual can exert

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,120
social political and economic pressure

92
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,840
on these corporations and help to

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,640
accelerate the shift to renewable energy

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,840
however alanb argued instead for ongoing

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,680
engagement with fossil fuel companies

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,799
reasoning that this better positions

97
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,760
investors to push for change my personal

98
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,799
view with divesting from oil and gas

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
companies is that's not very effective

100
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,720
Alan be said I think there might be

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
examples where you have very specific

102
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,319
companies which you don't think will be

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,280
involved in the transition to Net Zero

104
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:04,000
and investment might make sense or if

105
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,439
you've got an Institutional Investor

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
where it is imperative that their

107
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,799
investment is entirely aligned with

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,319
their values so certain Charities it

109
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,400
might make sense but if you really care

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,959
about change I think you need to keep a

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,880
seat at the table in a way Alan be said

112
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,079
divesting from fossil fuel companies

113
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,320
lets leaders at those organizations off

114
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,320
the hook reducing the pressure on them

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,840
to make meaningful changes to their

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,440
operations imagine a company that is

117
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,199
incredibly polluting and not sustainable

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,759
and they have shareholders that are not

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,000
happy but they don't do anything and

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
those shareholders decide to divest she

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,880
said what happens as a result of that

122
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,639
potentially is the company goes oh that

123
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,160
was easy I didn't have to do anything

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
and the activists have gone away and

125
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,120
potentially those assets end up being

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,840
owned by people who care less so that is

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,720
a risk when you think about

128
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,120
divestment challenges and opportunities

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,800
alanb outlined several challenges with

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,919
climate focused investing but also noted

131
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,919
a number of opportunities both for

132
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,520
investors looking to make money and

133
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,759
those looking to make a change among the

134
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,560
challenges for one some investors simply

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,039
still need to be convinced that climate

136
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,440
change is a problem they should be

137
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,759
working to solve also Alan be said

138
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,800
there's a lack both of a formalized

139
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,720
methodology and of specialized

140
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,440
investment products for climate focused

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,639
investing although she noted that both

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,479
of these areas are improving finally she

143
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,800
said it remains a challenge to encourage

144
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,039
investors to direct capital toward clean

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,400
energy projects in developing

146
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,360
countries investors can both set

147
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,560
themselves up for financial success and

148
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,360
mitigate climate change Alan be said

149
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,400
through Savvy investments in either

150
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,560
distressed or underpriced assets if you

151
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,199
can buy assets that are discounted or

152
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,759
cheaper because people have real

153
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,840
concerns about their environmental

154
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,800
footprint then you can work with those

155
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,440
companies to improve it and therefore

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,759
reduce the risk and improve the

157
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,960
valuation she said Alan be pointing to

158
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
the high cost of waterfront property in

159
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,319
areas that are vulnerable to rising sea

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,199
levels also suggested that the long-term

161
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,400
risks of climate change have not been

162
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,400
fully priced into many assets my view is

163
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,880
that we've really gotten our arms around

164
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,759
that she said from a purely investment

165
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,039
perspective that's also an opportunity

166
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,880
additionally Alan be noted the recent

167
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,960
rise of ESG funds which invest with

168
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,639
environmental social and corporate

169
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,720
governance guidelines in mind some of

170
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,160
these funds she noted have outperformed

171
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,880
the larger market over the past several

172
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,240
years when we talk about climate change

173
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,599
one has a range of emotions alen be said

174
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,000
sometimes it can feel like we're not

175
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,319
making enough progress and one of the

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,400
nice things about being here at MIT is

177
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,800
that whenever I'm here I always feel

178
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,879
hopeful about the future and quite

179
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,240
hopeful about all of the technology IES

180
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,599
and work that you are doing to

181
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,120
transition Energy Systems and move

182
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
things forward when you look at what's

183
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,520
happening in the financial services

184
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,039
sector there's still a huge amount to do

185
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,039
but it's also quite a hopeful story
