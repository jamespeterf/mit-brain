00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,490

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,440
Welcome to the
featured presentation

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,370
portion of today's program.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,190
Each talk will be 15 minutes
with an additional five minutes

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,560
for Q&A. So each
talk will actually

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,130
be about 10 to 15 minutes.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,850
We told the students
15 minutes max.

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,520
[LAUGHS] All right.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,710
Our first speaker
is Lansing Horan,

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,140
a graduate student in
Professor Jack Harris' group.

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,650
Lansing's research is in
fusion plasma physics,

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,509
and he will be presenting today
on "Shadowgraphy Measurements

13
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:38,090
of Radiatively Cooled
Magnetic Reconnection Layer."

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,095
All right, Lansing, do
you want to take it away?

15
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:56,960

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,740
All right.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,130
Good afternoon, everybody.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,850
Thank you for the
introduction, Anza.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,519
My name is Lansing, and I'm
a third-year NSE student.

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,790
Today, I'll talk about
"Shadowgraphy Measurements

21
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,560
of a Radiatively Cooled
Magnetic Reconnection Layer."

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,710
This presentation
will aim to break down

23
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,670
this title into the key terms.

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,360
So we'll start with
magnetic reconnection.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,850
So to orient you into what
magnetic reconnection is,

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,810
it is a fundamental process
that occurs everywhere

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,280
in the universe, where
there is magnetized plasma,

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,170
which is most of the universe.

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,770
So to start out, we have a
simple two-dimensional cartoon.

30
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,490
Imagine we have two blobs of
plasma on a collision course,

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,450
and that these blobs of
plasma happen to have

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,910
anti-parallel magnetic fields.

33
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,440
If we assume that
the plasma is ideal,

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,900
this means that
the magnetic field

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,880
lines will move with the plasma
flows, like that shown here.

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,330
Now, due to an
electrodynamic effect,

37
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,200
whenever we have oppositely
oriented magnetic field

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,340
lines close to each
other, we generate

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,220
a large electric current, such
as that shown here in green,

40
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,860
pointing out of the board.

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,870
The benefit of this
current, or one implication,

42
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,100
is that it allows the magnetic
field lines to further diffuse

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,400
into each other, eventually
overlapping at the center

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,780
and achieving
magnetic reconnection.

45
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,160
This is where the magnetic field
lines overlap and annihilate

46
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,170
themselves at the center.

47
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,500
The object in our system that
we'll focus on for this talk

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,040
is at the center in yellow.

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,840
This is the reconnection layer.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,290
This is simply the region where
magnetic reconnection occurs.

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,560
It is a small location of the
overall plasma environment.

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
So with that background,
why should we

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,320
care about magnetic
reconnection?

54
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,800
What ramifications does it have?

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,190
So first, as we can see with
this animation of a solar flare,

56
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,710
which happens pretty
frequently with our sun,

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,820
magnetic reconnection is
often an explosive process.

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,750
In breaking the
magnetic field lines,

59
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,380
it allows for violent
plasma eruptions.

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,550
And then secondly, reconnection
is a heating mechanism.

61
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,180
The plasma is energized
where the magnetic field

62
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,390
lines annihilate.

63
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,230
Energy is transferred from
the magnetic field lines

64
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,350
to the plasma.

65
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,500
This leads to additional
interesting effects

66
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,530
that we'll talk about
in the coming slides.

67
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,910
So with this background
for magnetic reconnection,

68
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,240
let's talk about the
specific type of reconnection

69
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,170
that we're interested in--
radiatively cooled reconnection.

70
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,230
So the question naturally is,
How does radiative cooling

71
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,490
affect the reconnection layer?

72
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,360
Again, I have a simple
two-dimensional diagram here

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,420
on the slides.

74
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,300
And we just learned
that reconnection

75
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,630
is a heating process.

76
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,420
So the plasma in
the layer is hot.

77
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,350
In order to cool itself off,
it's going to release energy.

78
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,360
It's going to emit x-rays.

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,550
This has the effect
of, of course,

80
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,550
decreasing the
temperature of the plasma

81
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,560
in the layer and
also, of course,

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,880
lowering the thermal pressure.

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,220
But we still have
the constant streams,

84
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,610
the flowing streams from the
left and the right of the layer.

85
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,730
And so if the thermal pressure
of the layer is decreased,

86
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,940
it allows those
inflowing plasma streams

87
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,210
to further compress the layer,
thereby increasing the density,

88
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,190
m.

89
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,780
The last bit of
information that we

90
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,890
need to complete an
interesting circuit,

91
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,190
an interesting
positive feedback loop,

92
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,060
is knowing that the X-ray power
scales with the density squared.

93
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,730
So if we're
increasing the density

94
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,260
by compressing the
layer due to radiation,

95
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,070
we're actually ending up
with more X-ray emission

96
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,190
than what we started with.

97
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,407
So this is a positive
feedback loop.

98
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,740
So the answer to the question
at the title of this slide

99
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,520
is radiative cooling drives
the layer of plasma colder

100
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,600
and denser as time progresses.

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
So there's an
interesting interplay

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,450
between reconnection as a
heating process and radiation

103
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,460
as a cooling process.

104
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,930
So why should we care about this
specific type of reconnection?

105
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,080
The first and foremost reason
is this type of reconnection

106
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,860
with radiation is pervasive
across a huge range

107
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,670
of astrophysical conditions.

108
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,710
It occurs everywhere
in the universe,

109
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,160
both in local environments
like the solar chromosphere,

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,400
as well as environments galaxies
away, such as the M87 black hole

111
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,840
accretion disk.

112
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,310
Secondly, theorists believe
that the radiative spectra

113
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,070
that we receive from
space plasma environments

114
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,950
that we record in
telescopes is the result

115
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,650
of magnetic reconnection as
the driving heating process,

116
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,360
inducing that radiation.

117
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,190
So this is our key, if not
only, observational signature

118
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,030
for astrophysical environments.

119
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,020
So if we want to better
understand the radiative spectra

120
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,970
that our telescopes
capture, we need

121
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,490
to understand the
fundamental process that

122
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,110
generates that radiation,
which is magnetic reconnection.

123
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,910
OK.

124
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,630
So with this
background, we can have

125
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,000
an open question in this
specific very niche research

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,610
field.

127
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,540
And that question is, How
does the layer structure

128
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,610
evolve in time during
radiative collapse?

129
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,220
But before we can immediately
answer this question,

130
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,040
we need to figure out, How
do we even address this?

131
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,510
How can we actually gain
any understanding here?

132
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,120
So by my count, there
are four different ways

133
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,070
that we can evaluate
magnetic reconnection theory.

134
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,590
First is computer simulations.

135
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,430
These are great.

136
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,390
These are powerful.

137
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,200
But like a lot of
simulation work,

138
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,090
there's always the question
of initial conditions.

139
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,750
It's not always clear,
which initial conditions we

140
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,160
should assume in our
numerical modeling.

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,720
And these could have a great
impact on the end result

142
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,178
that we receive.

143
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:34,720
Also, there's always
the question of,

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,208
How much can we really
trust the numerical outputs

145
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,000
that we're getting?

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,510
Because we're not sure
if we're accurately

147
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,970
modeling all of the
richness of physics

148
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,340
involved in this process.

149
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,550
The second way to evaluate the
theory is in situ measurements.

150
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,820
This is just saying,
What if we take a probe

151
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,180
and send it to the location
where magnetic reconnection is

152
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,030
occurring?

153
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,810
But for our case
of trying to learn

154
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,700
about astrophysical plasmas,
this is a non-starter.

155
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,560
These environments
are too extreme

156
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,610
or simply way too far for
us to ever send a probe

157
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,080
and actually measure
reconnection at its location.

158
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,940
A third technique is
remote observations.

159
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,590
So this is what I
mentioned before,

160
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,680
where we have
telescopes which capture

161
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,230
radiative spectra from all
throughout the universe.

162
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,850
But we can't infer everything
we need from radiation alone.

163
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,810
It would be better if we could
have other plasma parameters,

164
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,330
like the velocity, the density,
the temperature, in order

165
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,610
to more fundamentally
understand where

166
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,390
this radiation is coming from.

167
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,820
So that leaves us with our
fourth and final option,

168
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,900
lab experiments.

169
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,260
And that's what we'll focus
on for this talk here.

170
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,210
The benefit of
lab experiments is

171
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,150
we have a controlled
environment to measure in detail

172
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,510
and up close the specific
plasma physics at play.

173
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,740
So bringing it back
to the open question,

174
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,130
we're going to answer this
with a laboratory astrophysics

175
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,280
experiments.

176
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,340
This brings us to the
secret hidden part

177
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,890
of this title, Sandia's
Z machine, which

178
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,230
is the location,
the facility where

179
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,480
we conduct our experiments.

180
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,450
For those of you who don't know,
the Z machine at Sandia National

181
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,230
Labs in Albuquerque, New
Mexico is the world's largest

182
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,180
pulsed-power device.

183
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,330
This is a cut, a slice
through the center

184
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,900
of the overall machine.

185
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,520
It is absolutely massive.

186
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,100
It is 33 meters in diameter.

187
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,520
And just for reference,
in red, that's

188
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,380
about the size, the height
of a typical person.

189
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,787
This whole machine is
in a giant warehouse

190
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:32,120
out in the middle of the desert.

191
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,960
And working our way from the
very outer diameter, and then

192
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,110
inwards, starting out with
the capacitor banks in green,

193
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,370
this is where electricity
is charged up prior

194
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,810
to an experiment
on the Z machine.

195
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,570
And then this machine is
so complicated and large

196
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,960
and designed in order to deliver
a huge amount of electricity

197
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,700
to a very small area in
the center of the machine,

198
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,220
in the vacuum chamber.

199
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,520
In the bottom right, this is an
actual photograph of two Sandia

200
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,590
technicians working
and preparing

201
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,930
for an experiment prior to
a shot on the Z machine,

202
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,810
again, to give you
a sense of scale.

203
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,310
And one of the last
things I'll show

204
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,070
is at the very tip of
those orange arrows

205
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,650
in that little tiny
circular region, that's

206
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,280
the size of our experiments.

207
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,760
This is where all of our plasma
physics are actually occurring.

208
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,150
So we need this
absolutely massive machine

209
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,030
to deliver 20 million
amps of electricity

210
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,080
to a volume that's maybe
100 cubic centimeters.

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,230
We need the Z machine in order
to reach high-energy density

212
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,530
physics regimes.

213
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,680
Again, to give you
a sense of scale,

214
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,790
at the outer diameter
of the machine,

215
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,550
the power per volume density is
about 200 watts per cubic meter,

216
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,810
just as an order of magnitude.

217
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,360
For reference, a light bulb,
60-watt light bulb is about

218
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,230
300,000 watts per cubic meter.

219
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,175
So 200 is pretty benign.

220
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,310
Like, not much interesting
is happening there.

221
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,270
But interestingly, at our
target at the experiment,

222
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,310
we achieve about 200,000
trillion watts per cubic meter

223
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,940
in terms of energy density.

224
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,380
This is why we
need the Z machine.

225
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,380
This is the only machine
where we could actually

226
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,200
reach this insane level
of energy density.

227
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,990
For reference, a
nuclear fission reactor

228
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,770
is about 10 billion
watts per cubic meter.

229
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,800
So this brings us to Magnetic
Reconnection on Z, MARZ.

230
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,890
That is the name of our
collaboration with Sandia.

231
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,650
This is a picture
that we started out

232
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,800
with on the title slide.

233
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,230
This is a picture of
the load hardware.

234
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,440
So this is our
experiment basically

235
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,980
at that really small volume at
the center of the Z machine.

236
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,820
On the next slide, I'll explain
why we feel that these, what we

237
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,090
call wire arrays--

238
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,920
but for now to give
you a sense of scale,

239
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,520
each wire array
is 40 millimeters

240
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,240
in size, which for reference
is the diameter of a ping pong

241
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,710
ball.

242
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,870
The space between
each wire array

243
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,270
is about 20 millimeters,
so half a ping pong ball.

244
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,980
And on each array, it
might be a bit hard to see,

245
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,530
but arranged in a
cylindrical cage,

246
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,820
there are 150 aluminum wires
on each of the wire arrays,

247
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,340
so 300 total.

248
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,640
And each of these metal wires
is only 75 microns thick.

249
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,500
So that's the size
of a human hair.

250
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,320
This entire system is
incredibly complex,

251
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,550
takes months of planning.

252
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,390
And I don't know how the Sandia
technicians actually build

253
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,030
these things, but it's amazing.

254
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,700
Shown in purple is the path
of the electrical current

255
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,860
that the Z machine delivers
to our metal targets.

256
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,430
We reach 20 million
amps of electricity

257
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,167
in less than a millionth of
a second on the Z machine,

258
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,750
which, again, is
what we need in order

259
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,070
to generate a lot of radiation
in our plasma environment.

260
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,790
So everything I just showed you
was two exploding wire arrays.

261
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,600
And the reason that
we use these devices

262
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,260
is because they allow us to
generate magnetic reconnection

263
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,280
in that laboratory environment.

264
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,270
So with that current path in
purple on a single wire array,

265
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,040
this has the geometry we need
to generate radially diverging

266
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,650
flows of plasma emanating
from each of those wires.

267
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,300
And so if we place two wire
arrays next to each other,

268
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,810
the most interesting region of
this diagram is in the center.

269
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,140
So we see that we have
flowing streams of plasma

270
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,880
coming from the left and the
right meeting at the midplane.

271
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,960
And they're carrying
anti-parallel magnetic field

272
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,540
lines.

273
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,230
This is consistent with
that cartoon example

274
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,800
of magnetic reconnection.

275
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,790
So this is why we
field what we field.

276
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,480
So bringing it back
to this question.

277
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,758
So now we have the background.

278
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:29,550
We have the theory.

279
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,690
We have the experiment.

280
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,140
But now we need to
choose, How do we actually

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,400
diagnostically measure this?

282
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,990
How do we get any information
about the layer structure?

283
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,880
That brings us to the
first word of the title--

284
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,340
"shadowgraphy."

285
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,090
Before I talk about the specific
application of shadowgraphy

286
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,700
on our experiments, I just
want to give you some intuition

287
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,510
for what shadowgraphy is.

288
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,740
It's a phenomena that we
are all familiar with.

289
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,870
When we've been outside
on a bright, sunny day

290
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,290
next to a pool, we've
seen the rays of light

291
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,980
strike the surface of the water.

292
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,070
And due to the wave
patterns at the top

293
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,530
as well as throughout
the pool, we've

294
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,110
seen that there's interesting
patterns of light and dark

295
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,770
that form at the bottom.

296
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,100
So this is, essentially,
due to the changes

297
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,400
in the index of refraction
bending the rays of light.

298
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,310
So in our case, we're going
to apply shadowgraphy,

299
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,530
where our light
source is not the sun

300
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,660
but instead, it's a
high-intensity laser.

301
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,390
And our medium is not water,
but instead, a plasma fluid.

302
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,180
So that's shown with
this cartoon here.

303
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,740
We are looking at the top-down
on the two wire arrays.

304
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,740
At the center, we have
our reconnection layer.

305
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,500
This plasma only exists for less
than a millionth of a second.

306
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,070
But we carefully
time a laser pulse

307
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,200
to shine through the entirety
of the reconnection layer

308
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,990
during that experiment.

309
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,660
Looking at cross sections
of the laser beam profile,

310
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,550
so looking at the side,
initially, ideally our laser

311
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,940
beam profile is uniform.

312
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,570
It's flat.

313
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,160
It's traveling through vacuum.

314
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,990
But at the bottom right, we see
that the image of that laser

315
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,850
beam profile that we
collect has artifacts,

316
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,880
has the imprinting of
the reconnection layer

317
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,090
itself within it.

318
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,230
We see that the rays of light
have been deflected outwards

319
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,890
away from the region
of highest density.

320
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,480
So this is the last thing
I will show you for today.

321
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,320
These are going to be the
experimental datagrams

322
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,020
from our Mossbauer experiments
from April of last year.

323
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,200
And a shadowgram is just the
name of what we just saw,

324
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,710
the camera snapshot of the
laser beam intensity profile.

325
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,140
And for reference,
at the top, I'm

326
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,430
showing you the side
view of our system,

327
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,030
again reminding you that
we are shining the laser

328
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,540
beam into the board through
the entire reconnection layer.

329
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,280
So from our
experiment last year,

330
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,540
these are the four images
of our laser beam profile

331
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,660
that we collected.

332
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,530
These are the first images
of a radiatively cooled

333
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,600
magnetic reconnection layer,
not a very popular field,

334
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,940
but we were the first.

335
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,730
And moving from left to
right, the amount of time

336
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,660
is only about 40 nanoseconds.

337
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,200
So we can see a huge
amount of variation

338
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,420
in a very short time frame.

339
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,340
And I'll remind you
of our open question--

340
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,620
how does the layer
structure evolve in time

341
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,310
during radiative collapse?

342
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,000
And I'll quickly give you
four qualitative observations

343
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
we can immediately
make from these images.

344
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,010
First, in the center, we
see a dark sensual void.

345
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,370
This is the result of
the reconnection layer

346
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,330
being denser than
its surroundings,

347
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,720
deflecting light outwards.

348
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,740
Second, we see enhanced bands
of intensity of bright features

349
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,700
outside the reconnection layer.

350
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,960
This is the result of shock
waves which form in our system

351
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,370
because our plasma flows
are moving supersonically.

352
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,020
Second, especially
in that third image,

353
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,030
we see small-scale variation
in the Z direction moving

354
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,870
up and down in our images.

355
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,020
The fact that we
see these variations

356
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,600
indicates that we have
instabilities of interest

357
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,840
in our plasma, which we
hope to further quantify.

358
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,730
And then fourth,
especially shown

359
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,820
on that final frame, the
fact that dark, sensual void

360
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,590
in the images
appears to be getting

361
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,740
larger and larger with time
is consistent with the idea

362
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,870
that the density in
the reconnection layer

363
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,260
is increasing as time
passes, the layer compression

364
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,050
due to radiative cooling.

365
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,350
So with this, we've broken down
all the key terms in the title.

366
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,000
And very briefly,
four quick takeaways.

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,240
First, magnetic reconnection
is an energizing process.

368
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,360
It heats the layer of plasma.

369
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,090
Second, radiative
cooling is pervasive

370
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,430
in astrophysical plasmas,
and it drives the layer

371
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,700
to be colder and denser
as time progresses.

372
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,570
Third, the MARZ platform
on Sandia's Z Machine

373
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,300
allows us to study
extreme plasma physics

374
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,590
in an up close and
detailed manner.

375
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,160
And fourth, and finally,
laser shadowgraphy

376
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,280
is the technique that we're
using in order to image

377
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,010
how the layer structure evolves
during the radiative collapse.

378
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,295
Thank you.

379
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:05,095
[APPLAUSE]

380
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:12,460

381
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,961
Any questions?

382
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:20,700

383
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,150
No questions is OK.

384
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm good with that.

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,745
[LAUGHTER]

386
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:30,090

387
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,700
I asked this earlier,
but does this

388
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,910
need, like, two independent
plasmas to hit each other?

389
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,080
Or could you see this in
a tokamak, where, like,

390
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,660
if you have some crazy thing?

391
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,410
Oh sure, yeah.

392
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,790
Oh yeah, sorry.

393
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,210
Yeah, so it could be two
initially separate plasmas

394
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,860
that happen to be on
a collision course

395
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,060
and then impact each other.

396
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,750
It could be that, or
I think more commonly,

397
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,480
like a plasma itself is often
of a very fluid and turbulent

398
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,030
thing.

399
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,970
So naturally, if you have
this big plasma soup,

400
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,040
it has a lot of turbulent
motions within it.

401
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,770
So it's almost like
internal to the plasma.

402
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,830
These magnetic field
lines are moving around

403
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,950
and getting twisted about.

404
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,100
So it's almost inevitable
that eventually there's

405
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,950
going to be a region, if
not multiple regions, where

406
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,490
magnetic reconnection occurs
even within the same blob.

407
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,370
Does that make sense?

408
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:22,870
Yeah.

409
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,900
Would that sort of
turbulence be enough pressure

410
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,610
to get one of these
reconnection events?

411
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,020
Or do you need them to
slam into each other?

412
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,000

413
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I think I believe the
inflow of velocity--

414
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,730
I don't think you need it to
slam into each other per se,

415
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,670
but you do need--

416
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,540
I mentioned at the
very beginning,

417
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,090
we were assuming
that the plasma is

418
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,640
ideal, which means
that the field

419
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,100
lines move as the plasma moves.

420
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,380
So what we do need
is not necessarily

421
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,000
them to slam into
each other, but we

422
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,480
do need a mechanism
for the field lines

423
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,850
to actually move independently
of the plasma flows.

424
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,110
And there are different ways
that you can go with that.

425
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,130
There are different
ways that can happen.

426
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,060
But I don't think that's
requisite of close

427
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,210
slamming into each other.

428
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,440
Cool.

429
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,050
Thank you.

430
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,280

431
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,850
Question.

432
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,980
I can ask you one.

433
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,760
Your images, your shadowgrams,
the very integrated effect

434
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,010
of what has happened
to that laser,

435
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,630
how much effort do
you expect to have

436
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,330
to do in trying to reconstruct
backwards what essentially

437
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:29,830
happened?

438
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,300
Oh, sorry.

439
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,883
How much what?

440
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:34,320
How much work in reconstructing
what is actually happening?

441
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,490
Construction resume?

442
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,090
Yeah.

443
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,560
Yeah.

444
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,885
I might have a slide on this.

445
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:46,830

446
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,800
OK, I don't think I do.

447
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,300
Sorry.

448
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,090
So that's currently what
we're working on right now.

449
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,570
We're trying to-- sorry,
let's go back to the images.

450
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,320
We're trying to
take these images.

451
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,790
And for instance, we want
to quantify the density jump

452
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,380
across this shock front.

453
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,570
So the way that we're
doing that is a combination

454
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,650
of numerical modeling.

455
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,980
We have a Monte Carlo
ray tracing code

456
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,360
that we can use synthetically
to go about this.

457
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,030
But we also have--

458
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,280
we're trying to take an
analytical approach as well,

459
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,450
where we can have a
forward model, if you will,

460
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,550
where we assume a shock
profile and then tune

461
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,650
the parameters
within that function

462
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,290
that best reproduce the
intensity profiles we see.

463
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,040
So that's currently
what we're working on.

464
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
And that's why I didn't
include it in this talk.

465
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,310
But we're working on that.

466
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:38,850

467
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,630
OK.

468
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,560
I have a sort of
general question.

469
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,010
So you're showing
these shadowgrams.

470
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,970
When you guys were setting
up this experiment,

471
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,600
were there any
particular challenges?

472
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,350
Like, did it work right
away, or was there

473
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,990
a lot of troubleshooting
you had to do?

474
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,513
Just when we do experiments,
right, things really

475
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:55,180
work right away.

476
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,150
So I'm just curious
how that went.

477
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,090
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,070
So in the lead-up to this
experiment, which, again,

479
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,650
was one year ago in April,
we spent at least six months

480
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,360
preparing for fielding this
diagnostic for the first time.

481
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,490
Our experiment here,
this was, I think,

482
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,700
maybe the second or third
experiment that Sandia actually

483
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,750
used laser shadowngraphy on.

484
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,050
So it's a very new technique
for their facility.

485
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,920
And we did a lot of, like I
mentioned, the ray trace code

486
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,710
that we have.

487
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,260
So we have 3D and HD modeling
of our plasma system,

488
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,950
like the entire system and the
evolution of the reconnection

489
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,590
layer.

490
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,750
So we took that 3D electron
density mesh and then fed it

491
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,470
through the ray trace code.

492
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,810
And then we used that sort
of simulation type modeling

493
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,070
in order to design the actual
fielding of this diagnostic

494
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,950
in the experiment.

495
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,610
So we got to choose where
to position the lens, what

496
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,820
the focal length should be.

497
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,320
How do we--

498
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,490
It doesn't really
work the first time.

499
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,340
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,490
So it did work for the
first time, which was--

501
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,450
Congratulations.

502
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,670
It was kind of very fortunate.

503
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,180
Very high stakes because we
only get one or two shots on Z

504
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,680
a year.

505
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,040
So if it didn't work, then--

506
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,540
Yeah.

507
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,990
So it actually does--

508
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,908
that shows how hard the
team worked on that.

509
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:12,950
That's really impressive.

510
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,090
Yeah.

511
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,590
But there was a lot
of preparatory work

512
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,580
to maximize our chance of work.

513
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,247
Yeah, of course.

514
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,240
So yeah.

515
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,010
Thank you.

516
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,670
Yeah.

517
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,720
We need to move on.

518
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,370
[APPLAUSE]

519
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,000
