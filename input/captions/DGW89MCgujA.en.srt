00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,800
hello everyone welcome to the

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,519
2024 dressle house

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,280
lecture it is an H

4
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,440
on behalf of MIT Nano for me to have a

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
chance to stand in front of you and on

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,840
behalf of MIT I welcome today's dress

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,079
house lecturer who I'll introduce in

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,719
just a moment my name is Vladimir

9
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,559
bulovic I'm the director of MIT Nano and

10
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,120
I have had the privilege of knowing

11
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,280
Millie dressle housee for many years uh

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,960
and had the privilege of being inspired

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,519
by her example many more years that

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
followed from the moment I met her I'm

15
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,320
absolutely

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,080
in all that I have a chance now to

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,000
introduce her namesake lecture in order

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,280
to carry the mission and the vision of

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,560
what Millie has indeed given to many of

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,080
us commitment to both fantastic science

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,200
and commitment to humans around us

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,439
building upon the opportunity of

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,720
building that science and human

24
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,159
community that will Define tomorrow

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,560
thank you for being here and allow me to

26
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:37,200
introduce the dressle house lecturer in

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,439
this 2024 edition of the lecture um we

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,079
are very lucky to be hosting today

29
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,439
Professor Claire gray or as I was told

30
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,840
by a colleague the appropriate title

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,960
would be Dame Professor Claire gray

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,840
ordinary Dame commander of the Civil

in many

38
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:11,080
reasons but most importantly we are

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,360
looking for inspiration that indeed we

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,680
know you

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,160

interests include the use of solid state

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,400
NMR and defraction bit methods to

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,480
determine structure function

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,120

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,900
you to take the stage and tell us about

73
00:03:45,799 --> 00:04:00,300
your own work please

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:04:00,300
[Applause]

75
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,640
so it's truly wonderful to be here to

76
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,280
celebrate the the life and the science

77
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:17,479
of Millie dressle house and

78
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,040
um I I knew Millie not very well but I

79
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,799
worked with her particularly

80
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
particularly through a workshop in

81
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,240
Russell Heimer for a number of years and

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,080
this is Millie with a very diverse group

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
of um scientists two women Millie and

84
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,199
red and me

85
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,440
this was Millie when she we were doing

86
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,280
Outreach activities to some of the

87
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,639
scientists who'd come from various Arab

88
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,400
Emirates countries and this is Millie

89
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,400
when we went up to the top of the

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,960
mountains to watch the sunset with Shake

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,560
sa and she's there very much engaged in

92
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,160
a conversation with him he then responds

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,840
equally vividly so she was a wonderful

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,440
person uh in terms of interactions and

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm people in this audience obviously

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,280
know this more than me but there were

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,880
perhaps PhD students who haven't had so

98
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,800
much of an opportunity to interact with

99
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,600
her and of course it wasn't just about

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,919
that it was the wonderful Legacy of

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
Science and what I've tried to do today

102
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,720
is I'm going to talk about some

103
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,240
different things I don't always talk

104
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,000
about particularly inspired by some of

105
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,000
the work of Millies and just to sort of

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,840
look at the papers that have been

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,039
instrumental to some of the thinking of

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,479
what we've been doing recently it's this

109
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,280
wonderful review in 1980s where she

110
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,199
pulled together a whole mass of

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,800
different

112
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,240
structural electronic properties of

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,639
graphites starting with some of her own

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,720
work in the 196 1965 and this was one of

115
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,720
the second papers in 66 on spin orbit

116
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,000
interactions a very classic work on

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,680
intercalation compounds and of course

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,520
was a very she was a very strong

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,600
advocate for women in science and this

120
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,840
is an article she wrote you know as

121
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,319
early as

122
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,680
1975 and if you spent a bit of time

123
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,440
reading it um

124
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,280
she's there stressing this is in the

125
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,000
conclusions that diversity is important

126
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,440
because it brings um all of the larger

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,440
Community into doing science so so I'm

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:19,240
honored to be here to give a lecture on

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,080
her behalf or in honor of her rather so

130
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,720
um with that as a link I just wanted to

131
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,520
start by saying I'm going to talk about

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,800
batteries and of course the battery uh

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,479
this the lithium ion rechargeable

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,919
battery was put together in sonyy in

135
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,400
1990 was to power their camcorder so I'm

136
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,840
sure that many of the PhD students in

137
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
the audience have probably no idea what

138
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,479
this thing even is but it was you know

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,560
it was the com that was Sony that wanted

140
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,080
it not for their they weren't a battery

141
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,759
company they were desperate to have more

142
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,199
energy density and of course it was the

143
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,639
combination of people like John good

144
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,960
enough and others with the lithium

145
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,440
Cobalt oxide chemistry but then on the

146
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,800
carbon side it was um people working in

147
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,599
carbon of which Millie was very much one

148
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,440
of them I like to put this paper up uh

149
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,000
from John goodoff where he this the

150
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,960
first paper on lithium cobal oxide in

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,639
Matt reses bll just to remind also the

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,160
PhD students in the audience that you

153
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,680
can get a Nobel Prize with the Matt res

154
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,280
ball paper it doesn't have to be in

155
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,400
nature and science so reflect on that

156
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,199
when you're so I'm here and I don't

157
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,879
again have to tell this audience that

158
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,160
batteries have really transformed the

159
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,280
way we live you know the ability to be

160
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,479
able to to access information on the Fly

161
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,639
they really have underpinned the

162
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,560
portable Electronics Revolution but why

163
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,080
we're working them on them now is

164
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,759
associated with climate change so these

165
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,199
are pictures of the icebergs in Iceland

166
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,960
that are melting faster this is in

167
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,039
Cambridge and when I say Cambridge in

168
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,280
this conversation I mean the

169
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:58,039
Cambridge and this is flooding uh in

170
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,879
grest outside Cambridge from excess rain

171
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:04,800
the other day and so it's the sort of

172
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,680
possibility of using um batteries to try

173
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,919
and reduce carbon emissions and also

174
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,960
pollutions so if you just think about

175
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,159
Transportation uh batteries are good

176
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,720
enough we have cars that are around and

177
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,440
they're cars made by people I don't want

178
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,000
to be political here but who have become

179
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,680
very important in the last few months um

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,520
but they're still too expensive and I

181
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,639
think uh yes and I were talking about

182
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,599
some of these things earlier on and

183
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,919
we'll continue a conversation afterwards

184
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,320
about some of these things but the

185
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,279
question we have is how do we produce

186
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,919
batteries at the cost that are suitable

187
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,320
for Mass adoption globally so it's not

188
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,240
just if you live in Cambridge UK or

189
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,519
Cambridge us and you can afford to buy

190
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,560
your Tesla it's how do you do this to

191
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,600
Electrify the planet and the biggest

192
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,480
challenge is really how do you make

193
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,680
batteries to allow more Renewables on

194
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,920
the grid so you need batteries for

195
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,560
dealing with short-term fluctuations but

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,480
you also need the ones that are much

197
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,200
more a bigger challenge for the long

198
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,560
periods of time so at the moment the sun

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,399
is shining so you're okay in the UK

200
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,760
sorry in the US in the UK this time of

201
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,560
year we have no wind and we also have no

202
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
sun and that's one of the biggest

203
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,600
challenges and I think just to get the

204
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,000
context of scale the UK has two pumped

205
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,560
storage locations and one of them is a

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,519
mountain inside Wales where the whole of

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,600
the Mountain's been dug out and you pump

208
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,800
the water up and down and that has a

209
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,320
storage capacity of 9.1 gwatt hours this

210
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,959
is the Tesla Mega Battery now there are

211
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,920
bigger ones than that than that but you

212
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,320
can see that this the challenges of

213
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,519
scale and so how do we do this in a

214
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,480
sustainable way and then we think about

215
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,560
the chemistry that's um out there since

216
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,120
the 19 um the lithium cobal oxide

217
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,640
battery graphite battery I was been

218
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,480
telling you about the energy density has

219
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,920
gone up by about a factor of three or

220
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,000
four the price has gone down by more

221
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,480
than a factor of 10

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,680
um but if we're going to really make

223
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,720
step changes we need to come up new

224
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,000
chemistries and come up with new

225
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,160
materials that are both more sustainable

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,680
and more safe and think about other

227
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,360
issues like secondhand use which then

228
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,839
mean that we have to make batteries that

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,560
last longer and then we have to do them

230
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,600
in a safe way so this is a little

231
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,839
picture of a Samsung Galaxy Notebook

232
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,120
those of you who fly May recognize the

233
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,440
the back end of an airplane seat this

234
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,279
was one that caught fire on a plane and

235
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,760
this was an incident because Samsung

236
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:36,600
tried to put the same amount of battery

237
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,160
in just uh 10 5% less space and so as

238
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,760
the battery expanded and contracted

239
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,920
Parts moved and it ended up short

240
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,279
circuiting so to think about

241
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,920
sustainability if we just imagine and

242
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,120
look up the numbers for all of the

243
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:55,279
gigafactories that are being built uh in

244
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,959
globally they need more tons of cobalt

245
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,920
than are actually being mined from the

246
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,959
DRC in Congo with all of its

247
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,760
mining issues even lithium mining has

248
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,959
sustainability issues these are the

249
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,160
salar in this particular one is in Chile

250
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,880
and you can see the flamingos feeding on

251
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,000
the algae there but as the companies are

252
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,680
coming in they're pumping out the the

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,120
brins they're left to evaporate so the

254
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,600
water's draining there there's

255
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,920
evaporation issues elsewhere and it's

256
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,839
affecting the whole ecosystem so this is

257
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,959
a global challenge that we have to think

258
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
about to try and increase the the

259
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,839
diversity of different minerals that

260
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,519
we're

261
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,959
using so in order to improve batteries

262
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,120
and this is I'm just preaching to the

263
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,240
converted here we need to understand how

264
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,959
they work we need to understand how they

265
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,120
operate and we need to understand how

266
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:48,560
they degrade and the the challenge is

267
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,440
that some of these processes happen in

268
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,760
Picos seconds to milliseconds but yet

269
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,760
they're going to manifest themselves in

270
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,600
the days to hours to years that you

271
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,160
might use your battery for and so how do

272
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,560
you think about and how do you tease

273
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,519
apart the relevant processes and it's

274
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
not only the time scale issue it's also

275
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,639
the size scale issues you have to worry

276
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,839
about particles uh small and what the

277
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,240
atoms and electrons get up to but you

278
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,519
also need to worry about what the

279
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,079
particles do and what the the pack scale

280
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,240
do but we're here in a university and so

281
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,079
it's our challenge to really understand

282
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,040
some of the fundamental questions that

283
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:27,279
have

284
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,399
impacts now but also in the next 10 to

285
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,399
20 years as we try and address the 2050

286
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,519
uh Global challenges to reduce CO2 so um

287
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,959
for for my sins I lead the battery

288
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,519
degradation project in the UK where

289
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,600
we're interested in what's known as a

290
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,440
full cell so full cell all it means is

291
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,440
that you have a cathode and you have an

292
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,720
anode and they not just lithium metal

293
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,839
and you work out how the the various

294
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,680
components interact with each other and

295
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,079
so for example if you charge your

296
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,959
cathode material up to two high voltages

297
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:00,760
oxygen can come off that oxygen can go

298
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,079
on the other side and it can react with

299
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,120
the the graphite and cause additional

300
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,519
mechanisms so I'll tell you a little bit

301
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,519
about U some of that but I want to start

302
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,839
by telling you about in insitum

303
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,320
metrologies because this is what I've

304
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,279
been developing over the last rather

305
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,839
large amount of time but then after that

306
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,720
I want to tell you a story about

307
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,199
connecting local structure and Dynamics

308
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,360
through to mechanisms and if I have time

309
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,720
I'll talk about fast charging and where

310
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,959
we're going

311
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,000
next so I don't think I need to um

312
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,240
belabor the point but it's much easier

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,160
to study an operating device in situ or

314
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,959
operando so operando means you're

315
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,800
actually cycling in situ just means you

316
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,040
don't pull it apart and it's useful

317
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,440
because you don't have to make lots of

318
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,040
different batteries and you can just

319
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,040
study one thing at different states of

320
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,759
charge but the more interesting thing is

321
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,320
that if you take the batteries apart

322
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,480
sometimes there are processes that don't

323
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,560
survive

324
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,600
disassembling and it's not so easy when

325
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,600
you do anmr spectroscopy just to take a

326
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,839
battery

327
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,680
and put it inside a spectrometer because

328
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,040
batteries have metal cans and so you've

329
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,199
got to get the RF through that you need

330
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,360
to excite the NMR so youve got to

331
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:13,519
redesign your systems and pretty much

332
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,120
any operando measurement has some you'd

333
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,320
have to have go some sort of thought

334
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,480
process as to how you design the setup

335
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,440
for the particular technique and each

336
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,160
will come with advantages and

337
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,639
disadvantages and there are other

338
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,600
challenges first of all sometimes the

339
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,639
batteries Catch Fire which is a little

340
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,480
bit of an issue there are big things

341
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,000
like you have leads coming up these

342
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,920
leads pick up um RF so in this room for

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,800
example um the radio frequency I I don't

344
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,800
know what frequency of NPR is I think

345
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,959
it's about 91 Point something that's the

346
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,680
same frequency as carbon that's sort of

347
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,920
what causes this noise so you've got to

348
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,320
do all the RF um filters to stop this

349
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,639
and then you've got the more interesting

350
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
challenges associated with the diversity

351
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,040
of different materials that have very

352
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,040
large shift ranges and also as you're

353
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,079
cycling the susceptibility change

354
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,560
changes so over the years we've

355
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,199
developed um new cells to look at it

356
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,320
this is a so-called plastic bag battery

357
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:11,040
where you um use the same technology

358
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,560
that you would to seal coffee or to seal

359
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,560
smoked salmon you use a food laminator

360
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,480
and you put your battery inside and you

361
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,839
can do NMR of this or we upgraded it to

362
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,800
plastic cells that are much easier to to

363
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,120
to to put together and then we um design

364
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,279
setups where we have p Electric Motors

365
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,360
inside our NMR cells so that we can tune

366
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:34,639
the components on the fly as the

367
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,160
materials are cycling so I just want to

368
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,319
give you a little flavor of the sort of

369
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,399
things we've learned over the years the

370
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:44,560
first study that we did was on Silicon

371
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,680
so graphite has a capacity of about 370

372
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,279
milliers per gram if you use silicon you

373
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,160
can react 10 times more lithium with it

374
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,560
and so it's been touted for many years

375
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,040
as the sort of Ideal replacement for

376
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,959
graphite but what we showed in this very

377
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,560
simple study was that if you took the

378
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,120
fully lithiated silicon and you just let

379
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,880
the system rest you could watch the open

380
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,920
circuit voltage go up which means

381
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,680
there's a reaction happening and by

382
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,120
looking at the NMR in situ you could see

383
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,160
the peak disappearing as this material

384
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,040
was being oxidized by the electrolyte

385
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,199
and so the the electrolyt is being

386
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,600
reduced itself it's being oxidized and

387
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,639
so this was the first study to show that

388
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,360
the problem with silicon was not per se

389
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,199
the large volume expansion of silicon as

390
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,720
it reacts with lithium but that it

391
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,720
didn't form a nice passivating layer on

392
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,920
the top of it and that's what forms in

393
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,680
graphite and it's called the SEI and

394
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,040
that's why all graphite materials

395
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
actually work so just to give you

396
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,519
another example I wanted to sort of put

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,040
carbon in as the the the the theme and

398
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,240
lot of what I'm talking about um in in

399
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,920
sodium ion batteries you can't

400
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,160
intercalate sodium into graphite you can

401
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,120
intercalate Lithium you can interpolate

402
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,319
potassium but sodium is the wrong size

403
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,519
and so if you want to go for a more

404
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,079
sustainable technology you've got to

405
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,000
form a new find a new anode replacement

406
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,799
and the thing that people use for um the

407
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,959
replacement is a material called hard

408
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,039
carbon which is just essentially a

409
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,880
carbon that's heated up that doesn't

410
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:17,319
graphitize it has enough um defects in

411
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,959
the structure that it doesn't form

412
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:22,880
beautiful uh layers and so what we did

413
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,400
was to use sodium andmr to understand

414
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,480
the mechanism of how you interpolate or

415
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,080
insert into these graphite hard carbon

416
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,320
graffi type structures and so the model

417
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,880
of a hard carbon is the so-called House

418
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,080
of Cards and what we showed was that you

419
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,120
had first of all insertion into

420
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,679
diamagnetic regions and then you filled

421
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,360
in these so-called sodium pools with

422
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:49,039
pores inside uh the hard carbon

423
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,320
structures so then just to um move

424
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,360
forward we' now we used our instit

425
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,799
Metrology to look at a whole variety of

426
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,559
different materials and so if we think

427
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,360
about what are the Next Generation

428
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,360
higher energy density mat materials that

429
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,720
are more sustainable we could look at

430
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,600
lithium sulfur we could look at lithium

431
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,120
air batteries so lithium air is a

432
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,799
reaction of lithium to an oxygen to form

433
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,280
peroxide the problem with um a reaction

434
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,559
like this it goes via superoxides

435
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:21,039
superoxides are basically the radicals

436
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:23,080
that inside eat up um cause cancer and

437
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,480
and will react with everything they do

438
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,559
the same thing in a battery they will

439
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,919
eat up the electrolyte and cause

440
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,880
degradation and so we've developed over

441
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,880
years auction methods to track what's

442
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,960
going on and similarly we use sulfur

443
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,600
andmr to track what goes on in Sulfur

444
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,400
batteries so just to sort of um give you

445
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,400
one more example again with carbon so

446
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,679
the other if you want to do a high rate

447
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,159
um electrochemical cell you might use a

448
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,520
super capacitor so super capacitors

449
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,640
Bridge dialectric capacitors of

450
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,159
batteries in that they have higher

451
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,600
energy density not as high as batteries

452
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,159
but they also can charge in principle

453
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,000
faster than than Battery Systems they're

454
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,240
used in the um they're in your mobile

455
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,320
phones as flashes they're also in the

456
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,240
emergency exits of the Airbus systems

457
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,000
and they work because they have these

458
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,640
beautiful hierarchical structures and so

459
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,440
you take a coconut you activate it

460
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,679
essentially the same coconut systems

461
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,240
that you'd have in an activated carbon

462
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,000
uh that you would use for water

463
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,720
filtration and you form these

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,720
hierarchical structures these strands

465
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,799
here are the PTFE strands to hold the

466
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,600
thing together and then you can store

467
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,480
charge by simply inserting ions and at

468
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,360
the Double layers um of these carbons

469
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,960
and what we did with our instit NMR this

470
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,679
is now a while ago was to look and ask

471
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,880
the question how do ions insert inside

472
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,120
carbons and so what you're watching in

473
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,840
real time is the Florine NMR of the

474
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,960
annion in this salt tetraethyl BF4 minus

475
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,559
in a in a aceta nitrol so this is the

476
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,360
signal as you're charging up and down of

477
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,400
the ions going in and out of the pores

478
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,320
and the signal is going is Shifting

479
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,440
backwards and forwards as you're

480
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,400
inserting in this case we're going

481
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,799
positively so we're inserting holes into

482
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,559
the system we're charging up the the

483
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,840
Carbon sheets and we're reducing the

484
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,159
aromaticity of the carbon and what is

485
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,440
happening there is you're getting um a

486
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,679
reduction of the the aromaticity you

487
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,919
have reduction of the local field on top

488
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,120
of it the uction of the So-Cal nuclear

489
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,080
independent chemical shift that you're

490
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,960
seeing there so you're actually able to

491
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,559
track the extent of whole doping in

492
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,760
these carbons and say something about

493
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,799
the mechanisms of

494
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,559
interpolation but that was that was nice

495
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,320
from a sort of theoretical perspective

496
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,760
but this method actually allowed us to

497
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,480
ask a very simple question that hadn't

498
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,080
been shown experimentally before so if

499
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,679
we imagine an activated carbon so again

500
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,600
these are the activated carbons that you

501
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,360
would have in a water filtration system

502
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,440
we all know that the ions will go in so

503
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,799
at zero volts we've got equal numbers of

504
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,880
negative ions and positive ions and

505
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,960
surprisingly it wasn't known before

506
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,600
whether you would store charge so let's

507
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,640
imagine we do an experiment we charge

508
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,120
something positively you could either

509
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,279
kick out the positive charge for charge

510
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,720
compensation or you could bring in the

511
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,679
negative ones or you could swap them so

512
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,640
you could do an iron expulsion ion

513
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,840
exchange or so on and so what we did was

514
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,440
to look at this and quantify the ions

515
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,720
charging to positive versus to negative

516
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,000
and we showed that if you charge

517
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,080
negatively you actually sorbed cats

518
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,279
whereas if you charged positively you

519
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,200
had an iron exchange mechanism and then

520
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,200
by doing Pulse Field gradient

521
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,400
spectroscopy we able to show that if you

522
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,760
stuff lots of catons in your material

523
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,120
not surprisingly the diffusivity of the

524
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,840
the ions inside these pores went down

525
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,000
and so the sort of moral of the story

526
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,840
was if you want to get high rate you

527
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,799
want to avoid these types of carbon

528
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,919
absorption prot you want to have an ion

529
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,000
exchange process so that you can still

530
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,400
move the

531
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,400
ions and so more recently we've looked

532
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,400
at how um how to optimize these carbons

533
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,880
for these processes there was a very

534
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,799
nice work of paty Simon a few years ago

535
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,720
that said you wanted pores about the

536
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,880
same size of the the ions the solvated

537
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,159
ions and that this was a descript of

538
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,159
capacitance our more recent work with um

539
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,120
my collaborator Alex Force showed that

540
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,360
actually you could have carbon with very

541
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,760
similar pores and you have very

542
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,880
different capacitances and actually the

543
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,080
better descriptor that we picked out

544
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,960
from these NMR signals was the degree of

545
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,520
coherence of the Carbon sheets and as

546
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,480
the system got more disordered non

547
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,880
intuitively the capacitance went up and

548
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,200
that's because if you have lots of

549
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,440
defects in the Carbon sheets you start

550
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,159
pinning charge near these defects and

551
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,679
then you can p pin the ions nearby this

552
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,919
was a paper just published very recently

553
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,559
and then Cara Fong who is a poster in my

554
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,240
lab with Angelos mades has been doing

555
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:11,840
some very beautiful um MD simulations

556
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,840
using machine learned um force fields to

557
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,640
really understand the nature of iron

558
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,120
pairing in these types and related

559
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,880
systems okay so that's my introduction

560
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,039
on inet dematology I want to now lead

561
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,320
you through a story where we're going to

562
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,880
connect local structure all the way

563
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,480
through to mechanisms for how materials

564
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,520
inter

565
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,559
and so the story starts with this

566
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,520
material nmc811 so this is the uh

567
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:40,159
cathode material that's in most of

568
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,480
today's electric vehicles it's a layered

569
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,760
compound like lithium cobal oxide but

570
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,760
you've replaced 80% of the Cobalt by

571
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,640
nickel and 10% by manganes so that's the

572
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,640
811 and we do NMR of this material and

573
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,240
I've studied these materials or me

574
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,240
collectively and my group have studied

575
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,120
them for many years so we know how to

576
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,480
interpret these quite complicated

577
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,760
Spectrum so we're going to do exit NMR

578
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,000
we're going to take different batteries

579
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,720
at different states of charge and try

580
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,720
and unpick what these sort of broad

581
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,559
blobs mean and the sort of main thing is

582
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,559
that when you take this material it's a

583
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,559
mix nickel 2 to Nickel 3 uh oxide that

584
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,799
gets oxidized to Nickel 4 plus so for

585
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,320
those of you who've forgotten your

586
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,240
inorganic chemistry nickel 4 plus is low

587
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,679
spin D6 it's diamagnetic and the only

588
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,960
paramagnetic ions that are in the system

589
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,039
a manganese 4 plus and when you pull

590
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,480
most of the lithium out the lithium

591
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,840
remains near these paramagnetic

592
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,760
manganese 4 plus ions and that's why you

593
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,320
get these Spectra and so the sort of

594
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,320
take- Home messages we can actually

595
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,399
interpret these Spectra the thing that

596
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,360
we can't interpret is in the Middle

597
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:50,919
where things get quite

598
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:53,240
sharp and when NMR signals so this is

599
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,919
lithium NMR so I'm looking at the local

600
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,120
environment around the lithium and when

601
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,679
I pull out 10% of the structure I see

602
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,279
this very broad feature I heat it up and

603
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,559
not much happens but if I pull out 25%

604
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,679
of the lithiums I now have vacancies in

605
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,480
the lithium layers and the ions can

606
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,679
start to move and this what the

607
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,799
signature of motion is quite clear from

608
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,760
when you heat this material up because

609
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,679
the ions are moving they're changing

610
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,799
their local environment and so you get

611
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,440
what's known as motional averaging so

612
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:25,440
the NMR only sees the average

613
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,600
environment of the ions moving in these

614
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,399
layers and you can see by the time you

615
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,760
got rid of 50 50% you've got very high

616
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:35,120
lithium mobility and this to a material

617
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,080
science audience is not that surprising

618
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,880
you have vacancies and so you have room

619
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,279
for the irons to move and you actually

620
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,919
need die vacancies for it really to go

621
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,520
fast and so what Katarina my posto did

622
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,480
was to um simulate these Spectra and

623
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,880
extract the hopping rates for transport

624
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,760
and so if you um go from about 20%

625
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,919
removal to about 70% removal you have

626
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,279
hopping rates of about 80 to 100 khz so

627
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,159
these ions are moving very fast in these

628
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,440
structures and we can get an activation

629
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,799
barrier for that transport by just

630
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,440
varying the

631
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,440
temperature so there's a there's two

632
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,720
points you why do you U why do you get

633
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,159
increased Mobility one is that the uh

634
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,640
layers increase and then at the end they

635
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,880
collapse and so that collapse is why you

636
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,360
actually stop moving the lithiums at the

637
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,960
end of charge there's another phenomena

638
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,640
which I worked on with a a former

639
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,240
collaborator who may be familiar to some

640
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,960
of you in the audio

641
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,840
um and that's associated with as G Seda

642
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,039
that's associated with the charge of the

643
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,480
ions on the layers and above and if you

644
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,159
oxidize your nickel from 2 plus to 4

645
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
plus you have um if I'm a lithium ion

646
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,679
I'm hopping from octahedral site to

647
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,039
tetrahedral site to octahedral site

648
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:48,880
there's a very short contact there and

649
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,039
that short contact gives you the

650
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,559
activation barrier and the higher the

651
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,520
oxidation the bigger the cumic repulsion

652
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,640
so this all makes sense so I'm going to

653
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,480
move now the spirit of Millie from the

654
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,559
anode to the from the cathode to the

655
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,559
anode I'm going to think about graphite

656
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:08,360
so again we all know graphite we take

657
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:12,640
graphite we have these various stages so

658
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:16,399
stage four for example this l means U

659
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,360
less dense it's or light or low um it

660
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:23,039
means and the stage four means it's

661
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:25,159
every four lithium is filled and you go

662
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,600
through stage four to three to two and

663
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,919
then you form the dense stages two and

664
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,000
one and thing about the the dilute

665
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,640
versus the denser stages and this was

666
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,480
something that Millie worked on is you

667
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,399
have very different uh different

668
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,320
conductivity and so you go from the

669
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,519
dilute stages that have very low

670
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,679
conductivity to the dense ones that are

671
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,799
very conducting and you can see that by

672
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,559
NMR so this is the uh the the dilute

673
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,919
stages which have a very small shift uh

674
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,080
once you form the dense ones you have

675
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,760
this large night shift which is a

676
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,960
measure of the density of states of the

677
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,919
firmy level as um measured by the lith

678
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,600
and then the other thing that's

679
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,240
interesting about it that again comes

680
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,640
out from the NMR is you can via

681
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,240
technique called a T1 row measurement is

682
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,360
you can quantify the diffusion the

683
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,279
diffusivity and it's very um easy to get

684
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,840
the diffusion coefficient at the

685
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:21,240
so-called T1 minimum and so the minimum

686
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,840
uh is is where the transport is the same

687
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,840
frequency as the Lal frequency and so as

688
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,360
you go from a dilute stage to stage one

689
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,799
you can see that the diff the

690
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,440
diffusivity here is the same but the

691
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,880
temperature at which you achieve that

692
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,960
diffusion coefficient varies and so the

693
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,159
diffusion coefficients in the dilute

694
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,840
stages are much faster than in the dense

695
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:47,320
stages but they're of the order of uh 10

696
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,080
to the minus 11 Cent squar per second so

697
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,640
the question I wanted to then ask was

698
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,080
how does this Mobility affect the

699
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,760
intercalation mechanism and to look at

700
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,679
this I've been working with my colleague

701
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,880
AE RA in the Cavendish and so if you

702
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,799
want to understand how particles are

703
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,600
inserted you typically go and find your

704
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,640
local synchrotron you set up very clever

705
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,679
mytic experiments where you focus the

706
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,919
synchron beam at your particle and you

707
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,799
watch what's going on and it's it's

708
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,559
great you can get beautiful information

709
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,399
beautiful uh spatial and temporal

710
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,679
resolution but you get the reality is

711
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:24,240
you often get beam damage and it's not

712
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,159
easy to get a lot of beam time so what

713
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,880
we did was to do something much more

714
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,760
simple we were inspired by the work of

715
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,000
Phil kakuru at um Oxford who developed a

716
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
lot of very good microscopy techniques

717
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,440
called ice scats it's a rather horrible

718
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,480
name um to look at fluorescent uh

719
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,399
fluorescent biological systems so

720
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,960
biologists look at they tag things and

721
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:47,480
things move around and they can watch

722
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,200
things very rapidly here we're just

723
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,120
going to use this method to look at

724
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,360
scattering of a particle now scattering

725
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,399
is proportional to polarizability and

726
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,120
the degree of scattering will be

727
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,559
dictated by the differences in the

728
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,120
polarizability of the two medium so if

729
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,559
you've got a particle it'll be the

730
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,000
difference between this particle and the

731
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,760
medium around it it it'll be lower

732
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,519
resolution we've got resolution of the

733
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,240
order of 300 nanometers it's a little

734
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,799
bit better now but we don't have any

735
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,640
direct chemical specificity so actually

736
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:21,039
and I hypothesize that we should maybe

737
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,840
be able to use this to follow how ions

738
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,480
went into material so that's the way we

739
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:29,440
went into it this was a story of 2020 or

740
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,880
end end of 2019 and I said let's keep it

741
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,840
really simple let's use a particle

742
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,559
that's big and we know what's happened

743
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,480
so we took our friend lithium cobal

744
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:41,880
oxide um the student Alice Merryweather

745
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,559
made some beautiful um uh experiments

746
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,159
where she diluted the lithium cobal

747
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:49,279
oxide in a carbon Matrix we just took a

748
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,000
Ramen microscope cell and so you can see

749
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,039
the the basil plane the top of the

750
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,919
lithium caral oxide and the

751
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,279
electrochemistry is doing its normal

752
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,480
thing so lithium Cal oxide has a metal

753
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,279
insulator transition which is this peak

754
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,880
here that um is shown in the dqv plot

755
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,200
and this process is an ordering

756
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,440
transition at lithium point5 that I'll

757
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,360
explain in a few seconds so this is the

758
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,600
first um Imaging of icat so what you're

759
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,200
seeing is the sem and these are the

760
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,159
pictures and you're F we're focusing on

761
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,760
the flat parts of these particles but

762
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,360
we're going down about 300 nanometers so

763
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,519
this is not a surface method we are

764
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,880
really looking at bulk phenomena and

765
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,600
then we got this image in March

766
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,679
2020 and we had all of the pandemic to

767
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,200
work out what was going on so this was

768
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,639
the one positive for the pandemic for me

769
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,919
was that we could actually think about

770
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:43,279
it so what you're watching is this is

771
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,519
now lithiation that's the li5 tra phase

772
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,600
transition this is a solid solution and

773
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,120
this is the two-phase reaction you're

774
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,559
going to see a nucleation across there

775
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,120
but now watch it in the other direction

776
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,600
so we're going to start fully lithiated

777
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,480
a particle and you're going to see that

778
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,880
actually things start to emerge from the

779
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,039
edges and you come shrinking in and then

780
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,480
you have a solid

781
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,919
solution and then this thing coming up

782
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,440
here is the ordering transition

783
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,919
li5 ripping through this particle so

784
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,840
what's going on so there's this

785
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,880
beautiful paper by um Martin bazant and

786
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,880
yang sha horn who had uh examined

787
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,679
different mechanisms and thought about

788
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,919
why you would get different types of

789
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,279
intercalation processes and they

790
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,080
separated these two mechanisms So-Cal

791
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,440
shrinking core mechanism and an

792
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,720
intercalation wave mechanism and if you

793
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,120
look at our particles this is exactly

794
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,039
what's Happening Here you've got a nice

795
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,840
shrinking core this is shown sort of in

796
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,159
um snapshots but on the way back you're

797
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,919
lithiating and you're nucleating one

798
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,799
thing and it's moving across so why do

799
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,919
you have two different mechanisms on

800
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,360
charge and discharge so uh what my

801
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,919
former postto Quinton did was to try and

802
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,639
model this with continum modeling and we

803
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,279
just think about why this might happen

804
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:03,559
so we start off again we've got this

805
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,559
lithium Rich phase the lithium is

806
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,559
stuffed the lithium isn't going to go

807
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,679
anywhere the diffusion coefficients are

808
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,600
very very low and then we have a a metal

809
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,320
insulator transition with a imiss

810
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,399
ability Gap to form this lithium por

811
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:21,080
phase that's metallic but it's also got

812
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,639
much higher ionic transport and so if

813
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,559
you think about your particle I'm

814
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,159
hearing my pink phase lithium isn't

815
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,679
moving I pull the lithiums out from the

816
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,279
edges and it's so much easier to keep on

817
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,519
pulling lithium out of the blue phases

818
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:38,320
and so the particle that gradually has

819
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,799
this shrinking core but I now go in the

820
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,480
opposite direction I nucleate somewhere

821
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,960
and now I've formed a pink phase that

822
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,799
lithium isn't going to go through the

823
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,120
pink phase the only way that pink phases

824
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,440
can grow is if it goes into the blue

825
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,200
phase and adds to it and so by a very

826
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,559
definition it's really going to have to

827
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:00,120
grow out in that direction and in sort

828
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,360
of uh in in reality it's the tradeoff or

829
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,600
the rate at which you can pull ions in

830
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,559
and pull them out the J versus the

831
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,800
relative diffusion coefficients of the

832
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,919
two phases that explain this and so just

833
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,919
for completeness this is this ordering

834
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,079
transition I was telling you about this

835
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,960
is a you form a phase li5 where you have

836
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,359
ordered vacancies vacancies lithium

837
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,119
vacancies lithiums so you've lost the

838
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,240
three-phase three-fold symmetry of

839
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,159
lithium caral oxide and you can

840
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,440
sometimes form three domain in a

841
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,320
particle and sometimes it goes with just

842
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,200
a single domain so that's lithium cobal

843
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,720
oxide so I just want to move on from

844
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,159
lithium cob oxide because of course this

845
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,760
is the material of the 1990s just to

846
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,839
talk about um n nmc materials uh and the

847
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,919
question I want to talk about was again

848
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:49,879
uh this um Discovery at least from our

849
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,320
hands that if you started to pull

850
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,919
lithium out of these materials even

851
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,159
though these materials in principle were

852
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,320
a solid solution they also had these

853
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,000
two-phase reactions and we said that

854
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,040
this was associated with a particle

855
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,520
level phenomena meanwhile there's a very

856
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,119
nice paper by um will choose group and

857
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,440
Martin bazant who um commented on the

858
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,560
fact that there was probably a electrod

859
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,440
level process that caused this and so we

860
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,320
wanted to look at this phenoma by our

861
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,040
ice cat method to see if we could at

862
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,480
least look at it at the particle level

863
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,680
and you can see now we've out of the

864
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,240
pandemic we've improved our microscope

865
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,640
we've got rid of some of the the

866
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,359
artifacts and you can see there's a lot

867
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,680
of heterogenity going on and if we just

868
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,280
look at one particle here this is a

869
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,200
differential image you can see there

870
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,400
really is a shrinking Co the particle

871
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,640
level and so the question then is is

872
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,920
this a Thermon namic process or is it a

873
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,280
kinetic one so lithium Coral oxide has a

874
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,800
two-phase reaction as a metal insulator

875
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,040
that's a theramic process but this one

876
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,319
is is a kinetic process caused by um the

877
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,920
the the diff differences in diffusivity

878
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,520
and I'll I'll show you that in a second

879
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,839
but the way to check that is just to

880
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,720
stop let the system relax and if if it

881
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,400
relaxes that indicates it's kinetic and

882
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,040
so what's going on is very similar

883
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,680
though to the lithium cobal oxide system

884
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,520
you start off your material it's stuffed

885
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,680
the lithium is not moving anywhere you

886
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,839
start pulling things lithium out from

887
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,040
the edges and again it's easier to pull

888
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:18,520
it out from the red phase and so it

889
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,640
collapses in a shrinking core mechanism

890
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,400
and what's nice is because now we have

891
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,920
the lithium diffusivity from the NMR

892
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,119
that's why I went through the exercise

893
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,400
and showed you the NMR so we had the

894
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,599
hopping Ates we know the we have the

895
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,480
hopp in frequency rather we know how

896
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,839
fast the the distance over which hop is

897
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,520
so we can then use that to calculate the

898
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:42,599
diffusivity from the NMR we can then we

899
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,119
know the the the voltage of the the

900
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,760
curve tells us the energy or the Delta G

901
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,720
associated with pulling the lithium out

902
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,079
of the structure and so we can put that

903
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,319
into a nice and continual modeling we're

904
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,359
now collaborating with Norman Fleck and

905
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:58,280
vicam dhande and Shri was the postto on

906
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:00,240
the project who built a much better

907
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,280
Continuum model of it with a particle

908
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,599
that looked like our particle and he was

909
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,800
nicely able to replicate the shrinking

910
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:10,280
core model of the system so okay so that

911
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,839
was um that was the nmc I'm now going to

912
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,520
go back to the anode and talk about um

913
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:18,040
graphite so this is a particle of

914
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,560
graphite doing its thing so this is a

915
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,560
stage two to stage one and you know it's

916
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,079
really beautiful you can see this

917
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,119
particle and watch the N the uh these

918
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,119
inter

919
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,560
intercalation wave mechanisms going

920
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,720
through it um and then you can watch the

921
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,240
end process now I want to just talk walk

922
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,440
you through this one more time so this

923
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,200
is the intensity there's not a lot going

924
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,599
on and then suddenly but you can see the

925
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,599
stuff going on I'm going to unpick that

926
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:50,200
in a minute and then it suddenly changes

927
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:53,480
when you go from a stage two to Stage 2

928
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,839
L to two um so let's just look at what

929
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,000
that graphite is so this is the icecat

930
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,359
image this is the SE M and you look at

931
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,960
that particle and you think it's

932
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:05,319
actually a pretty uh single grain

933
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,280
material but yet when you unpick it like

934
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,560
this there are multiple domains within

935
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,640
it so what can we actually do with this

936
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:16,480
ice capap for graphite so Millie in her

937
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,839
solidate Physics course for the MIT

938
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,920
undergraduates nicely explain what's

939
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,440
going on here so you've got uh dramatic

940
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,960
change in the conductivity as you go

941
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,560
from the dilute stage to the dense

942
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,160
stages so the conductivity goes up and

943
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,280
so the polarizability changes and you

944
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,720
get this very large change in the

945
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,240
scattering and that's exactly what

946
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,319
you're seeing

947
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,000
here um so what can you do in terms of

948
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:44,240
using this information so this movie is

949
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,319
a new one that never works so you can

950
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,440
explore nucleation so this is uh at low

951
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:51,240
temperature and if you watch you can see

952
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,760
that there's sort of multiple nucleation

953
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,079
events if you go up in temperature if I

954
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,920
get the movie to work there are fewer

955
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,920
nucle cation but actually at the highest

956
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,480
temperature you can see it's actually

957
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,839
just a single nucleation event and so

958
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,280
the the differences in the transport of

959
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,640
the lithium ions as a function of

960
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,839
temperature have a significant impact in

961
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,480
how these materials operate but the and

962
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,720
so this is now showing you the

963
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,839
differential images so this is the stage

964
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,000
I was talking about so this is two stage

965
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,319
two to one and if you just take

966
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,359
snapshots you can see these

967
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:28,119
intercalation waves moving across and so

968
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,160
this all makes sense this is this um

969
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,000
this been described well by particularly

970
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,760
some papers by Martin bant but the one

971
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,760
that's completely different is what's

972
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,079
going on here and if you look at the

973
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,960
individual domains you can actually see

974
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,480
that there's domains being lithiated R

975
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,440
semi randomly and continuously so if

976
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,040
you're epileptic please look away in the

977
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,960
next image because this is what's known

978
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,400
as a differential image and it's

979
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,400
flashing and so this is the domain in

980
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,280
the first stages and you're seeing these

981
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,200
events of different layers looking as if

982
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,040
they're almost uncorrelated as the

983
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,800
different layers are being filled and

984
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,800
you can track the correlations between

985
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,599
them and there's definitely

986
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,440
relationships of one following another

987
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,160
but if you look at the intensities it's

988
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,720
not a smooth solid solution as the

989
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,520
electrochemical profile would suggest is

990
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,880
these little series of

991
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,880
steps and what those little series of

992
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,480
steps correspond to is the individual

993
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,359
filling of one layer at a time which we

994
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,800
can actually see step by step in these

995
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,720
simulations and

996
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,160
so in retrospect like all experiments

997
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,280
this is obvious but actually previously

998
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,319
people just thought about this a sort of

999
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,359
uh solid solution process and it sort of

1000
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:44,359
starts to resolve the questions people

1001
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,359
have in terms of how do you go from

1002
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:50,079
alternating three layers to two layers

1003
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,640
and to four layers or vice versa and we

1004
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,079
can model this with I won't go into

1005
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,680
great detail but we can model it with a

1006
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:58,440
very simple ising model with different

1007
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,520
degrees of relationships between the

1008
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:06,119
layers and also um defects within the

1009
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,160
layers and this is for um reminiscence

1010
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,520
of something called Avalanche Behavior

1011
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,599
which you know all know what Avalanche

1012
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,960
is something goes and it suddenly goes

1013
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,359
and it's associated with the sort of

1014
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,680
pinning in the layers and then once

1015
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:18,079
you've overcome that activation barrier

1016
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,920
then the whole thing goes and you get

1017
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,520
these types of characteristic phase

1018
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,079
transitions so it's interesting it's a

1019
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,760
totally different mechanism for graphite

1020
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,880
that despite this material having been

1021
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,480
worked on for many many years hasn't

1022
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,160
been seen

1023
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,440
before so let's just think about why we

1024
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,640
can't charge faster so I've talked about

1025
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,160
uh the nmc materials and the lco

1026
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,480
materials and as long as you're working

1027
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,680
in the right regime uh between about 20%

1028
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,200
and 70% actually the lithium Mobility is

1029
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,920
pretty good so why can't we just charge

1030
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,440
our batteries infinitely fast well uh

1031
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,160
this is a Samsung cell that we put 10

1032
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,440
amps through uh for one minute and this

1033
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,720
is not a recommended experiment um heat

1034
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,079
thing and it goes to above 60° very

1035
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,760
quickly and the 60° is the temperature

1036
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,040
at which the seci the passivation layer

1037
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,880
starts to um fall a bit to fall apart

1038
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,079
the cathode when it's oxidized is

1039
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,400
metastable and things go horribly wrong

1040
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,079
the other thing is something we like um

1041
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,839
from an experimental point of view is if

1042
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,520
you charge too fast instead of intercol

1043
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,720
nicely into graphite you form these

1044
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,160
dendrites these dendrites look very

1045
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,800
beautiful but they also have caused

1046
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,960
incidents like like the Dreamliner plane

1047
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,200
was at least thought to be associated

1048
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,280
with a dendr incident so we do a nice

1049
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,720
NMR we can track our dendrites by NMR

1050
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,000
and so the thing about NMR is that it

1051
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,760
only has a certain depth it can go

1052
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,119
through a metal called a skin depth and

1053
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,880
that allows us to track the dendrites

1054
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,359
being formed so this is the dendrites

1055
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,599
forming this is the passivating SE

1056
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,400
forming on top that we can track so we

1057
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:56,280
can do beautiful experiments we can do

1058
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,160
magnetic resonance imaging experiments

1059
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,480
and we can track them as they're forming

1060
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,760
and we can relate that to the seci

1061
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,480
formation so that's all nice from a sort

1062
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,880
of uh from from an experimental

1063
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,319
perspective but it doesn't really help

1064
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,119
us in terms of the fast charging uh this

1065
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,079
is now more recent experiments where

1066
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,319
we're looking at the full cells we've

1067
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,680
got our nmc material we've got the

1068
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,640
graphite and we're looking at charging

1069
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,319
and we're charging at um at increasingly

1070
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,920
low temperatures and you can see at low

1071
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,760
temperatures you're forming lithium

1072
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,680
plating and this lithium plating issue

1073
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,800
is why in regenerative braking you can't

1074
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,559
utilize all of the kinetic energy to

1075
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,040
charge your battery because of this

1076
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:40,119
worry about lithium plating so how do we

1077
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,680
design for fast charging well we have to

1078
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,240
find a material that operates at a high

1079
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,280
enough voltage to avoid the lithium

1080
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,720
plating and it has to have high lithium

1081
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,400
mobility and the sort of prototype

1082
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,280
material that many of us as material

1083
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,559
scientists would think about would be a

1084
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,480
a a proide structure or arenium trioxide

1085
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,440
structure it's got lots of holes why

1086
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,400
can't we use it and the problem with it

1087
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,839
is that lithium is too small for most3

1088
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,160
structures and so the units rotate and

1089
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,440
they clamp the lithiums in place so

1090
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,760
lithium arenium oxide is a Terri even

1091
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,319
despite its price is a terrible battery

1092
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,960
material so what you can do is to think

1093
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,359
about how you pillar the structures to

1094
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,520
prevent those rotations and so you can

1095
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,040
take a material and you can conceptually

1096
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,640
do a shearing operation so we fuse the

1097
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,880
oct together and when you do that you

1098
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:34,760
put a lithium inside you can no longer

1099
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,480
rotate so um you can just formally

1100
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,079
imagine that and it's stuck and you can

1101
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,400
do it in two dimensions and that's when

1102
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,640
you get this hnv 205 phase and you form

1103
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,480
these blocks and again the lithium is

1104
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,480
really there it's rigid and you get in

1105
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,599
principle get very lith rapid lithium

1106
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,240
mobility and so that's what my former

1107
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,640
student Kent Griffiths did he went

1108
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,119
through a whole series of different

1109
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,280
compounds and the best in class he

1110
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:01,599
discovered in his PhD was this nium 16

1111
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,119
w5055 which for obvious reasons is

1112
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,359
abbreviated NWO and so this has a block

1113
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,040
structure of

1114
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:10,760
4x5 and it has a very high rate and so

1115
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,119
with very little optimization he was

1116
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:16,240
able to get a 20c rate so 20c rate is a

1117
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:18,400
a 3 minute charge and the thing that's

1118
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,240
limiting that is not the material itself

1119
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,559
it's the um the lithium metal that he's

1120
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,599
charging it against and again with very

1121
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,280
little optimization he was able to get

1122
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,800
materials that were lasting for a very

1123
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,200
long time and so then we can ask the

1124
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,000
question why does it work so one way of

1125
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,040
doing that is to do Pulse Field gradient

1126
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,280
spectroscopy so you put a gradient

1127
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,240
across your material you wait for the

1128
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,680
system to move and then you quantify the

1129
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,599
Echo and you end up getting diffusion

1130
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,520
coefficients of about 10 to - 11 to 10

1131
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,720
-3 M s/s so let's just reflect for a few

1132
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,319
minutes on what that means so let's

1133
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,880
compare our materials with the common

1134
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,599
other conductors so if you're a liquid

1135
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,680
electrolyte your diffusivity is about 10

1136
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:02,440
to the minus 10 so if you're trying to

1137
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:06,160
do a three minute charge it means you

1138
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:09,000
can move about 330 microns in that 3

1139
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,079
minutes so you can move from one side to

1140
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,800
the other side of a battery so battery

1141
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:15,680
electrodes are about 150 microns or 100

1142
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,640
microns depending on whether you're

1143
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,720
optimizing for power energy density but

1144
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,800
if you're a graphite and this is the 10

1145
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,079
the minus5 that I showed you earlier on

1146
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,640
the talk that means that in 3 minutes

1147
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,240
you can only move a micron and so you've

1148
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,640
got issues again of the plating that I

1149
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,160
was talking about and so you need to

1150
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,800
sort of nanosiz to get the rates but if

1151
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,800
you're an NWO you can move 33 microns

1152
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,920
which you can means you can move make

1153
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,720
these chunky monster particles that we

1154
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,720
made and you don't have to Nano size

1155
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,720
reducing cost and reducing degradation

1156
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,599
so that was fun not only do they move

1157
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,520
fast you also get very good electronic

1158
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:58,880
conduction because you've got these

1159
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,319
uh Edge sharing uh octahedra that go

1160
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,640
down the material in the direction of

1161
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,960
the tunnel and if you do DFT

1162
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,720
calculations you end up with these the

1163
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
first electron goes into these block

1164
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,920
orbitals where you have at low

1165
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,319
temperates antiferromagnetic coupled

1166
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,599
electrons in in one block and the other

1167
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:16,960
one but the second one forms a band and

1168
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,200
it becomes

1169
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:23,040
metallic and so then this is now the

1170
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,680
same picture of the NWO the same um Now

1171
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,079
battery of arm battery um and 100

1172
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,400
seconds you can see it only goes 40° and

1173
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,720
then it's put into a Dyson vacuum

1174
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,520
cleaner before Dyson went off to

1175
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,720
Singapore I wouldn't do this anymore but

1176
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,520
anyway Second Story and now this is uh

1177
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:43,920
it's in a startup company niol and this

1178
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:46,400
is um little uh robot charger that can

1179
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,920
go to your car or can go to a somewhere

1180
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,040
in need charging and then this is a

1181
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,800
cheaper variant that's now in a in a car

1182
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,640
so there just an illustration of going

1183
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,640
from from the fundamental through to

1184
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,760
Applications I want to end with one

1185
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,960
quick story do I have five minutes yeah

1186
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:07,880
um with again to return to the sort of

1187
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,720
theory of of the the theme of graphite

1188
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,359
and Millie dressle Houser but this is an

1189
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:15,000
even older story so I I um I've been

1190
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,839
trying to like many people in this

1191
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
audience really understand what is the

1192
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,000
nature of the passivating layer that

1193
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,720
grows on both graphite and lithium metal

1194
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,640
and I thought well I could go back to

1195
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,760
this very early experiment of Albert

1196
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,599
overhauser so chemists may have come

1197
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,000
across something called a nosy or a

1198
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,839
nuclear overhouse effect and we all

1199
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,520
imagin that this was invented for

1200
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:39,559
organic chemistry and biology biology

1201
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,839
but actually Albert overhauser many

1202
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:46,480
years ago said you could actually uh zap

1203
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:49,200
the uh electron spinner radiation and if

1204
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,839
you looked at the energy levels of your

1205
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,760
uh a couple system in lithium so you

1206
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,839
looked at the lithium spin so the

1207
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,880
lithium is is the um this spin here and

1208
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:01,760
you looked at the electron ones if you

1209
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,880
radiated the electron spin resonance and

1210
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,280
you had the right relaxation mechanisms

1211
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,920
namely this relaxation mechanism was

1212
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,480
faster than the other ones you could

1213
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,799
actually enhance the magnetization of um

1214
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,520
lithium metal so this was in 53 he was

1215
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:19,280
in um Illinois and his colleague down

1216
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,599
the road or down the in the next

1217
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,960
apartment uh replicated this experiment

1218
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:27,079
um the same year so this is an

1219
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,680
experiment by Tom Carver and Charlie

1220
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:33,480
slier and what he did was he um had

1221
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,119
little bits of lithium metal in a dilute

1222
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,680
Matrix and he got this massive

1223
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,960
enhancement of 110 and the signal so

1224
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,480
he's down at um 3 millitesla so very low

1225
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,079
frequencies and he didn't even get the

1226
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,280
signal of lithium metal without in

1227
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,200
radiating he worked it out based on

1228
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,280
comparing of proton experiment so this

1229
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,839
was sort of experiments of 1953 and I

1230
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,359
thought well maybe we could do this in

1231
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,760
2023

1232
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:05,200
or 2020 more accurately and so but since

1233
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:06,960
then um we've upped our fields and

1234
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,720
people like Bob Griffin in the chemistry

1235
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,079
Department have worked a lot on this

1236
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,799
method called Dynamic nuclear

1237
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:17,280
polarization or or dnp and the challenge

1238
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:19,400
has been to try and find uh gyrotrons or

1239
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,160
mechanisms for uh radiating the

1240
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,920
electrons at these much higher Fields

1241
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,760
because of the the the the the um

1242
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,520
difficulties of using microwave

1243
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,400
technology and so here we are in 19 20

1244
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,119
in 2020 and we've got an enhancement of

1245
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,559
eight and it's not because we're

1246
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,520
particularly pathetic it's because we

1247
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,559
just don't have the same high power as

1248
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,559
in low fuels but it's exciting we can

1249
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,760
partially saturate it but the most

1250
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:46,640
interesting thing was we could also

1251
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,480
polarize the signal of the SEI so the

1252
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,119
covering of that that lithium metal and

1253
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,119
so then the question is what can we do

1254
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,359
with this and so the first question we

1255
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,520
had was one associated with what is so

1256
00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:00,640
people um better galance group is a

1257
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,359
particular Pioneer in this area have

1258
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,880
spent a lot of time trying to work out

1259
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:06,640
what's in this SEI and they quantify

1260
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,040
different parts and you can do XPS and

1261
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,599
you can sort of go down to deeper levels

1262
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,079
but what's really difficult is to really

1263
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,440
look at that interface between the

1264
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,520
lithium metal in the SEI but we can do

1265
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,839
this directly and so in this experiment

1266
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,799
we um transferred the polarization we

1267
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,280
enhanced the lithium signal and then we

1268
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:25,720
transferred it to the Florine and

1269
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,720
surpris surprisingly there was no

1270
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,359
lithium fluoride and lithium fluorides

1271
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,880
has been thought to be the sort of major

1272
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,520
critical component of the of the se but

1273
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,160
there isn't any but if you add an

1274
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,599
additive like FEC which is this

1275
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,119
fluorinated carbonate then L and behold

1276
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,559
you have some lithium

1277
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,359
fluoride so then just a sort of end well

1278
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:46,040
what about graphite so graphite because

1279
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,760
it's conducting here's the ESR signal

1280
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,319
without going into all the details it's

1281
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,040
conducting it has this daian line shape

1282
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,280
it's all very well discussed in this

1283
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,760
beautiful review article of Millie in

1284
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,960
1981

1285
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,000
uh you can separate the different line

1286
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,640
shapes depending on the conductivity for

1287
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,520
the different stages and

1288
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:11,319
um uh sorry this my student put in this

1289
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,880
massive image of this is a graphite and

1290
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:15,160
this little arrow is meant to show you

1291
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,000
that in there some dendrites so they're

1292
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,000
very difficult to see but you can see

1293
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,520
them beautifully by the ESR so here's

1294
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,799
the signal of the lithium L I6 and

1295
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,920
here's the dite signal and what that

1296
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:30,160
means is you can irradiate selectiv

1297
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:32,200
either the lic6 or the lithium dendrite

1298
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,720
and you can enhance this passivating

1299
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,040
layer on either the carbon or the

1300
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,440
lithium metal and so this is an example

1301
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,079
where we're radiating the lithium metal

1302
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,559
and you see we're getting these massive

1303
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:45,400
enhancements of that lithium metal and

1304
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:47,720
smaller ones of the lithium carbon

1305
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,040
itself and so what that then allows us

1306
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,920
to do is to ask the question how does

1307
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:56,920
the SE differ on Li I6 versus lithium

1308
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,319
metal and the source of information we

1309
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,000
can get out is that this is on the

1310
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:03,559
lithium metal that the signal closest to

1311
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,280
the lithium metal is a lithium oxide

1312
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:07,240
there's probably saw some also some

1313
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,240
acetylene systems there they all

1314
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,799
resonate in this neck of the woods it's

1315
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,640
very similar to what betters group has

1316
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:17,520
seen and if you look at the um the

1317
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,440
lithium Li I6 the lith there's lithium

1318
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,359
hydroxides that are present in the

1319
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,119
lithium metal but not in the LI I6 and

1320
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:26,760
so we're now in the process of using

1321
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:29,160
this method to really unpick uh what a

1322
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,160
lot of the speciation is and so with

1323
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,680
that I think I'm sort of more or less on

1324
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,960
time um I'd like to end by just here's

1325
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,920
the full Cell lithium cobal oxide that I

1326
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,760
started off with the Sony rocking chair

1327
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,920
battery with the lithium cobal oxide on

1328
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,359
one side and the graphite on the other

1329
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,160
side so that's for the sort of

1330
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:48,960
entertainment while you're if while I

1331
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,480
finish off the conclusions so I think I

1332
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,040
hope I've Illustrated that we've

1333
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,720
developed all of these different insitu

1334
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,839
or operando metrologies from NMR to MRI

1335
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,720
to these now Optical methods which have

1336
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:04,680
allowed us to really unpick fundamental

1337
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:07,040
processes at the atomistic all the way

1338
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,520
through to the particle level and then

1339
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,920
in the fast charging example I by

1340
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,839
illustrat that we could then pull

1341
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,400
through some of this understanding to

1342
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:16,720
try and make some technology uh and then

1343
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,240
more recently we've been trying to

1344
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,319
develop these methods to actually look

1345
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:24,119
at interfaces and trying to design

1346
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:26,760
approaches where we can enhance specific

1347
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,960
parts of the signal and so in this DN P

1348
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,920
example that's one where we can radiate

1349
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,119
specifically the electrons in one

1350
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,799
component over the other and really use

1351
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:40,040
that to try and understand the metal uh

1352
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:43,000
diamagnetic interface

1353
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:45,359
and obviously we can look at interfacial

1354
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,319
processes by electron microscopy but

1355
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,319
it's very difficult often to get the

1356
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:51,720
chemical specificity and so hopefully

1357
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:53,680
some of these NMR experiments allow you

1358
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,040
to do that and of course this wouldn't

1359
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,280
be possible without my great research

1360
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,799
group This Is Us on a hiking trip uh a

1361
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,280
couple of years ago um I've mentioned a

1362
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,599
few people on the way but I want to

1363
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,000
really highlight olle and barish who

1364
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:11,559
started the insitu NMR the N nmc work

1365
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,400
was chiao Chu and Katarina Amer and Phil

1366
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:15,920
Reeves the niobates was really pioneered

1367
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,640
by Kent Griffiths who's now on the

1368
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,119
faculty at UC San Diego with Lauren

1369
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:26,319
Mella who did a lot of the PFG she's at

1370
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:28,640
um Colombia um the DFT I had a lot of um

1371
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:31,520
collaborations with Andrew Morris uh

1372
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,520
rangi and Anna and span the dendrites

1373
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,799
the ice scat was a really a lovely

1374
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:39,039
collaboration involving a raal and Alice

1375
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:42,480
the former PhD student with chrish

1376
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:45,960
nedman a postdoc and Norman and Shri and

1377
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,039
Dave Hall and and Norman Fleck did the

1378
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,799
modeling with me dnp DD wrinkle and Mike

1379
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:54,440
hope and super caps um the whole large

1380
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:56,359
team but largely Alex force and my

1381
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,150
collaborator Don Franco and thank you

1382
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:05,559
very much for listening to

1383
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:09,160
[Applause]

1384
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:11,280
me cl thank you so much um that was

1385
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:15,079
extraordinary talk uh what is going to

1386
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,000
follow uh is uh Professor yebing Chen is

1387
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:19,079
going to have a brief chat with you uh

1388
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,480
so please join him on the stage okay

1389
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:23,480
thank you on the stage

1390
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,240
now I I understand that the audience has

1391
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,680
the ability to post questions there we

1392
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,280
go all right wonderful and so while

1393
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,079
you're thinking about your questions and

1394
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,240
posting them they'll show up here uh you

1395
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:43,319
know the the thing about Fireside Chats

1396
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,599
is you have to sit down I know sorry I

1397
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:46,760
felt a bit odd but you're not sitting

1398
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:51,000
secondly where's the

1399
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:52,640
fire uh so uh there's no battery fires

1400
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,960
no battery fires that's right that would

1401
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,960
have been a beautiful backdrop for our

1402
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:02,039
discussion here

1403
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:05,839
now um so let me kick things off and uh

1404
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:09,799
ask Claire about uh the view towards

1405
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:11,760
climate change in the UK today right so

1406
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:15,559
as you know and we discussed earlier at

1407
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:19,280
MIT we have the climate project the pan

1408
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:23,000
MIT effort uh Sally corn Bluth has

1409
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:27,200
doubled down on climate uh since the

1410
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:30,400
last Administration Raphael r's and so

1411
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:33,839
this is going to happen at MIT and we

1412
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,079
had an election a we week or so ago uh

1413
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,200
that's not going to affect what we do

1414
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:41,799
here at MIT to any significant extent I

1415
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:44,200
believe right now um what I want to ask

1416
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:48,640
you is you know what's the view in the

1417
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:51,359
UK you know at the student level at the

1418
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,319
um university level uh what's the

1419
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:57,680
climate on climate

1420
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:59,839
change I mean I I think the the UK is I

1421
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,440
mean I think the distinction in the UK

1422
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:04,160
is pretty clearcut that it's in law

1423
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,880
climate we have to phase out the

1424
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,319
electric vehicles by the end of the

1425
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,599
decade and that's now legislation now

1426
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:13,640
whether it happens is another matter but

1427
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:15,760
that so that has frames the conversation

1428
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,760
very differently than particularly in

1429
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,480
the US and now and I mean maybe that was

1430
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,240
different two weeks ago but you have a

1431
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,920
very act active student body and you

1432
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:29,000
have these sectors in the UK Society we

1433
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,960
have Extinction Rebellion we have these

1434
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,720
these are the people who have been

1435
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,480
variants of Extinction Rebellion who've

1436
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,240
been gluing themselves to parts of the

1437
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,720
equivalent of I95 and the train stations

1438
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,799
and so it's a very active body I mean we

1439
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,319
are as a university we're not um not

1440
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:49,440
allowed to accept money now from fossil

1441
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,559
fuel companies yes so that you mentioned

1442
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,720
that earlier and that's a pretty

1443
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,720
dramatic move and and that's coming from

1444
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,920
the students that is not something that

1445
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,480
the you know the academic

1446
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,240
are there's some very disperate opinions

1447
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,640
on it but it's the students who pushed

1448
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:07,440
it and it's part of the

1449
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:10,520
protests but so our students are

1450
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:14,480
quite quite strong in in in in the

1451
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:17,400
lobbying groups now in terms of the

1452
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:20,920
University we have Cambridge zero which

1453
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:24,359
is our sort of umbrella Organization for

1454
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,720
action but it's very much policy and the

1455
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:29,400
environment is headed by a woman from

1456
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,240
the British Antarctic Survey and that's

1457
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,079
very much shaped what she's interested

1458
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:36,079
in doing and so we've been weaker on the

1459
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,000
tech although that's something we're

1460
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,799
trying to do at the moment because we

1461
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,880
have a very strong track record and a

1462
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:46,880
lot of energy systems but I think you

1463
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,200
know MIT does these things well partly

1464
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,440
because it always has more money or at

1465
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,440
least that's the perception from the

1466
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:57,319
outside that you may disagree with that

1467
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:59,079
um well um you did say that that I asked

1468
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:00,640
you earlier today when we met you know

1469
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:04,359
so what do you see as the difference and

1470
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:07,680
you said in the UK we do much of the

1471
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:11,520
same thing just with less money exactly

1472
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,559
yeah and so and also you have a and I'm

1473
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,599
not saying that's a virtue is a reality

1474
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:17,160
you know I would be very happy if it

1475
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:21,359
that's right maybe you're more efficient

1476
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:26,039
yes uh there there's also uh the rest of

1477
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:28,160
Europe whoever what is the What is the

1478
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:31,720
dynamic between the UK and the rest of

1479
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:34,599
Europe on climate these days well I mean

1480
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:36,160
you know the you have the election last

1481
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:38,440
week as the elephant in the room of

1482
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,920
course we have brexit as the the

1483
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:43,400
elephant that sort of floats around

1484
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:47,000
somewhere in the channel

1485
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:49,880
um so because we've in the last few

1486
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,319
years been part of this negotiation to

1487
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:56,440
um be part of horizon 2020 which is the

1488
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:59,160
funding mechanism from Europe and the EU

1489
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:01,160
um link that with immigration so it was

1490
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,440
almost used funding was used as this

1491
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,200
sort of um thing to beat the UK over but

1492
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,839
anyway we're back we're in hor Horizon

1493
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,640
20 and we're very much trying to give

1494
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:13,200
the impression of being outward facing

1495
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,440
and being wanting to um collaborate and

1496
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,359
so that's been a ma major Focus to

1497
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,440
reestablish the networks that were

1498
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:21,760
broken as part of the the whole brexit

1499
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,280
period because there was this time where

1500
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,440
most of the time we could be a part of

1501
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,280
it but we couldn't lead any

1502
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,920
collaboration so so that's that's from a

1503
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,280
sort of um from an academic perspective

1504
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:37,920
I think the whole other perspective is

1505
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:39,640
the industrial one so because of brexit

1506
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,039
you know we don't have an ability to

1507
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,359
trade freely but yet the reality is that

1508
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:47,280
a company that makes something in the UK

1509
01:01:44,359 --> 01:01:50,599
the EU is their major trading block and

1510
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,160
so you have to uh in the same way that

1511
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,839
the US if you're making something one

1512
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,640
state you still have to obey

1513
01:01:54,839 --> 01:02:00,039
California's emission requirements so

1514
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,880
there's an incentive to obey the

1515
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:04,359
requirements of the whole of the US in

1516
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:06,319
the UK is there's an incentive to obey

1517
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:08,680
the regulations of the EU and thing we

1518
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:10,799
talked about earlier on is the need to

1519
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,880
you know manufacture as much as possible

1520
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:16,000
within Europe right so that's

1521
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:20,359
influencing a lot of policy influencing

1522
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,920
the need to have materials that come

1523
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:24,559
from within Europe and of course people

1524
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,319
have been to Europe we're not a country

1525
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,279
full of minds and there's not a lot of

1526
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:30,079
Natural Resources so there are a number

1527
01:02:28,279 --> 01:02:33,200
of parallels here that you've pointed

1528
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:36,480
out now so back to the industrial aspect

1529
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,680
so U I may be a bit of an outlier but I

1530
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,079
think that uh with just our election is

1531
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,359
probably not going to change the

1532
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:48,640
progress of uh climate mitigation

1533
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:52,680
Technologies as much as some think for a

1534
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:54,680
couple of reasons one is 2016 to 2020

1535
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,119
there was actually a very fertile period

1536
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,640
for both the development new technology

1537
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:03,000
and creation of new companies here in

1538
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:05,279
the US and here we are in 2024 and a

1539
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,599
number of those companies now have grown

1540
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:11,119
to the point where the economic benefits

1541
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:13,279
are seen and those economic benefits for

1542
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,160
instance in manufacturing are

1543
01:03:13,279 --> 01:03:19,559
predominantly in red States and so where

1544
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:23,160
you know job creation is taking place

1545
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:26,240
you what we're seeing now is that

1546
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:29,920
politics are put aside and better jobs

1547
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:33,799
for example more jobs better jobs are

1548
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:36,000
carrying the discussion uh in the UK and

1549
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:38,680
in I would say in Europe more broadly

1550
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,760
are you starting do you see uh those

1551
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,119
economic benefits from the energy

1552
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:45,200
transition yet yeah I think it's a

1553
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,680
really good point and I but I think the

1554
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:51,279
the distinction is that the US has been

1555
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:53,760
better the UK has been dragged down by

1556
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:57,359
brexit and that has made a difference

1557
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,240
the economy and Europe hasn't bounced

1558
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:01,559
back with the same speed after the

1559
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:04,839
pandemic as the US and so that's

1560
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:07,359
dampened a lot of this and I think but

1561
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:09,920
it what it's made um an issue that I

1562
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:12,680
think is very relevant to the us as well

1563
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,920
is make trying to think about how the

1564
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:18,079
transition to a more sustainable um

1565
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:20,480
economy is for everyone and it's not

1566
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,799
just those who can afford their Teslas

1567
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,880
or the equivalent and I think that and

1568
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,720
in the UK you have talk about the red

1569
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,400
States and the blue States we talk about

1570
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,720
the north south divide and it was the

1571
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:35,319
leveling up agenda which was the term

1572
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:37,880
that was introduced by Boris Johnson who

1573
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:40,680
we can discuss that with that they're

1574
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:42,640
leveling up they even created an agency

1575
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,680
for leveling up that that's been got rid

1576
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,760
of but it doesn't it

1577
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:52,960
nonetheless the labor is under even more

1578
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:55,119
a political um challenge because the

1579
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,279
labor party which was out of office for

1580
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,160
so many years

1581
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:01,720
didn't get in because the traditional

1582
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:04,000
labor areas in the north of England all

1583
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:05,839
voted for the conservatives and so

1584
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,480
that's hampering them even more so it's

1585
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:10,920
this balance between how do you how do

1586
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,960
you do what's actually in law which is

1587
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,760
to as I said to to think about removing

1588
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:19,680
electric vehic sorry removing petrol

1589
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,799
cars gasoline cars sorry um and rolling

1590
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,599
electric vehicles and then trucks are

1591
01:05:21,799 --> 01:05:28,200
next yet doing this in an economy that

1592
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:30,279
is is not as vibrant as this country so

1593
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,839
I think that's it's that's what's making

1594
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:36,039
labor the labor diffic um the labor

1595
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,839
government it putting it in a very

1596
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:39,279
difficult spot and they you know they

1597
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:42,039
want they've wanted to be more

1598
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:44,000
transparent but you know it's it's not

1599
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:46,200
easy so I don't know if I answered your

1600
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,240
question I think so I think it would be

1601
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:52,200
great if there are more companies in the

1602
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:54,799
U UK in the same way that start to see

1603
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,319
this as a way of of to be blunt making

1604
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:58,799
money I mean

1605
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:01,520
yeah and and you had mentioned me

1606
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:04,000
earlier that the rpe model for example

1607
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:08,559
is being exported to the UK currently

1608
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,200
yeah even with RP people but yeah again

1609
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,279
as I said to you earlier on with smaller

1610
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,680
numbers but what's interesting uh unlike

1611
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:17,359
and maybe I'm wrong that because I've

1612
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:20,400
now been outside the US for long that

1613
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:23,799
there is also more of a model to have

1614
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,319
rpe type projects involve Africa and

1615
01:06:23,799 --> 01:06:29,480
other parts of the world to think about

1616
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:31,319
democratization of energy and so the and

1617
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,279
that may be that the funding model is

1618
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:36,680
different this m the UK traditionally

1619
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:38,839
has put more money in Aid and some of

1620
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:40,520
that Aid funding has been associated

1621
01:06:38,839 --> 01:06:44,160
with science and so some of that's been

1622
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,880
folded into the um to to our RP which I

1623
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:49,200
think is also interesting great thank

1624
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,279
you for that and so uh feel free to

1625
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,599
submit questions and you know we can go

1626
01:06:51,279 --> 01:06:55,880
back to some you can ask some more

1627
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,720
technical question if You' like as well

1628
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,680
oh vadir do we have to stop uh no we we

1629
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,640
have a couple more minutes uh just raise

1630
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,440
your hand if you have a question because

1631
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,680
the is not behaving the way we expected

1632
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,079
okay but and while we wait for that I

1633
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,640
have I I want to ask you a little more a

1634
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,960
somewhat more personal question here so

1635
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:18,440
you know you and I met in uh almost 30

1636
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:21,000
years ago and I believe that you know at

1637
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:24,000
the time you had left to Pont and were

1638
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,680
an assistant professor at Stony Brook

1639
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,119
and you know we're now both both

1640
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:33,480
considerably older and now you're U Dame

1641
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:35,720
Professor Claire gray right and uh you

1642
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,920
know I want to ask you you know what's

1643
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,720
that like I mean when students come into

1644
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,720
your office now uh how do they address

1645
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,640
you do they have to bow do they have to

1646
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,200
say they bow

1647
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:50,880
bow tell us about

1648
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:53,200
that oh they bow yeah

1649
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,440
totally I mean what is there to say

1650
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,359
about it I mean it's a slightly

1651
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,160
embarrassing title

1652
01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:02,960
and I um and I went through um I did

1653
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,839
look there's a website of people who you

1654
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,440
were Ned right so nighted is still the

1655
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:09,079
right phrase

1656
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,559
yeah yeah it is actually it is yes it's

1657
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:13,760
just that the men get men are called

1658
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:15,920
their nights and they get

1659
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,239
swords they get given a sword but the

1660
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,640
women get off so you didn't get the

1661
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:22,040
sword no sword

1662
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,679
yeah anyway there's a website of people

1663
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:26,560
who said no but I in the end I decided

1664
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:28,199
you know they're not many women

1665
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,400
scientists who get this honor so I

1666
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:32,880
should just embrace it but it's okay

1667
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,199
it's a wonderful honor and you should

1668
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,199
embrace it I think it's wonderful so

1669
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,199
congratulations on

1670
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:46,719
that all right do we have some questions

1671
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:54,080
hands one oh Lynn Professor Lyn hops

1672
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:56,799
please I I just have a a very small

1673
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:00,319
really drle house yeah I have a small

1674
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:01,960
Millie dressle house related comment um

1675
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,520
uh she and I and some others were

1676
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:06,759
working on elect transmission electron

1677
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,920
microscopy of of the lithium

1678
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:12,239
interpolation of graphite back in 1981

1679
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:16,040
which is when some of your comments were

1680
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:19,400
addressed initially and um those studies

1681
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:22,120
were beveled by the unavoidable but

1682
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:24,679
indeterminate Electron Beam Heating in

1683
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,880
the electron microscope and so I was

1684
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:28,040
extraordinary

1685
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,640
excited in the Imaging methods you've

1686
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,480
dreamed up um which enable you to look

1687
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,359
at the temperature dependence which is

1688
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:38,199
clearly hugely hugely important uh in

1689
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,400
these classes of materials and in this

1690
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:43,600
kind of

1691
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:43,600
technique thankk thank you thank

1692
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
you

1693
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:56,040
please hi uh my name is Jacob seagull um

1694
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:59,320
after your work with graphine doing with

1695
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,560
uh nitrogen do you see that if graphine

1696
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,520
Purity increases and Manufacturing

1697
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,800
techniques are improved that it would be

1698
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,480
viable material for the

1699
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,600
cathode so you're saying so do I think

1700
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:14,120
nitrogen dope graphin would be good for

1701
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:16,400
a cathode yeah yeah they I mean most

1702
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:20,239
graphites even with nitrogen they'll be

1703
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:22,960
down on the anode side so um I think

1704
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:24,840
it'll be an anoe um you know the problem

1705
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,920
you always have is that graphite is so

1706
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:30,600
good

1707
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:33,080
mhm and if you put nitrogen in there it

1708
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:36,640
it could in the in the application I

1709
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:38,280
told you of super caps where um where

1710
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,280
you're just storing things on a double

1711
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,400
layer and you've got solvated ions if

1712
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,560
you start putting in defects anything

1713
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,280
that pulls the irons closer together

1714
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,080
gives you higher capacitance so I'd

1715
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,360
probably look for it in that sort of

1716
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,960
application I mean there is some you

1717
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,880
know people do talk about nitrogen dope

1718
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,480
Boron dop graphin and graphites but the

1719
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,560
problem with batteries is you just want

1720
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:02,560
stuff and anything that's fluffy you

1721
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,440
know is is bad and anything that's more

1722
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:09,040
fluffy of higher surface areas more

1723
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:13,000
degradation so I say do a super cap okay

1724
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:14,920
you know maybe I can yeah you can just

1725
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,600
take that question and add a question on

1726
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:19,360
top of your question is very graphite is

1727
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,800
great but it's a little too close to the

1728
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:25,520
lithium metal potential

1729
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,440
fortly why is it in lithium ion battery

1730
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,719
that we have you know lithium metal wave

1731
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,679
graphite but then the next best thing is

1732
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:35,040
lithium TI titanium oxide is all one

1733
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:37,040
volt higher BT and a half higher there

1734
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,320
and so why is this this demilitarized

1735
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,480
zone between two what we really need is

1736
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:45,560
something that's about 3/4 of a vault

1737
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:48,800
off of lithium there's vanadates so

1738
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:52,199
they're 0.9 Titan titanates

1739
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,679
0.9 um I think one of the one of the

1740
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:55,400
challenges if you look at the lithium

1741
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,440
vanadates and lithium titanates is

1742
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:00,159
you're having to make them lithiated to

1743
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:03,000
get there and they're pain to process

1744
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:05,400
you you can't do it in air so air is

1745
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
about 2.9 volts or 3 volts and so you're

1746
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,000
when you're making things you're always

1747
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,520
making things in that ox and if you're

1748
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:17,679
making it unlithiated

1749
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:20,840
your so that that's half of it and yeah

1750
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:23,280
I mean that's the periodic

1751
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,679
table well we need we clearly need

1752
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,000
another one I mean you can you know as

1753
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:28,960
your suggest you can doe graphites and

1754
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,679
but again you're you're creating

1755
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:34,840
distributions of stuff and but but I do

1756
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:36,600
think it's the it's the metal oxidation

1757
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:41,199
states that you want that get you in

1758
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:42,400
that 6. 7 you're making them lithiated

1759
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:46,960
and then it's a question of how do you

1760
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:50,520
scale it as well all right I think we

1761
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,120
are out of time unfortunately and so uh

1762
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:57,000
please join me and thank Claire again

1763
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:57,000
for a wonderful lecture and discuss

1764
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:06,280
thank you that's great there are many

1765
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:08,880
materials in the world uh at MIT we have

1766
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:11,840
an absolute pleasure of working with

1767
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,280
many many of them including glass uh so

1768
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:17,960
our students uh together with our

1769
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:19,480
amazing staff run the glass laboratory

1770
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,440
where glass is extruded in many

1771
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,040
beautiful shapes including given the

1772
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:28,400
fact that we are at the Thanksgiving

1773
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:31,000
season and uh a pumpkin is a a symbol of

1774
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,199
it uh we have made a glass pumpkin as a

1775
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,920
momento of this particular day it has a

1776
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:40,600
little MIT logo on it as well embedded

1777
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:42,880
in the glass thank you so much uh like

1778
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,450
give this to you as our very small token

1779
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:51,630
appreciation thank you so

1780
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:51,630
[Applause]

1781
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:58,080
much for
