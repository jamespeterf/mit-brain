1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,240
Um and I now we now have our our last

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,080
speaker and I believe we we start with a

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,880
video but she's available online. Is

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,199
that correct? Um, and I want to

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,119
introduce Hela Shakru, uh, who is the

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,439
head of the Middle East and Central

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,440
Asian division of the IFC, International

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:37,760
Finance Corporation, and is leading an

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,680
incredible effort um to scale uh,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,200
geothermal networks um, in her uh, uh,

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,079
country um, group. Uh, so do we have

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,440
that live?

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,280
Hello, my name is Hela Shiru. I'm the

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,199
regional vice president for the Middle

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
East and Central Asia at the

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,920
International Finance Corporation. I'm

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,719
excited to speak to you about IFC's

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,960
commitment to expand geothermal energy

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,720
networks for heating and cooling across

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,479
the Middle East and Central Asia

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,520
regions.

22
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,680
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,439
and the largest global development

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,759
institution focused on the private

25
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,640
sector in emerging markets. So

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,880
>> climate change is one of our strategic

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,119
pillars of action. We aim to drive a

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,600
transition towards a low emission and

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,159
climate resilient economic development

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,079
that prioritizes people, jobs and

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,920
sustainable growth. Leveraging

32
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,799
geothermal energy networks as a

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
sustainable, efficient solution to the

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,880
growing energy demands in the global

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
south aligns with this mission. These

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,680
are four reasons for that. First,

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,320
geothermal energy is reliable and

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,040
scalable. The substantial heat emanating

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,840
from Earth's core to its near surface

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
remains largely untapped. It is a

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,479
predictable source of energy that is not

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
weather dependent. Most geothermal

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,360
energy solutions are based on proven

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,520
technologies with long track record of

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,200
successful operating experience. It can

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,280
be utilized for various applications

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
including heating and cooling, our focus

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
today, but also in certain instances

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
water dissalination and electricity

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,760
generation if the geology allows for it.

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,640
Second, geothermal energy enhances

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,720
energy security because Earth's heat is

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,040
not a commodity that can be traded.

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,519
Geothermal energy offers us a free fuel

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,680
renewable with limited environmental

56
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,080
footprint and no emissions that is easy

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,160
to tap to. This enhances energy

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
independence of a country and reduces

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,840
pressure on the balance of payment for

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,160
energy. Third, geothermal energy is

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
truly renewable. In a world where the

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,319
majority of greenhouse gas emissions are

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,120
from the energy sector, this is both

64
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,560
affordable, reliable, and clean,

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,560
enabling a faster energy transition.

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,280
Emerging countries can address their

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,200
concerns about fuel price volatility,

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,720
supply chain disruptions due to

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,280
geopolitical conflicts and it offers a

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,760
free storage of excess heat and cold in

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,480
the geothermal bore holes. Hence, it's a

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,480
base load with storage bypassing the

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,319
weaknesses of intermittent renewable

74
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
electricity.

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,480
Finally, strengthening competitiveness

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,640
by offering a reliable, affordable, and

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,720
sustainable energy like geothermal

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,280
allows us to make a dent in reducing

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,280
poverty and mitigating climate change at

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,920
the same time.

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
This energy is available 24 hours a day,

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,640
7 days a week, making it essential for

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
economic development.

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,239
By supporting it through climate

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
finance, we can bolster local

86
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,920
entrepreneurship, local utilities, and

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,640
it is a job inensive solution, including

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,799
for transitioning workforce from

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,000
industries that rely on fossil fuels for

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,319
heating and and cooling into this clean

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,720
alternative. This is particularly

92
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:10,400
relevant for a just energy transition.

93
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,000
Heating and cooling makes up 50% of

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,920
global final energy consumption.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,880
Harnessing surface geothermal energy

96
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,919
with worked ground source heat pump

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,600
working at utility scale offers us a

98
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,000
lowcost heating and cooling solution

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,000
that will enhance our energy security,

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,400
strengthen our economic competitiveness,

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
create jobs, decrease greenhouse gas

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,199
emissions, hence benefiting both

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,280
economies and societies. The emerging

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,680
markets can benefit from strategically

105
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,639
planning geothermal rollout. The surface

106
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,639
geothermal solutions like the network

107
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,639
ground source heat pumps can be used

108
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,520
anywhere. They don't have a resource

109
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,840
risk. They save massively on electricity

110
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,840
and they reduce the bills if financed

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,800
properly. Take Jordan for example. As of

112
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,560
2021, almost 80% of its energy needs

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,680
were met through imports of natural gas

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,199
and crude oil. Heating and cooling

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
consumes a large share of its

116
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,280
electricity, stressing an aging power

117
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,440
grid. Conventional cooling systems use

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,600
significant water volumes in one of the

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,400
world's most water stressed countries,

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,080
Jordan. By moving to geothermal energy

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
networks, we can address all of these

122
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,520
challenges. There is a massive

123
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,240
efficiency rate of five times for

124
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,160
heating with geothermal and six times

125
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,120
for cooling with geothermal.

126
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,360
Scaling up utility scale ground source

127
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,199
heat pumps is a key part of IFC's

128
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,000
investment program to mitigate climate

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,600
change in the region. By developing this

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
affordable and reliable heating and

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,759
cooling model in the immediate term, we

132
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
are providing catalytic financing for

133
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,759
the preparation of demonstration

134
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,320
projects which include the following.

135
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,479
First, tailored engineering design. A

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,400
suitable site is selected. The sight

137
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,600
specific engineering design is developed

138
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,240
in accordance with the country's

139
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,960
permitting and regulatory requirements.

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,720
Second, we engage stakeholders including

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
organizing study tours for decision

142
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
makers and implementers, educational

143
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
programs for and workshops for

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,120
engineers, policy makers and the

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,080
communities. Third, we address any

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,000
remaining policy gap. We do a

147
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,680
comprehensive review for the framework,

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,160
the regulatory environment and the

149
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,080
market condition for network geothermal

150
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
system. We identify barriers,

151
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,039
opportunities and gaps and we develop

152
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,720
actionable policy uh recommendations to

153
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,479
enable a a timely uptake. Lastly, we

154
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,120
mobilize the capital to finance

155
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,840
demonstration scale up efforts. This

156
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,080
would include blended finance solutions

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,000
and solutions in local currencies for

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,520
the utilities and local corporates given

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
that their revenues will be in local

160
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,520
currency.

161
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,199
IFC is currently rolling out

162
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,080
demonstration projects in seven

163
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,840
countries all eager to see projects move

164
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,199
forward. Turkey, Pakistan, Jordan and

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,599
four Central Asian nations of

166
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,080
Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Usbakistan and

167
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
Tajkistan. These projects include those

168
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,960
previously mentioned for areas of

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,720
support and lie the foundation for a

170
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,960
fifth generation district heating and

171
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,000
cooling network system operated by

172
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,280
public or private utilities. All the

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,080
demonstration projects will be

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,560
engineered using the singlepipe ambient

175
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,720
temperature loop to provide space

176
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,319
heating and cooling to residential and

177
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
commercial consumers. Each of these

178
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,800
projects is designed to be for at least

179
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,280
3,000 units equivalent with a potential

180
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039
scale up for up to 30,000 units which is

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,599
the preference of most of the countries

182
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,440
to go big. Thank you for attending the

183
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,800
presentation. I'll be happy to answer

184
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,800
questions during the Q&A session.
