1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:25,760
So, it's my pleasure to uh to introduce

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,960
Andrew Garson uh who I had

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,320
honor and pleasure to work with

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,480
for for a long while at Morgan Stanley.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:41,440
Um and Andrew is uh actually a MIT alum.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:46,480
uh he got his PhD uh from in geo physics

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:51,360
uh from MIT. Uh and uh after that uh he

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,640
worked in a variety of uh uh roles in

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,480
financial senior quantitative roles in

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,199
financial industry and now Andrew uh is

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,439
head of quantitative strategies at

12
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,960
Mizukho in New York. So Andrew, welcome

13
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,400
and please take it away.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,400
>> Okay. Uh thanks everyone. So I'm going

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,560
to have a quick talk today about sort of

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,760
linear uh models and rates in particular

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,960
which is area I work in. Um we'll just

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,240
have a quick overview. We're going to

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,080
talk a little bit about some basic

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,759
markets. Uh interest rates, what are

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,320
they? Um what are some of the more

22
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
liquid rates products, yield curves, you

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,680
know, a little bit about hedging, how do

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,280
you hedge your positions, uh P&L

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
attribution, and then end with a little

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,360
bit on E-rading and bonds. Uh I'm going

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
to caveat this is going to be a very

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,960
non-mathy presentation probably for this

29
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,280
class. So um that's probably my personal

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,560
bias is I don't find math necessarily uh

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,920
that illuminating in some of these

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
problems versus what problems are you

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,119
actually solving. As I told Peter, you

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
know, if I was you were talking about,

35
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,840
you know, how to build a house, we

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,520
wouldn't spend, you know, 80% of the

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,640
time talking about hammers. You know,

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,640
we're talking about how big you want

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,720
your rooms and how the connectivity is.

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,079
Uh I would highly encourage you to ask

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,680
questions. I'm going to ask Peter if

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
nobody else does if he can pipe in a

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
couple just because I'd like to keep the

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,719
discussion going and I'm generally happy

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,040
to yak on and on about any particular

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,039
topic that anyone uh is interested in.

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,720
So, so please uh talk away. Okay. So,

48
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,319
start with the basics. What are linear

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,400
products? You know, they're things that

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,319
are not nonlinear. Uh nothing too

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
surprises there. Um you know, some of

52
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,520
the major categories are things like

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,760
bonds, high interest rate swaps,

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,760
interest rate future, CDs. These are

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,599
sort of the more traditional relatively

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,599
simple products. These are not you know

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,239
codo squared or colable spread range

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,319
acrals or any of the super exotic stuff

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
that has uh been around for a while and

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
still continues to be done. You know the

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
modeling is in some sense relatively

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,560
simpler here. These are not you know

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,239
huge you know multiffactor scastic

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,280
calculus models you have to do in term

65
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
structure models and things. It's

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,959
relatively straightforward you know. So

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
the question then is you know why do we

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,160
care you know as quants? Why is this

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
interesting? You know anybody want to

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,599
hazard a guess as to why the stuff is

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
still relevant today?

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,200
Somebody take a guess. Look, you look

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,319
like you're thinking.

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,400
>> I was going to say it's still related to

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,920
important stuff like interest rates.

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,519
>> It is it's it's an important thing. It's

77
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,959
the core underlying. What is what are

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,519
some other reasons? Maybe you might care

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
about this.

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,040
>> It's traded a lot.

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,200
>> It's a very big market and a very liquid

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,040
market. True. A couple other ones are

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,720
it's also generally used for hedging of

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,319
the more complicated stuff and it's also

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,599
an input to all the more complicated

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,879
models which generally you start from

87
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,400
the simple stuff and you build your

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,760
models up. Um you know these are very

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,680
large these are the largest markets on

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
the planet. Um just a couple of

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
statistics in the last few years.

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
Equities is is you know getting close

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,120
now particularly with the sort of run up

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,120
in global equities last couple years. Um

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
bonds have something north of $120

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,599
trillion outstanding. uh interest rate

97
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,440
swaps are more like you know 500 plus

98
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,440
trillion dollars outstanding you know

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,440
just the main futures contract more than

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,760
10 trillion you know these are very

101
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,000
large numbers um you don't need to have

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,959
a huge profit margin and when a market

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
this size to you know do very well in a

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
market of this size that's very actively

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,799
it trades a lot um you know the daily

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
volumes treasuries approaching a

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
trillion dollars a day uh interest rate

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,720
swaps you know comparable uh again

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,400
futures something like four million

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,160
contracts a day and the sofur futures

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,799
which are the main uh short-term

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
interest rate contracts.

113
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,160
And then I think some some a lot of the

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,759
more complicated models start with the

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,240
simple stuff and then sort of build up

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
on top of that.

117
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
And again, I have a tendency to talk

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,479
faster and faster and faster if nobody

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
comes back. So I'm going to apologize in

120
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,680
advance and if you find me doing that,

121
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,919
somebody just uh tell me to stop.

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
um you know and again I as said they

123
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,000
mentioned they're sort of uh based to

124
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,759
the compllets and uh inputs to the more

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,919
complicated model you know previously I

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,160
think they were thought quite simple uh

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,720
I think the global financial crisis in

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
2008 sort of brought a number of factors

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
to the four that people hadn't

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,199
considered before uh in particular

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,880
around things like funding

132
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
uh and what was previously say a very

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,800
simple product so you know I'll pay you

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,639
a dollar in 10 years how to value that

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,039
became quite difficult and and subject

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,600
to a a lot of uh thinking and discussion

137
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,840
and um and interesting there's not a

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
unique answer to that um which is also

139
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,880
interesting.

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
Couple of the other things that came in

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,639
there was a lot of regulation that came

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,240
in after uh 2008. Um you know some sense

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
somebody said the regulators wanted to

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
make banking boring. Um and you know

145
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
it's not boring but they've changed

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,240
where the interest is in it. um and sort

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
of the super complicated exotic products

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
that were really uh very much in vogue

149
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,160
in the early knots and midnots really

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,240
those things uh ended poorly for a lot

151
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,840
of people. uh you sort of think about

152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
the causes of the financial crisis at

153
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,479
least on on the market side a lot of it

154
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
ultimately uh boiled down to US

155
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,600
residential real estate uh which had a

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,280
huge runup and then an enormous crash

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,639
but off of that they'd been issued you

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,039
know a lot of very complicated

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,199
securization products uh very highly

160
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
levered and multi-layered uh and things

161
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,680
were you know very opaque and hard to

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,400
value you know this was not uh financial

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,440
modeling's finest hour

164
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
uh so I think there was a lot of

165
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
regulation that came in on top of that

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,440
in terms of model risk management and

167
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,280
that that really um sort of ended that

168
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
little that section of the business. So,

169
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
uh people went back a little bit to

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
basics and and started thinking a little

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
more about some of the fundamentals. Um

172
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,680
which I think was a good thing because I

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
think things were kind of silly there.

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
Uh and I remember talking to some of my

175
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,880
friends at a soccer game or something

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,240
our kids were playing and he was

177
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
mentioning they just done a mortgage

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,919
securization issue which I believe

179
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,280
defaulted without making a single

180
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,520
payment. So, this stuff was just so, you

181
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,639
know, so poorly supported and thought

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,960
out. Um, but because it was so opaque,

183
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,319
you know, you know, smiling fast

184
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,680
talkinging sales guy could push a lot of

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,960
the stuff to areas that really probably

186
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,680
should not have been involved in this

187
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,440
area. Uh, and you find little like

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
municipalities in Norway having declared

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,479
bankruptcy because they bought a whole

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
bunch of CDOS's from Iowa, you know,

191
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,440
strip malls or something crazy like that

192
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,440
and you sort of think, you know, how did

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,840
that happen? Um so I think there was

194
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,080
quite a lot of uh regulation came in

195
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,800
really to you put a little bit of fences

196
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,319
around some of this stuff which is is uh

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
you know it's quite powerful but you

198
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,720
know could be used for good or bad in

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
some sense. So

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,000
okay

201
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,000
so let's talk a little bit about what is

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,880
an interest rate. You know an interest

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,800
rate at its most basic um is a rate at

204
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,680
which you can you know either borrow or

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,639
lend money uh on a principal amount. So

206
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,560
in this case, I'm going to have, you

207
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,800
know, my interest I payment will be N,

208
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
which is a notional typically times the

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,360
rate R acrewed over whatever time I'm

210
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,639
borrowing it for. So I have, you know,

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm borrowing $1,000 at 5% for a year.

212
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,120
In a year, I'll have to pay back $1,000

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,479
plus 5% uh times a year times $1,000,

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,560
$50 of interest. Um, relatively

215
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,319
straightforward. You know, how do I

216
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
value that in terms of what I'm willing

217
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,080
to pay for that today? you know, I'm not

218
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,759
willing to pay $1,000 for it because uh

219
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
well, let me reverse that. So, if I get

220
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,599
$1,000 in a year, how much am I willing

221
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,680
to pay for that today? And whatever I'm

222
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,160
willing to pay for today, I can invest.

223
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,759
And if you work out arithmetic, it works

224
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
out to be one over one plus the rate

225
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,120
times the time. So, at a 5% rate, I'll

226
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,680
pay something like $950 odd dollars for

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,440
that. Uh and then in a year get $1,000.

228
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,520
Now, this depends a lot on the

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,240
discounting rate. for example. So, what

230
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,320
rate am I going to discount at? Um, you

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,519
know, that's hard to observe. Rates I

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,719
can get for investing are easy to

233
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
observe. You know, you walk into a bank

234
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,640
and you look at the signs on the front

235
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,039
door, IRCDs, four and a half% rates for

236
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,000
a year. Uh, whatever. How much a

237
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,000
discount is is hard.

238
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,480
Um, typically, you know, in our world,

239
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,839
we're going to assume one of the, you

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,360
know, institutional rates, which is

241
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,120
something like a sofa rate or an OS

242
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
rate, which we'll talk more about in a

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,440
little bit in the future. Um but these

244
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,880
are sort of a standard uh assumption.

245
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,800
Now one of the interesting things

246
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,560
practically you find every person has a

247
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,920
slightly different rate that they should

248
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
be discating out because it depends on

249
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,839
where they can borrow money and that

250
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,120
that depends on your creditworthiness.

251
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,880
So you know you may have a good credit

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,480
rating and you can borrow money at 4%.

253
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,519
You know you no offense I'm not picking

254
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,200
you. You may have a terrible credit

255
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,880
rating so you have to pay 8% to borrow

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,600
money. You may have a medium one so

257
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
you're borrowing at 6%. So uh and you

258
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,760
know it all depends on the particular

259
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,839
issues of the issuer. So this this makes

260
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,040
it uh interesting because at this point

261
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,880
you know the uh a contract for you guys

262
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,480
to pay me a thousand bucks in a year has

263
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,440
different prices depending on who you

264
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
are. So there's no single price here

265
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,720
makes it interesting. Uh a lot of the

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
banks will deal with this because you

267
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,279
know it's kind of a pain in the ass for

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
a trading desk to have to manage you

269
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,839
know a thousand different counterparty

270
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,760
relationships each with their own

271
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,440
funding. So usually you'll centralize

272
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,839
that on a central funding desk of some

273
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
sort. They will then assume all of the

274
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
uh

275
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,880
individual traders can fund at a

276
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,399
relatively generic rate and the funding

277
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,959
desk will deal with all these horrible

278
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,399
little uh funding bases uh and small

279
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,399
collateral exposures and things like

280
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,399
that.

281
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,519
Okay, going back a little bit in

282
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
history. Um you may or may not have

283
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,600
heard of Liebore. Uh probably not

284
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,279
because it now is gone. But this was one

285
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,800
of the first really common use rates.

286
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,959
Stands for London interbank offered

287
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,000
rate. Uh it was developed I believe by a

288
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,839
Greek guy in the 60s uh as a method of

289
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,480
standardizing syndicated lending in

290
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,160
London.

291
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
Most bank lending to corporates is

292
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,760
floating rate lending. So you won't you

293
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,040
won't do a fixed rate loan for 10 years.

294
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,399
You'll do a rate that resets every

295
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
month, every three months at the then

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,399
current rate. And the question then was

297
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,640
what rate should we be using to set the

298
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,079
interest payments on these loans at? So

299
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
what he came up with is a notion we're

300
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,600
going to pull the banks as to where they

301
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
lend money shortterm and we'll take the

302
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,880
average of that you know kick out the

303
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,320
highs and lows and then that'll be a

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,399
standard rate everyone can use as a

305
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,079
reference index you know was a very

306
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,399
great very good idea incredibly

307
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,920
successful

308
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
first interest rate swaps which are

309
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,560
really synthetic versions of those came

310
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,480
out in the early 80s uh first swap I

311
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
believe was 1980 or 81 which is a

312
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,279
crosscurrency swap with IBM uh and then

313
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,000
the first pure single currency swap came

314
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,360
out the next here.

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,920
Uh these products had you know

316
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,880
phenomenal growth in the 90s and knots.

317
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,839
Uh currently there's something about 350

318
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,000
or 400 trillion of them outstanding as

319
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,959
of uh labor cessation and still continue

320
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,440
to grow a little more than that. Um so

321
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,560
you know very pro very popular product

322
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,959
very liquid uh very actively traded. You

323
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,399
know, liberate though, you know, again,

324
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,160
another one of the fallouts from the

325
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,399
financial crisis showed that it had some

326
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,399
issues. You know, liber was set by

327
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,600
polling banks. So, you'd go ask the

328
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,040
funding department at each of the big

329
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
banks. I think there's 20 odd people in

330
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,480
the LIBOR pool, were you going to lend

331
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,320
and borrow? Were you going to borrow

332
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
money from they would come up with a

333
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,279
number, they'd quote it. Note that it's

334
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
not based on actual transactions. So,

335
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
they're just making a number up. They're

336
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,519
trying to in theory if they're all good

337
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
players hitting it where they would

338
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,000
actually do the trades. But this is not

339
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,600
actually observable trades and I think

340
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,360
in the sort of late knots early teens um

341
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
group of traders of uh less than

342
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,560
honorable intent realized that this is

343
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,639
and this was a manipulatable rate. Now

344
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,760
you may have for example you know every

345
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
day you're going to look at how much

346
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,079
money you know these rates set every day

347
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,399
and based on your portfolio you'll have

348
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,920
some impact on that. Some of them you

349
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,600
can have millions of dollars a basis

350
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,440
point. A basis point being a hundth of a

351
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
percent. So if you can get that rate up

352
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,959
or down just a little bit uh in your

353
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,279
favor it can end up making you a lot of

354
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
money. So what they did was they

355
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
essentially all you know chatted with

356
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,000
each other and they were chatting with

357
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
whoever the people at their banks were

358
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
responsible for setting these rates and

359
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
convincing them look I need you to make

360
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,639
this a high rate today or I need you to

361
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
make this a lower rate today. Um and

362
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
they could you know you can move this

363
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,120
thing a little bit because it's not

364
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
observable because nothing trades. And

365
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
they, you know, they were doing that for

366
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,360
a while to their advantage. Um, this was

367
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
discovered. Number of them were in jail

368
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,399
for some time. There was very

369
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,399
substantial multi-billion dollar fines

370
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,720
to the banks doing this. But I think the

371
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,839
realization came that this rate didn't

372
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
have any support.

373
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,519
You know, one of the things is Liebore

374
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
is a um, you know, it's an unsecured

375
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,279
rate, if you will. It's it doesn't have

376
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,279
anything backing it like a repo or a

377
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,600
collateral rate. Um, and there's just

378
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,680
not a lot of transactions. Post 2008,

379
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,639
nobody wanted to lend unsecured because

380
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,240
you know you had a number of

381
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,480
bankruptcies. People like Leman's gone

382
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,600
out and you just you don't want to lend

383
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,040
to money who's nothing backing it. So uh

384
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
people weren't happy with that. And you

385
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,480
know some of the things in some of the

386
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
teners and markets I think had you know

387
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
three transactions in a six-month

388
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,600
period. That's not enough but you have

389
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,279
to quote this rate every day. So there's

390
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,720
just nothing fixing it. So that was a

391
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,040
real issue.

392
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
So the Fed set up uh or the Fed plus the

393
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,079
other regulators

394
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,440
uh I guess it came out of London

395
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,279
originally was the big driver for this.

396
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,240
the FSA there um because L being uh

397
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,760
London and Liber

398
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,279
really decided you know you needed a new

399
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,120
rate that was going to be defensible

400
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,160
backing up based on actual transactions

401
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,399
and a number of other criteria to make

402
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
it hard to manipulate so that you know

403
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,519
this would be a genuine real observed

404
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,839
rate and not something that was just

405
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,880
being made up uh by banks to favor their

406
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,760
trading desks.

407
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,360
>> See Andrew just a comment

408
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:31,120
li sound a bit esoteric at this point,

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,760
but at the time uh mortgages mortgage

410
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,959
interest rates were often quoted as

411
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:42,079
LIBOR plus a spread. And my experience

412
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,160
was during the the time of the knots and

413
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,600
the teams, you know, looking at

414
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,360
>> possibly refinancing my mortgage to a

415
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,880
lower rate because rates were coming

416
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,680
down and the lie board did not move much

417
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,839
at all during that period which was

418
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,600
rather frustrating to watch if anyone

419
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
understood why it was not moving. Well,

420
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,680
it was partly that and partly um the

421
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,880
libore to treasury spread which is the

422
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,399
difference between libore rates which

423
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,399
are the the bank rates and the treasury

424
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,120
rates which are government rates uh blew

425
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,800
out in that period around 20112

426
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,199
uh the fine institution I was at at that

427
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,720
point wrote off 8.4 four billion dollars

428
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,959
in structured notes because of that for

429
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,240
example um because they were hedging

430
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,920
their structured notes with LIBOR

431
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
products and assuming the two would stay

432
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,920
together and they just went uh most of

433
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,519
it came back in the next couple years

434
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,040
but it was quite unpleasant for a while

435
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,920
there and and uh made them want to

436
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,959
change how they were doing that. um you

437
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
know when we went through sort of the

438
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,680
liebore retirement you know when you

439
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,279
look at how much of what kind of

440
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,959
products are out there there's all sorts

441
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,240
of weird stuff you know swaps are the

442
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,560
biggest piece but then as you have

443
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,040
floating rate mortgages uh you have a

444
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,199
fair amount of corporate bonds out there

445
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,600
um you have some really bizarre slightly

446
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,880
esoteric stuff that is like you know I

447
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,399
don't know how you redo that when you're

448
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
going to go knock on somebody's door and

449
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,120
tell my mother that you know her library

450
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
plus 100 mortgage is now a sofa plus 150

451
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,720
I don't know what she's going to do with

452
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,720
that other than be confused and call me

453
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,320
and ask for help. I think but um so you

454
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,839
know so they really the labor had to go

455
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,839
because it was it was not not a good

456
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,240
rate anymore. Um and this is also true

457
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,839
of the equivalent libs in at least

458
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,880
Japan, Canada, US, Switzerland, Europe

459
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,240
and uh the UK I think all have uh

460
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,800
replaced their rates with something a

461
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,800
little more uh defensible. In the US,

462
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,519
it's called the sofa rate, which is the

463
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,279
securitized overnight funding rate. Um,

464
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,399
which is essentially the average of

465
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,160
overnight repo trades. So, a repo uh

466
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,839
rate is, you know, if I have a bond, I

467
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,680
can just buy it outright if I want to,

468
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,480
but it's not usually the, you know, an

469
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,639
efficient way to do. I can borrow money

470
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
against the bond. So, if I have I buy

471
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,839
100 million US treasuries, I can then

472
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,519
lend that to somebody, you know, post

473
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,880
that to somebody and borrow say $98

474
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,399
million of cash. He he'll hold my bond.

475
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,000
uh and then if we want we can swap it

476
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,120
back in again but the rate at which

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,040
you're going to pay in that borrowing is

478
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,320
known as the repo rate or reverse repo

479
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,199
rate depending which direction you're

480
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,720
going uh and that's at yeah a real rate

481
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,439
real money changes hands um US has about

482
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,600
800 billion of that a day of the main uh

483
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,520
repo facilities so that's something that

484
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,679
there's a lot of transaction data behind

485
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,919
you can you know look at it measure it

486
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,679
you know add it all up average it uh and

487
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,919
come up with the rate so that's what

488
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,919
they

489
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,679
Um, you know, uh, so far does have some

490
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,439
features that are not so fabulous. You

491
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
know, first of all, it's a daily rate.

492
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
Uh, nobody wants to have a loan where

493
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,840
you have to pay interest every day. It's

494
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
just a pain in the ass operationally and

495
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,960
and not good. You want to pay every

496
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
three months or six months or annually,

497
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,240
for example. That just makes it just

498
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,840
easier mechanically to deal with. Um,

499
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,039
you know, you can compound it into term

500
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,200
rates. So, we'll talk about that in a

501
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,880
slide or two. Uh another thing if you do

502
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,799
compound it into term rates so you do

503
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
like the average so for over threemonth

504
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,080
period and then pay that rate you don't

505
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,120
know the rate until the end of the

506
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,840
period because you haven't finished

507
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,240
doing all your daily uh features. That's

508
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
a bit annoying for uh people because a

509
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,120
lot of people want to know the rate up

510
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,120
front so they can just arrange you know

511
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,480
guess operationally

512
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,640
set all their payment systems make sure

513
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,000
the payments get there schedule that

514
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,240
have enough time to sort out make sure

515
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,919
they're doing the right rate. Uh and the

516
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
other interesting thing is it's sofur is

517
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,200
a secured rate. Banks actually prefer to

518
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,039
lend unsecured. Uh so I think when a

519
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
bank when a bank makes a loan so it'll

520
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,320
do a floating rate lend to a corporate

521
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,679
they'll give them $100 million.

522
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,840
Corporate will pay them the floating

523
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
rate say Libbor plus you know spread or

524
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,000
whatever.

525
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,039
Now if you think about what happens when

526
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,200
um bank credit goes bad. So if there's a

527
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,120
crisis, typically the bank spreads will

528
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,960
blow out, which means LIBOR will blow

529
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,559
out. And if the majority of the income

530
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
is coming from LIBOR products because

531
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,960
that's what you've loaned at, you're now

532
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,600
making more money. So you loan money at

533
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,280
Liber plus 50, LIBOR's now 100, you got

534
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,360
an extra 50 basis points of income

535
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,720
because your credit's deteriorating. So

536
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,919
it's sort of a rightway risk kind of

537
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,760
feature. um that is you know I don't

538
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,120
know if it's worth you know a whole lot

539
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,960
of the bank but it's a nice feature to

540
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,520
have that if bank credit goes bad you

541
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,440
end up making more income so people like

542
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,360
that

543
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,799
said Libbor has mostly been phased out

544
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,679
in the last few years um US ended lieore

545
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,280
last June so June 2023 they're one of

546
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,760
the biggies sterling went earlier um

547
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,000
Canada went two months ago Mexico is

548
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,679
going into this year uh and then there's

549
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
a couple features in yen that are also

550
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,360
happening I think uh early next year.

551
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,200
You know this was an enormous migration

552
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,799
and and uh you know you should hope in

553
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
your careers you never deal with this

554
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,840
kind of stuff because it is just painful

555
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,280
and tedious. Yes.

556
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,799
>> Do you mind introduced lending the

557
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,960
relationship between uh bank credit and

558
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,960
um the funding rate?

559
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,480
>> Okay. So I'm I'm a bank. My my majority

560
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,720
of my corporate lending portfolio is

561
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,720
floating rate loans which are going to

562
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,360
pay me an interest of liber plus a

563
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,799
spread fixed spread. So it it's going to

564
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,320
float. If LIBOR's higher, I make more

565
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,559
money. If LIBO is lower, I make less

566
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,640
money. I'm going to fund myself as

567
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,039
something that's typically not, you

568
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,360
know, less less uh floating than the

569
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,720
rat. So bank credit goes bad. So banks

570
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,799
get into trouble or somebody perceives

571
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,880
that there's a a systematic issue out

572
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,039
there with banking allot 2008 or a

573
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,880
couple other episodes, the liber spreads

574
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,880
are going to increase because, you know,

575
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,960
larger spreads, higher rates, lower

576
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,720
quality generally. So what that means is

577
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,160
the spreads are going to increase. So my

578
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,640
interest I'm going to earn on my loans

579
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,880
has now gone up which helps me because I

580
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
get more income. Make sense? Or

581
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
>> sorry.

582
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,679
>> Okay. Yeah. No, please again please. I'm

583
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,520
talking fast on a big range of topics.

584
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,840
So please jump right in. You're looking

585
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
confused or anything?

586
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,600
No questions?

587
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,880
>> No. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um you know again

588
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,400
you hope in your career you don't have

589
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
to deal with this because it's a pain in

590
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
the ass. It's just an enormous

591
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,240
mechanical process. Uh there's been a

592
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,919
few of them around. Euro conversion was

593
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,440
another one in the late 90s we did where

594
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,640
you know all of the European currencies

595
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,240
converted to euros. Um

596
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,600
yeah I remember sitting in Canary Warf

597
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,880
at that one at like three in the morning

598
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,440
because we'd screwed something up and it

599
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,080
was like oh dear. Um but it all happened

600
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,919
in Y2K is another classic one. There's

601
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,320
been a bunch of other ones like that and

602
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,120
but it all happened and fine. So no more

603
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,799
library.

604
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,240
Okay. So as I mentioned sulfur is a

605
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,159
daily rate. you know, you don't want to

606
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,159
pay daily. So, you know, you can

607
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,799
compound it up. Two standard ways. I'm

608
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,559
going to do daily compounding. So, each

609
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,159
day I'll, you know, work out my discount

610
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,720
factor for that day, which is one plus

611
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,480
the rate over 360. And you just compound

612
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,840
those up. Uh, and then subtract one off

613
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,679
the end, and that'll convert it to an

614
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,240
equivalent term rate. Fine. And you can

615
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,799
pay the term rate. Or I can just do a

616
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,679
simple average. So, just average um the

617
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,520
sofur or average the daily sofers. In

618
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,280
this case, the little d's are the number

619
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,960
of days it applies for. So a rate

620
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,120
setting in Friday will apply for three

621
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,240
days over the weekend. A rate setting in

622
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,880
Monday only applies for one day. Excuse

623
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,200
that. You add it all up, pay that rate.

624
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
Um the majority of products in the

625
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,720
dollar market go on the compounding uh

626
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,159
sofa because it's just it's a simpler

627
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,520
rate to calorie. Uh it also doesn't have

628
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,520
the average and you need to make a

629
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,039
slight correction due to volatility

630
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,440
which is just annoying. You know, it's a

631
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,200
few basis points running so most people

632
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,559
won't care. But um if you're trading

633
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
this a lot as a market maker, you want

634
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,919
to get all this stuff right because the

635
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
bid offers are couple ten of a basis

636
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,960
point. So uh if you have something that

637
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,240
pushes you outside of that, you're going

638
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,240
to lose money.

639
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,039
You know, there's lots of other rates

640
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,320
out there. Uh term sofer is one that CME

641
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,320
created a couple years ago. Uh use they

642
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,600
actually fit something. They have a

643
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,039
little model. They do a best fit to all

644
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,039
the futures prices which are again are

645
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,480
very liquid, well traded stuff. and they

646
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,559
work out one month, three months, six

647
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
month rates and then publish those. It's

648
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,919
a set in advance rate. So I set it now

649
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,080
and it applies for the next three months

650
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,320
say so I'll fix a term so for now pay in

651
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,720
three months at that rate plus whatever.

652
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,200
Uh this one is is quite common in

653
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,080
corporate loans. Uh and again corporate

654
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,840
lending you know um the banks in

655
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
generally have much better systems than

656
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,880
the users. not always the case, but

657
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,559
they've been at this for a while where

658
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,760
if I'm a corporate, I don't necessarily

659
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,400
want to deal with a lot of the

660
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,440
complexities uh and sort of nuances of

661
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,159
this stuff. I just want to have

662
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,520
something fairly simple. Every 3 months,

663
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,720
I'll look a rate up on a screen. I'll

664
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,640
put that on my loan and I'll pay that

665
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,120
three months later. Yep.

666
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,080
I don't know if this is like if I'm not

667
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,960
understanding this correctly, but like

668
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,679
let's assume like we go back to like um

669
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,520
when rates were

670
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,440
kind of now, but like when rates were

671
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,200
there was more of a risk of rates um

672
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,640
going above 6%.

673
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,520
>> That like would directly influence how

674
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,880
like the duration of the the futures

675
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,640
contracts.

676
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,280
>> Is that my

677
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,960
>> sure I'm understanding like the cheapest

678
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,960
deliver for the the futures contract

679
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,280
changes because um like the price at 6%.

680
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,280
>> Sure. So at 6% your futures contract

681
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,120
will hit at 94 because the 100 minus the

682
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,360
price is generally the rate. Fine. Yep.

683
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,520
So then for in terms of thinking about

684
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,480
how in terms of think about how that

685
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,720
affects the term sofur like

686
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,880
theoretically um

687
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,400
>> like that would change the duration of

688
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
the like the cheapest deliver which

689
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,279
means that your term sofer represents a

690
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,760
different rate

691
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,000
>> term so it it is a slightly different

692
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,080
rate. Um,

693
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
so

694
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,400
okay.

695
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,200
So let let me doodle here for a little

696
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,159
bit if you don't mind. Okay. So that's

697
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,240
time that's rate. So what it is, the

698
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
futures will each set a block of say

699
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,039
three-month futures. We'll set an

700
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,960
average over a three-month rate. So I

701
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,520
might have a rate that does that.

702
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Another future that does that and that

703
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,640
might have a little stub period in here

704
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,200
which you know can go back to that

705
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,720
future. So each future will be set and

706
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,679
it's essentially the average over the

707
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,760
term of the future. So what CME then did

708
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,600
was they did a fit of this model to the

709
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,520
futures contracts and they then

710
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
interpolate the daily rate say for six

711
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,279
months which will run from here to about

712
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,039
here.

713
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,640
So they look at that and they'll work

714
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,960
out what the equivalent six-month term

715
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,440
rate is based on

716
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,840
these rates to compute that.

717
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,360
Does that make sense?

718
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,440
Yeah, I think I think I'm not asking

719
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,440
this question. Oh, sorry. I think for a

720
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,440
second.

721
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,240
>> Anyway, so you know, CMA came up with

722
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,080
that. The loan guys like it. Again, you

723
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,600
know, end user corporates don't want to

724
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,279
deal with all the mechanics of daily

725
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,279
sets and operational stuff. It's just a

726
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,919
pain in the ass for them. Um, so they're

727
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,600
happy to let somebody else do that. Um,

728
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,360
you know, it's the usual set in advance,

729
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,000
pay six months or three months from now,

730
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,919
fine. that makes everyone happier. Um

731
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,320
the Fed however doesn't want this to

732
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,600
become a de facto new LIBORE rate. So

733
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,279
they actually have quite severe

734
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,039
restrictions on how much the dealers can

735
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,320
trade in it. Essentially dealers are

736
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,400
only allowed to trade it to hedge their

737
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,600
loan portfolio. Uh which also is an

738
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,520
interesting feature which means it's an

739
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,200
entirely one-way market because you know

740
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,960
banks issue loans. They have to hedge

741
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
it. It's all in the same direction. So

742
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
there's a very substantial basis between

743
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
sort of regular vanilla sofer swaps and

744
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,760
the term sofer swaps. you know,

745
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,919
something around four or five basis

746
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,400
points, which again, in a market context

747
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,919
where that's 20 or 30 times a bid offer,

748
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,279
it's way outside the bid offer range.

749
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,120
Um, there's another sort of older

750
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,039
version of sofur called Fed funds, which

751
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,640
is really average of of slightly

752
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,200
different Fed funds drawing similar to

753
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,039
sofur at still in wide use. And there's

754
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,520
a whole lot of other crazy rates, prime,

755
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,760
disco, you know, municipal or military

756
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,679
housing rates and all sorts of other

757
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,960
stuff. Disco is my favorite rate. Not

758
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,279
for any reason other than I like the

759
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,279
name but which is a Fanny made discount

760
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,279
rate.

761
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,039
Okay.

762
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,320
Okay. So now discounting rates. One of

763
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,760
the questions is how do you work out

764
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,200
what the discounting rate is going to

765
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,279
be? For example, what rate should you

766
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,039
use to discount you know a future

767
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,400
payment?

768
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,320
So let's assume we have you know a

769
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,880
simple case of a fixed payment f for

770
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,400
fixed at a time t. We're assume some

771
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,919
discounting rate and we'll value the

772
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,360
payment today. give a present value of

773
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,600
P. Now we have to fund this rate. So we

774
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,440
have you know we generally in in this

775
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,799
world you assume that you are not just

776
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,480
you know spending money out of your back

777
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,760
pocket. You're going to go borrow money

778
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,919
from somewhere and use it to purchase

779
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,279
this thing. So we'll buy P and we're

780
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,880
going to buy at whatever our funding

781
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,200
rate is. So whatever we can borrow money

782
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,960
at that's what we will do to fund it.

783
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,039
And now just think a little bit about

784
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,600
from one day to the next day. What are

785
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,919
the cash flows involved here? You have

786
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
two of them essentially. you have you're

787
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,760
going to have to pay money to borrow in

788
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,360
your you will have to pay interest on

789
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,640
your borrowing. So whatever interest

790
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
rate you've done for one day you're

791
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,400
going to pay that and then your

792
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,919
underlying asset which is the fixed cash

793
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,120
flow in the future will increase in

794
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,400
value a little bit because you're

795
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,400
getting one day closer to its payment.

796
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,720
Okay. So the interest paid you know the

797
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,880
interest is just going to be whatever

798
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,840
the present value of that is be it t not

799
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,960
times the borrowing rate um over 360. So

800
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,520
that's how much you're paying to fund

801
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,600
this. And the increase in value, it's

802
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,840
going to go up by yesterday's value

803
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,360
times 1 plus r over 360. That's sort of

804
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,919
the the compounded rate occurral factor

805
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,039
or the change in that is you know again

806
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,480
the uh value times r over 360. Notice

807
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,279
that the first and the third equation

808
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,919
have very similar forms here. The only

809
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,520
thing different are the two rates.

810
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,120
So this is actually going to imply those

811
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,039
rates have to be the same or there's an

812
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,720
arbitrage here.

813
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,480
So that means that your discounting rate

814
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,240
that you should be using to discount un

815
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
you know future cash flows is whatever

816
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,360
your funding rate is. So whatever you

817
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,960
can borrow money at that's the

818
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,200
appropriate rate to discount future

819
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
flows at.

820
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,840
Now if those rates are different you

821
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,440
know there's a trade. You can either

822
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,799
borrow cheaper than you can invest or

823
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,399
you can invest cheaper than you can

824
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,960
borrow and you do one or the other and

825
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,960
that'll come back.

826
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,120
This actually this is a very you know if

827
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,399
you only pick one thing away from the

828
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,159
hour and a half we're spending here

829
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,600
remember this because this is you know

830
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,600
funding and discounting are the same.

831
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,159
Okay let's talk a little bit about some

832
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,240
of the products just going to talk about

833
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,840
the vanilla ones. So the question is how

834
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,520
do I compute what I think um forward

835
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,679
rates should be and what projections of

836
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,960
those should be. So what I'm going to do

837
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,960
essentially is build a curve uh to do

838
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,320
that I'm going to start with by thinking

839
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,000
what are the easily observable

840
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,600
instruments in the market. What can I

841
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,760
see out there that I can think I you

842
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,880
know whatever my pricing uh model is

843
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,720
going to be these are the things it

844
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,120
needs to hit because I can trade these

845
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,399
things.

846
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,080
Some of the common ones we're talking

847
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,399
about are CDs which are certificate of

848
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,240
deposits. These are very short-term uh

849
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,840
bank lending borrowing. You know, you

850
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
can walk into a bank and buy a one-mon

851
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,919
CD at four and a half% if you want.

852
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,520
Maybe a three-month one, six-month one.

853
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,840
Doesn't go much beyond that. Maybe a

854
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,919
year, you know, again, fairly liquid,

855
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,559
quite common. Interest rate futures,

856
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,679
very liquid products, uh, can do that.

857
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,880
And finally, interest rate swaps.

858
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,039
Now, so for each of these, we're going

859
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,640
to work out what is the price of this as

860
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,480
a function of my discounting curve. So,

861
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,919
and then given that the cash rates, I

862
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,520
can invert that to find what my

863
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,120
discounting implied curve is. that

864
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,600
prices all these instruments back to

865
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,320
market.

866
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,880
So CDs, you know, nothing too hard here.

867
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,880
You know, I buy a CD, I get the amount I

868
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,360
invested plus the rate accured over the

869
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
time. The value of that is that forward

870
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,039
uh interest amount plus the forward

871
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,640
return of my principal discounted back

872
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,720
or inverted. I just get, you know, Z is

873
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,760
one over one plus R delta T. That's

874
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,880
again, that's a thing you're going to

875
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,720
see all over the place.

876
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,320
These rates are well observable. They're

877
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,320
a little little bit tricky because a

878
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,000
swaps test typically can't necessarily

879
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,640
trade them because these CDs are funded

880
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,799
products. I have to actually, you know,

881
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,799
buy them. I want a 100 million CD. I

882
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,159
need to give somebody $100 million. I

883
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,279
have to get that. Swap desks don't like

884
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,200
that. They, you know, they prefer

885
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,559
derivative instruments which are not

886
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,559
unfunded instruments because you just

887
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,000
have to put less cash up front and

888
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,120
everybody likes less cash up front

889
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,360
because it means you can do more,

890
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,679
leverage yourself up more, uh, and so

891
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,200
on.

892
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,960
Okay. Second one is interest rate

893
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,679
futures. Uh again, very liquid

894
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,320
contracts. Uh US ones trade on the CME

895
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,080
exchange in Chicago. Uh every country

896
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,320
generally has, you know, a relatively

897
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,159
active short-term rate. Canada trades on

898
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,919
Montreal. Um the UK contracts trade on,

899
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,919
I believe, the LME. The Euro contracts

900
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,760
trade on the Euroex. Japan contracts

901
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,760
trade on um Tokyo, I think, stock

902
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,760
exchange.

903
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,120
So, um two main contractors, a one-month

904
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,480
contracts and a three-month contracts.

905
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,480
They're slightly different, which is a

906
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,240
bit annoying. Three-month contract

907
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,080
trades on a compounded rate. One-month

908
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,919
contract trades uh on a average rate.

909
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,120
Three-month contract goes from ImMate to

910
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,200
Imm. IMM is international monetary

911
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,720
market, which was an old market in

912
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,440
Chicago that sort of set the standards

913
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,840
here, which is the third weddednesday of

914
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,399
every March, June, September, December.

915
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,320
Uh it's just when the contracts settle

916
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,080
and that's fine. The one month contracts

917
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,760
trade on a calendar month. So today's

918
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,240
contract started in September 1st, we'll

919
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,360
settle on October 1st. I think maybe off

920
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,159
by a day there. The futures settle at

921
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,000
100 minus uh the rate. So you know, if I

922
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
have a interest rate of 5% when I'm

923
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,360
settling a future, that'll be a 95

924
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,799
price. And so and again,

925
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,799
people just did it that way because they

926
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,880
like to know markets rallying, contracts

927
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,519
go up, markets selling off, contracts go

928
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,679
down. For bonds, price and yield move in

929
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,840
opposite directions. So yields go up,

930
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,000
prices go down and so on. So that's why

931
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,600
they set the uh 100 minus that line.

932
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,360
There's a small convexity adjustment

933
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,440
here as well dealing with futures

934
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,720
margining and I'm going to just wave my

935
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,960
hands and gloss over, but it's something

936
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,039
you have to be conscious of. Uh futures

937
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,200
do daily margining. It's a standard part

938
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,880
of a futures contract. So if I have an

939
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,279
interest rate futures contract and I you

940
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,039
know I enter in into it and generally

941
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,200
you'll enter into a futures contract at

942
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,760
no upfront cost aside from some initial

943
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,240
margin perhaps market moves up you know

944
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,399
futures contract goes from 90 to 91

945
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,640
they'll give me one back in margin if it

946
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,799
goes from 90 to 89 I have to pay one to

947
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,039
remar it so at the end of every day you

948
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,720
settle up the net move on that day and

949
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,240
they do this to sort of minimize credit

950
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,559
exposure between that but if I think if

951
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,320
I have an interest rate contract you

952
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,640
When the price of the contract goes up,

953
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,240
I'm getting money back. But the the fact

954
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,240
that the price went up implies rates

955
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,000
have gone down. So that means I can

956
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,480
reinvest my money and now at a lower

957
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,559
rate or if the contract goes down in

958
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,159
value, uh I have to fund that more

959
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,080
because I need to anti up more margin to

960
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,159
the exchange, but I'm having to do that

961
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,720
at a higher interest rate. So this sort

962
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,240
of correlation between the uh flows of

963
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,640
money and what it's going to cost me to

964
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,360
borrow or lend that introduces a small

965
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,360
uh valuation impact.

966
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,200
Okay, so let's talk about interest rate

967
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,919
swaps, which are probably the biggest

968
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,000
single uh product on the planet. Uh this

969
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,760
is basically an agreement, a custom

970
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,880
agreement between two counterparties to

971
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,679
exchange two sets of cash flows. In the

972
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,000
most uh simple case, one of these is a

973
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,679
fixed rate. So I'm going to pay you 5% a

974
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,159
year for 10 years. And the other one is

975
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,879
a floating rate. I'm going to pay you in

976
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,560
um compounded so far. I'll pay you

977
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,720
annually every 10 years. We'll do that

978
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,440
for 10 years. Uh and then we'll call it

979
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,800
a day. Uh there many many variations of

980
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,560
these structures. There's all sorts of

981
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,159
crazy stuff and you you know imagination

982
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
is the limit here. As long as you convin

983
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,599
somebody else to do the other side of

984
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,440
it. They're a tremendously useful

985
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,960
instrument. Um they're great if you know

986
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,280
if I need to hedge something or change

987
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,280
my risk profile. It's a very efficient

988
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
way to do it. These are all derivative

989
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,040
products means they generally don't use

990
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,960
balance sheet. They don't take a lot of

991
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,359
upfront capital. They're cheap to fund.

992
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,960
So they're quite popular uh for those

993
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,280
reasons

994
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,960
and I said they are the most liquid uh

995
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,320
interest rate product out there.

996
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,919
They're one of these things that you

997
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,800
know there's a lot of mechanics to get

998
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,480
it right. Um in particular you know if

999
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
you if you enter you know you work in

1000
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,599
this field you will get very good at

1001
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,079
data arithmetic which is sort of a

1002
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,520
stupid thing but um I mean I remember

1003
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
once I was interviewing a guy and he

1004
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,040
just done a PhD in numerical methods I

1005
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,480
think and one of the questions he asked

1006
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,599
me which was a great question so you

1007
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,200
know keep this in mind when you're

1008
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,119
interviewing he said if I come and work

1009
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,960
for you a year from now what will I know

1010
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,359
now what will I know then that I don't

1011
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,359
know now and I said you will know how to

1012
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,160
do data arithmetic he looked at me kind

1013
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,520
of funny but went away and they actually

1014
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,359
gave a job and he took it and he's

1015
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,560
fabulous guy and he came back a year

1016
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,800
from now and said you know you were

1017
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,640
right you know I know how to tell you

1018
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,240
know between my birthday and today how

1019
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,160
many days are there it's not a unique

1020
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,480
answer to that one by the way just to

1021
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,480
make it come depends on your conventions

1022
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,200
um and I'm also going to guess in

1023
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
interest rate swaps at least 90% of all

1024
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,560
problems are date related that's the

1025
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,320
first thing you want to look at do I

1026
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,720
have the dates correct because you know

1027
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,160
am I using the right holiday calendars

1028
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,119
uh and holiday calendars again it's

1029
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,880
another one of these things that's

1030
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,119
occasionally annoying you They're they

1031
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,880
change. We had Junth added a couple

1032
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,880
years ago, for example. We had the

1033
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,400
Queen's funeral added. Every time a

1034
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,160
president or ex-president dies, there's

1035
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,920
a holiday and just these, you know,

1036
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,400
Canada had truth and reconciliation day

1037
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,920
added recently. So, you know, you have

1038
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
to make sure you build your models to

1039
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,839
account for, you know, the fact that

1040
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,200
holidays may be dynamic. So, I just put

1041
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,960
on there a simple sort of standard

1042
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,400
dollar swap roll out and you there's a

1043
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
half dozen different steps to actually

1044
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,440
get what are the acral periods and the

1045
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,200
cash flows and the payment dates and the

1046
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,359
reset dates. You know, you start with

1047
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,359
today, you go to the trade date. It's a

1048
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,800
forward starting date. From that, you

1049
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,640
typically add two days. You go to the

1050
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,000
effective date. You then add the tenor

1051
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,240
of the swap to get the maturity date,

1052
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,160
unjusted maturity date. You then roll

1053
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,400
that back in increments of the payment

1054
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,839
frequency. Get the unadjusted roll

1055
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,359
dates. And then you adjust everything

1056
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,880
based on a holiday calendar, which

1057
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,640
typically be New York banking or

1058
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,720
something.

1059
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,800
Um, and again, you got to be really

1060
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,640
precise on the calendars. Another one of

1061
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,440
the questions I like to ask people is

1062
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,200
how many distinct dollar calendars do

1063
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,880
you think exist in terms of swaps

1064
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,960
monitor which is a standard source for

1065
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,800
all calendar data. How many dollar

1066
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,280
calendars do you think they have? Any

1067
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,280
want to take a guess?

1068
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,880
So I have New York banking for example.

1069
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,359
I might have New York Fed. I might have

1070
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,359
somebody guess

1071
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,440
no penalties for getting it wrong.

1072
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,920
Okay, Peter, what's your guess? You've

1073
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,720
been around for longer.

1074
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,160
>> Let's see. Um,

1075
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,520
I would guess maybe 150.

1076
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,760
>> You're in the right ballpark. Last time

1077
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,720
I checked, there was 294.

1078
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,240
And they're all, you know, every

1079
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,680
exchange has got its own calendar and

1080
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,359
they're all different. Every major

1081
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,480
business center has its own calendar.

1082
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,680
And it's just, you know, if you get the

1083
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,880
wrong calendar, you're going to price

1084
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,280
stuff on the wrong date and you're going

1085
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,119
to mispric things. Uh, and then winner's

1086
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,880
curse rule says if you price something

1087
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,040
wrong, you only get the trade when it

1088
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,920
hurts you. So, um, and again, dates are

1089
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,359
just an enormous pain.

1090
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,040
Okay, value of the swap, we're going to

1091
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,240
do it in two pieces. We'll start with,

1092
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,839
um, the fixed side. So, fixed side is

1093
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,520
relative forward. We roll out all the

1094
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,520
cash flows. We work out how much we're

1095
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,680
paying on what dates we're paying. We

1096
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,400
then, you know, from our curve, get the

1097
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,079
uh, uh, discount factors there. Sum it

1098
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,000
all up. So in this case I've just got C

1099
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,160
which is the coupon rate. Delta is the

1100
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,880
acrual fraction. So if it's an annual

1101
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,720
swap that'll be our round one notional

1102
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,880
and then times the discount factor. Sum

1103
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,920
it up. That's a present value of the

1104
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,240
fixed side.

1105
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,200
Floating side's a little harder but same

1106
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,200
idea but instead of the um coupon rate

1107
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
I've got the forward rates uh which are

1108
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,000
little F. So I have to work out what the

1109
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,480
forward rates are but you know we'll get

1110
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,440
to that in the next slide. uh you know

1111
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,200
some mechanics are about what is the u

1112
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,880
what are the particular specifications

1113
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,760
is it set at the beginning at the end is

1114
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,280
it forward maybe a spread in there but

1115
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,520
you end up with there sort of two

1116
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,119
different uh curves you here I need one

1117
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,480
curve to generate the forward rates from

1118
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,800
and another curve to generate the

1119
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,480
discounting factors from in the vanilla

1120
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,280
swap those are both the sofur curve so

1121
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,000
they're actually only one curve okay so

1122
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,000
what do you want to do here

1123
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,839
there's another bit of magic here that I

1124
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,320
can actually generate an employee

1125
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,920
floating rate from fixed flows only. So

1126
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,720
if I assume I can borrow fixed rate

1127
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,720
bonds, I can borrow one at a given at a

1128
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,720
first date, invest it and pay it back at

1129
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,440
a later date, invest it at the unknown

1130
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,520
floating rate and then pay it back at

1131
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,200
the end. Uh and I'm assume I'm going to

1132
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,760
invest at a rate that's a fair trade. So

1133
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,040
PV of that is zero. So I end up here

1134
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,800
with, you know, the initial term there

1135
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,520
is me borrowing the money. I have time

1136
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,119
t0 me getting the interest rate at time

1137
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,839
one and me getting the principal back at

1138
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,440
time one. So given all that sums to zero

1139
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,280
I can work out what the implied forward

1140
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,520
rates from this discounting curve are.

1141
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,160
So I use that plug it through the swaps

1142
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,839
uh and now I've got a uh swap market. So

1143
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,280
for an implied swap markets you know

1144
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,280
generally when you do a swap it's

1145
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,920
usually done at a zero PV or something

1146
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,280
pretty close to a zero PV. So when I

1147
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,880
look at the two legs and sum them up,

1148
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm making zero. I've got, you know, the

1149
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,320
fixed side plus the float side. You

1150
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,560
know, both just the sum of the fixed

1151
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,920
rates times the discounting factors. Uh

1152
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,079
and then, you know, subtracting the

1153
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,320
float side giving factors, do some

1154
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,240
arithmetic, and I get the uh what the

1155
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,920
implied swap rate coupon is.

1156
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,200
Now, this is useful because swap rates

1157
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,880
are observed. I go to my favorite

1158
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,640
Bloomberg screen, I can see all sorts of

1159
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,640
swap rates. So that's what I have to

1160
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,920
work out my zero curve to fit those.

1161
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,839
Any questions? I feel like I'm just

1162
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,320
motoring through this here right now.

1163
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,960
So, yep.

1164
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,680
>> Can we get these these slides? This is a

1165
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,560
question. This is a question.

1166
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,839
>> Sorry. What was the question?

1167
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,160
>> I was going to ask if we'd get the

1168
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,599
slides. I don't know if they posted.

1169
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,680
>> I can certainly send them. I don't think

1170
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,920
I have them, but

1171
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,079
>> we don't have them.

1172
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,079
>> There is there is nothing too top secret

1173
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:59,359
in any of this. Um that's how you do.

1174
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:03,040
>> See Andrew, one comment. Um I'm not a

1175
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,960
fixed income expert, but um the zero

1176
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,160
sort of present value at trade

1177
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,240
initiation is quite an important uh

1178
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,040
feature I think where it um encourages

1179
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:19,200
people interested in either side of the

1180
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,040
swap to be comfortable with uh making

1181
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,720
the trade. Yeah, that's sort of the

1182
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,960
so-called par rate, which is the rate

1183
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,079
that prices it at par, aka for a swap,

1184
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,359
that's zero. Um, you could price it at

1185
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,960
something other than that. And, you

1186
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,800
know, again, bid offers in this market

1187
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,079
are usually a tenth of a basis point,

1188
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,319
two ten of the basis point. So, it's

1189
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,920
around zero. Um, you know, some of the

1190
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,920
structured transactions will have swaps

1191
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
that are way off market and then, you

1192
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,160
know, that may get accounted for

1193
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,720
elsewhere or that just may be where

1194
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,680
you're taking your P&L out of.

1195
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,680
Just another comment that the a long

1196
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,960
time ago, this is like the late 80s, um

1197
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,000
I was at the Sloan School and uh swaps

1198
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,560
were becoming very popular. And one of

1199
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,440
the reasons they were becoming very

1200
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,160
popular was that certain corporations

1201
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:11,280
could access sort of fixed rates at very

1202
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:15,040
low rates and less uh creditw worthy

1203
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:18,000
companies could not have access to such

1204
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,560
good rates for borrowing but did have

1205
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,200
access to floating rates and so these

1206
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,160
corporations would sort of pair up uh

1207
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,760
with a swap. I don't know to what extent

1208
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,240
the swap market now is

1209
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,920
>> it's I think it's well past that but

1210
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,480
>> but at the time if I'm a lower rated guy

1211
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,160
and I can maybe borrow short term but

1212
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,520
nobody's going to l lend me money long

1213
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,119
term because they don't trust you know

1214
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,240
I'll be around in 20 years but maybe

1215
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,079
they're they're comfortable that I'll be

1216
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,599
here in three months and have another

1217
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,680
guy who can then fund for 20 years

1218
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,040
because he's a high credit rating. We

1219
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,880
can both bore in respective countries

1220
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,480
then do a swap. So I now have fixed rate

1221
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,680
swaps and he has floating rate swaps and

1222
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,119
depending how they want to manage their

1223
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,160
treasuries that may be a great trade for

1224
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,440
all sides. So yeah, again swaps are very

1225
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,520
flexible. They let you move the risk

1226
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,960
around in quite a flexible way and quite

1227
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,880
a customizable way.

1228
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,560
Okay. So let's talk now about the core

1229
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,079
sort of uh valuation model really in uh

1230
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,920
interest rate swaps which is the yield

1231
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,280
curve. So we're going to parameterize

1232
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,200
the yield curve. And a yield curve is

1233
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,640
used to it's just to get a function of

1234
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,920
the discounting as a function of time

1235
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,000
which then feeds all of the other

1236
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,000
valuation models. So, we're going to

1237
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,280
parameterize it by a set of times and

1238
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,640
zero uh zero coupon bond prices. You can

1239
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,440
parameterize it in a number of different

1240
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,520
ways, but this is one of the easy ones.

1241
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,839
I also need to choose a method to figure

1242
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,319
out what is my uh zero um disease if I'm

1243
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,760
in between not points. So, maybe I have

1244
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,839
annual knot points. So, I'll do a 1,

1245
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,520
two, three, four, five up to 10 years

1246
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,040
for my times and I'll have disease at

1247
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,119
each of that. But suppose I need a four

1248
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,440
and a half year discount factor. How do

1249
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,839
I do that? lots of p lots of

1250
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,040
possibilities here. Um first of all I'll

1251
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,359
talk about in the not points you know

1252
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,079
how do you choose which times to use to

1253
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,280
your interpolate that simplest one which

1254
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,480
is the most common one is you just use

1255
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,480
the maturity dates of all your

1256
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,400
instruments so I'm going to build it

1257
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,960
with say one two three you know five

1258
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,560
seven 10 years swaps I have not points 1

1259
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,560
2 3 5 7 10 years use that that's easy

1260
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,480
one uh there's other possibilities like

1261
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,200
FOMC dates which we'll talk about in a

1262
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,760
minute um you also have to be a little

1263
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,520
careful on picking your knot points to

1264
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,599
work well with your interpolation method

1265
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,359
because some of them there's some you

1266
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,480
can make bad choices here which will

1267
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:30,079
give you unstable hedging.

1268
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,960
We then are going to fit a set of market

1269
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,200
observables here to get the Z's. So

1270
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,760
given that we've chosen an interpolation

1271
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,160
on knots, you know, we have hopefully n

1272
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,480
knots and n points we can solve. Let's

1273
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,800
talk a little bit about CDF spline. This

1274
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,319
is a constant daily forwards. This is

1275
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,839
one of the easy ones which you assume

1276
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,760
that between your knot points your daily

1277
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,119
forward rates are constant. So you end

1278
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,359
up with a curve that looks like sort of

1279
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,760
a skyline or a stair step or something.

1280
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,440
Just an example there simple one where

1281
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,760
you know in this case you can see what

1282
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,400
my uh not points are. I think I have six

1283
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,440
months a year uh two years, three years,

1284
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,359
5 years, 7, 10 and 20 I believe and 30

1285
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,319
and the forward rates are just flat in

1286
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:13,920
between them. This perfectly good this

1287
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,680
is really fast. Um this is a local

1288
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,079
interpolation method which is one of the

1289
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,400
key features. And what I mean by that is

1290
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:23,040
if I'm looking at you know I want to

1291
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,119
find a discount factor say there it only

1292
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,480
depends on the value there and the value

1293
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,160
there. It doesn't depend on anything

1294
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,839
here or anything there. So I'm just

1295
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,079
going to interpolate between those two.

1296
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:34,079
>> Why do you not choose the not purity

1297
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,960
based on minimizing error?

1298
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,560
>> No on what?

1299
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,960
>> On minimizing error.

1300
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,359
>> How are you going to do that?

1301
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,920
>> Like chubby chef.

1302
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,440
you could um what you want to do the

1303
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,640
thing in on the simple case is you want

1304
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,680
to maintain a connection between your

1305
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,440
not point and your calibration

1306
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,359
instruments. So in this case I'm

1307
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,200
choosing be maturities. You can do lots

1308
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,000
of other stuff but you could for example

1309
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,640
let's suppose you had this set of uh not

1310
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,200
instruments to the not points here you

1311
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,839
know if I choose uh say not points at 5

1312
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,920
10 15 20 25 30 I'm oversp specified here

1313
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,280
and I'm underspecified there. So you

1314
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,760
need to choose it with regards to how

1315
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,119
you're going to calibrate u particularly

1316
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,880
uh and the other thing that comes out is

1317
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,880
when I work out the simplest cases what

1318
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,800
my hedges are. It's in terms of my yield

1319
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,640
curve input instruments. So I want to

1320
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
choose a good set of liquid observable

1321
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,119
stuff that I can actually transact in to

1322
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,880
do the hedging. There's a zillion ways

1323
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,560
to do this and that's still you know 30

1324
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,079
years in that's still a very active area

1325
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,680
of research and discussion. So um lots

1326
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,240
of stuff and and you know some of the

1327
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,839
areas like some of the um uh computer

1328
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,760
graphics for example has a lot of

1329
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,359
advanced interpolation stuff you know

1330
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,240
beastplines and beyond and all of those

1331
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:46,040
are likely entirely uh relevant here

1332
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,040
just haven't looked at it

1333
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,400
anyway so this one gets you your very

1334
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,599
characteristic shape so this is you know

1335
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:58,079
probably the least smooth simplest fast

1336
00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:00,160
method so it's got popularities for that

1337
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,319
on the other side the most smooth little

1338
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,760
slower cubic splines. So in this case

1339
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,640
I'm just going to fit a peiewise cubic

1340
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,480
polomial here. So I'll work out all what

1341
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,400
my little parameters are and then I'm

1342
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,000
just going to you know sum it up. I have

1343
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,760
four terms you know cubic in each

1344
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,520
interval. I impose constraints at the

1345
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,920
edge of the intervals on continuity and

1346
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,079
smoothness and do that. Again this is

1347
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,040
still a reasonably fast method is a very

1348
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,200
smooth curve. Now this curve is not

1349
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,960
local. This is a global curve and you

1350
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,400
know if any of you go into interest rate

1351
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,680
quant space you need to make up little

1352
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,720
laminated cards saying I can have fast

1353
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,400
local hedges or I can have smooth global

1354
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,680
hedges and it can be anywhere in

1355
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,000
between. But you know I've had this

1356
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,440
argument for 30 years with traders. Um

1357
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,640
traders always want you know if I'm

1358
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,079
going to do a hedge of eightear

1359
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,920
instrument they want it to be only seven

1360
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,359
and 10 year hedges. They don't like it

1361
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,119
when the hedges sort of spill over to

1362
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:54,240
five years or 15 years. But you know

1363
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,319
smoothness is a global property. So if

1364
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,000
this is my curve and I'm you know I have

1365
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:01,200
a point you know somewhere instrument in

1366
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,400
this area and I'm um you know pricing it

1367
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,319
you know it's affected obviously by

1368
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,000
these two but if this point here was

1369
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,839
down here I would have a different shape

1370
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,480
through that area because I'm

1371
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,240
maintaining smoothness again global so

1372
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,800
what the global thing implies is that

1373
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,680
I'm sensitive to points much farther out

1374
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,079
from my maturity point and again this is

1375
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,720
an argument you know we've had for

1376
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,400
decades um some of the smooth methods

1377
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,960
are better than others. Cubic spine is

1378
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,160
probably the worst um because it is the

1379
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,599
most smooth. I guess you could do a

1380
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,920
quintic spine or something if you really

1381
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,680
wanted to be uh sort of pathologic, but

1382
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,000
uh that would be a weird thing to do.

1383
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,920
Okay, so then how do I calibrate? You

1384
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,359
know, I can write my error function. I'm

1385
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,240
going to price each instrument as a

1386
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,359
function of my my uh proposed curve. I'm

1387
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,559
going to, you know, from that take the

1388
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,800
difference between that and what the

1389
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,760
actual observed price is.

1390
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,200
So if I can then just if I have uh you

1391
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,040
know n knots and n calibration

1392
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,359
instrument I just solve that exactly you

1393
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,359
know pick your favorite numerical solver

1394
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:02,160
and off you go or in some cases you can

1395
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,000
actually bootstrap it and be fast or if

1396
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,040
I want to relax that constraint that I

1397
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,559
have to have the same number of

1398
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,359
calibration instruments as points. Maybe

1399
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,440
I'm going to do a le squares fit. I can

1400
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:15,119
just pick my favorite minimizer and uh

1401
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,800
let it go and see what we come up with.

1402
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,480
Now you can also include lots of other

1403
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,359
stuff in your objective function other

1404
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,119
than just the errors. So you know one of

1405
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,880
the stuff we built with for example are

1406
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,119
I want smoothness constraints. So I'm

1407
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,240
going to underspecify a curve but then

1408
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,680
I'm going to impose additional

1409
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,160
smoothness constraints because I want my

1410
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,880
curve to be smooth. That's fine. Uh I

1411
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,640
can also drop the exact fit uh

1412
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,319
requirement a little bit. You know there

1413
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,240
is no single price on it. There's always

1414
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,839
a bid offer. So maybe I'm happy with my

1415
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,839
curve prices things to within a bid

1416
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:47,440
offer. That's close enough. I can't

1417
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:49,119
distinguish that from an exact fit and

1418
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,000
any a number of other uh extra

1419
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,000
constraints you can add here.

1420
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,880
Okay. Now just one of the other ones and

1421
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,520
actually you know when we take a look at

1422
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,839
rates so this is uh sofer rates over the

1423
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,319
last I think three or four years. This

1424
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:07,119
doesn't look very smooth. All right.

1425
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:09,760
This in fact looks very stairsteppy. And

1426
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,200
what you'll notice here is the rates are

1427
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,119
this is a little this is an interesting

1428
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,480
spike cause for tax uh receipt issues

1429
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,000
which caused a lot of concernation in

1430
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,079
the industry at the time but we'll

1431
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,680
ignore that for now. Um you know it's

1432
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,359
generally flat and then it goes up. It

1433
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,800
stays flat. It goes up. These are the

1434
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,720
central bank meeting dates. So these are

1435
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,040
when the FOMC gets together and decides

1436
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,040
we're increasing rates. The rate the

1437
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,559
daily rates will generally stay constant

1438
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,480
until the next FOMC rate change. Um, you

1439
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,640
can tell this graph actually needs a 50

1440
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,000
basis point drop off of the right side

1441
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,800
of that because they just cut rates last

1442
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,720
week. Um, so this is this looks very

1443
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,880
sort of like the CDF function for

1444
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,480
example. So there's another curve model

1445
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,319
that I think is probably pretty much uh

1446
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,160
pretty widely used at this point in the

1447
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,960
industry which is I'm going to build my

1448
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,480
not points um based on the central bank

1449
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,079
meeting dates because those are the only

1450
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,160
dates that rates are going to change in

1451
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,160
general or going to change materially

1452
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,680
and I'll assume it's flat in between.

1453
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,680
Uh so that's one again I think that

1454
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,040
started six or seven years ago and it's

1455
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,680
pretty far as I know almost everybody

1456
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,119
uses this methodology now where you have

1457
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,200
generally the central bank will publish

1458
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,720
the next two years meeting calendar if

1459
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,240
you really want to you can apply beyond

1460
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,280
that but two years is about the stuff

1461
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,800
you know uh and then we'll assume say a

1462
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,559
spline beyond that um you end up with a

1463
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,920
little bit of issues on how do you

1464
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,760
choose your instruments there's eight

1465
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,000
meeting dates eight central bank meeting

1466
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,599
dates a year four quarterly futures a

1467
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,040
year so you have a slight under

1468
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,680
constraint raint issue here. So you need

1469
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,240
to fill that in somehow. You can include

1470
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,000
the one year sorry one month futures

1471
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,920
smoothness constraint. You have to do

1472
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,480
something else but that's fine. Um also

1473
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,640
recently in the last couple years um

1474
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,880
actual swaps between meeting dates have

1475
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,960
started to trade. So basically this is a

1476
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,640
bet on the implied rate you know after

1477
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,800
this meeting date. So if you think the

1478
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,839
Fed is going to cut it the next uh

1479
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,920
meeting, which I think is early

1480
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,599
November, you can buy a swap from

1481
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,280
November through I think middle or late

1482
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,720
December at this rate. And that's

1483
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,640
essentially the implied rate after the

1484
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,839
meeting. So I don't know what they're

1485
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,240
think probably thinking is they're going

1486
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,680
to drop 25 basis points. Fine. They

1487
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,440
surprise people a little bit by dropping

1488
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,640
50. Fine. But there's there's

1489
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,880
instruments that will directly uh uh

1490
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,880
probe that and reflect that rate. So

1491
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:27,119
that's also something you can do.

1492
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,079
Okay. Um, yep. So I said we can make a

1493
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,599
hybrid curve and this works pretty well.

1494
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,440
Lots of other stuff in curves and this

1495
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,319
is still

1496
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,680
very active area of research. There's

1497
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,319
other features that you sometimes want

1498
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,680
to account to. For example, turns um

1499
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,760
there's an interesting feature where

1500
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,079
there's dates that are significant

1501
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,440
accounting dates year ends. For example,

1502
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,599
generally corporates will post their

1503
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,079
earnings and their balance sheets return

1504
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,480
in assets on December 31st or you know

1505
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,319
quarterly. So what that does is puts a

1506
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,160
premium to borrow money over that rate.

1507
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,680
If I'm a bank, I want to minimize my

1508
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,400
balance sheet when I'm reporting what it

1509
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,760
is because I'm going to be judged uh by

1510
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,079
the investor community and things like

1511
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,839
return on assets on total assets and

1512
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,240
things like that. So I don't want my

1513
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:12,000
assets to spike over year end. On the

1514
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,520
other hand, money is money and if

1515
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,119
somebody wants to borrow money over year

1516
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,319
end for some other reason, I'll do it.

1517
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,839
But I'm going to charge them a premium

1518
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:22,240
for that.

1519
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:24,160
So you find the curves actually

1520
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,480
you know if I actually look at a curve

1521
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,960
it might be like but then I'll have a

1522
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,760
big spike you know every year so maybe

1523
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,000
that's one year where this essentially

1524
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,240
is the premium for borrowing over year

1525
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,599
end so those you can include in curves

1526
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,119
as well and you'll find um some of the

1527
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,280
hedge funds in particular are slightly

1528
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,839
nasty. So they'll do a trade where they

1529
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,520
want to do one swap to this date and the

1530
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:50,240
second swap opposite direction to that

1531
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,000
date. So they're really just picking out

1532
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,000
uh whatever you know curve building

1533
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,599
you're doing over year end and you know

1534
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
it's very easy to get that wrong and you

1535
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,160
know you do it enough size and it's real

1536
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,720
money.

1537
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,079
So and the other way there al also other

1538
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,559
sort of approaches you can do for

1539
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,240
example do a PCA method you know one of

1540
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,160
the things on the curve is I may build a

1541
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,800
curve typically it's about 50 inputs for

1542
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,960
a dollar curve you know there's widely

1543
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,160
varying liquidity among all those 50

1544
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,680
typically there's going to be about a

1545
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,760
half dozen that are the super liquid

1546
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,720
points and then the rest of the stuff

1547
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,400
will slowly uh become less liquid so you

1548
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,319
can if you want say look at historical

1549
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,000
data work out what my factors are pick

1550
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,240
the first half dozen factors which

1551
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,920
represent sort of shapes of curve moves

1552
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,480
have those driven by my most liquid

1553
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,000
stuff and use that for a curve. Um that

1554
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,240
works quite well in bond world for

1555
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:44,720
example. So lots of other possibilities.

1556
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,920
Okay, talk briefly about hedging.

1557
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,520
So one of the things you want to do if

1558
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,200
you're running a trading book of some

1559
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,000
sort or asset management or something,

1560
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,000
you want to know what is my risk? um you

1561
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,240
know and risk generally in in the sort

1562
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,559
of trading desk view of the world is how

1563
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,440
much do I make or lose if my say rates

1564
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,559
go up or down. So I'm going to use just

1565
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,440
simple PV1 is my main risk measure which

1566
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,880
is just a sensitiv basis point increase

1567
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,880
you know nothing too I've got a

1568
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,880
two-sided difference here just PV at

1569
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,119
rates plus a bit minus PV at rates down

1570
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,839
a bit normalized by two times the size

1571
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,440
of that do this parameter and I get a

1572
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,599
delta strip and that's typically what

1573
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,800
I'm going to use for hedging that's what

1574
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,720
I'm going to have limits put on me

1575
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,240
former management you know it's what I'm

1576
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,960
going to use and an assortment of other

1577
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,559
things uh very standard approach and you

1578
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,079
can do that for you

1579
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,520
any parameter you want. You work out

1580
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,839
just what is my sensitivity, but

1581
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,680
generally a brute force bump and reval,

1582
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,520
change a parameter, repric, take the

1583
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,720
difference. You can get a bit cleverer

1584
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,559
than that if you want to go to sort of

1585
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,960
analytical hedge computations and things

1586
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,599
like that, but the Gore method is still

1587
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,000
the same.

1588
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,839
So that's first order. I can also, you

1589
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,960
know, depending on my product, you know,

1590
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,119
everything has got a little bit of

1591
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,040
convexity and depending on what my

1592
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,960
trading style is, may or may not matter.

1593
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,200
So I might want to do a gamma which is

1594
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,599
my second order uh risk. Generally the

1595
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,280
change in PV uh squared by D rate

1596
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,359
squared.

1597
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,799
Many definitions of gamma and at least

1598
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,559
in in equity world it's a little

1599
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,480
simpler. In interest rate world it's a

1600
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,280
little more annoying because interest

1601
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,799
rates I said you have a say a yield

1602
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,440
curve that might have 50 inputs on it.

1603
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,880
So my delta will have 50 computations.

1604
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,160
Gamma is going to be that squared

1605
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,799
because I need to bump each of them in

1606
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,480
pairs. 2500 computations is very

1607
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,640
expensive. So you probably don't want to

1608
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,240
do that. So again, you can do a parallel

1609
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,920
gamma or factory gamma, a number of

1610
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,839
other approaches, or just use scenario

1611
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,520
analysis. Lots of ways to get your

1612
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,520
higher order terms uh in there.

1613
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,400
Okay. Um as soon as you start actually

1614
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,400
hedging in practice, you hit a whole lot

1615
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,680
of uh practical issues that you had to

1616
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,839
be aware of. Um you know, how much is

1617
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,200
the uh higher order terms contribute?

1618
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,359
You can have third order terms, fourth

1619
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,520
order terms, cross terms, and so on. All

1620
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,520
sorts of weird convexities.

1621
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,960
How do I choose my bump size? You know,

1622
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,960
the standard is a basis point, but

1623
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,240
that's really just for reporting. And

1624
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,200
this depends a little bit on your

1625
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,799
numerical method and what you're doing.

1626
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,319
So, if I'm in a Monte Carlo world, for

1627
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,920
example, I have a Monte Carlo pricing

1628
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,599
engine, I probably want to bump a little

1629
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,720
bigger because there's Monte Carlo noise

1630
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,559
because it's, you know, it's random

1631
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,079
numbers, it's a little noisy. So, my

1632
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,160
bumps are too small. My difference is

1633
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,000
going to be quite small. some of the

1634
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,559
other methods for example some of the

1635
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,400
PTE based methods if I'm doing a large

1636
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,160
bump I can see grid effects starting to

1637
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,920
hit it so there's a lot of numerical

1638
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,920
issues here and everyone's a little bit

1639
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,119
different

1640
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,480
said there's some sequential bumps

1641
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,480
there's all sorts of little convexities

1642
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,160
come in and I said you're exposed to

1643
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,760
your interpolation method if I'm doing a

1644
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,440
local interpolation my hedges are

1645
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,640
concentrated around my maturity if I'm

1646
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,720
doing a global one they're going to be

1647
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,240
more distributed so this was something

1648
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,680
that again you get into lots of

1649
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,839
arguments with people about pretty

1650
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,839
quickly

1651
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,240
One of the other things to do depending

1652
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,720
on your jurisdiction maybe a regulatory

1653
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,440
requirement is to do your P&L

1654
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,119
attribution. So, you know, I, you know,

1655
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,599
come in in the morning, I've got a set

1656
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,200
of positions, set of whatever market is,

1657
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,280
whatever. At the end of the day, I go

1658
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,440
home, I've made or lost some amount of

1659
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,400
money. So, one of the key questions is

1660
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,000
why? Where did that come from? Am I a

1661
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,440
genius trader? Did I get the market

1662
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
right? that I just have a lot of client

1663
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,079
flow that I you know took a bit offer on

1664
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,160
what happened. Uh it's also a very good

1665
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,559
check on how well your model's working.

1666
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,640
Uh which is interesting.

1667
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,400
So you know the P&L I said from you know

1668
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,559
yesterday close to today's close because

1669
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,480
you can value everything. So how did you

1670
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,160
get that?

1671
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,680
You know generally there's three main

1672
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,440
components and this is also something

1673
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,799
that you will have arguments about till

1674
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,440
the heat death of the universe on

1675
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,440
particularly on the theta component. You

1676
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,599
have a change due to the portfolio. So

1677
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,359
did I buy and sell trades? Did I do

1678
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,040
unwinds? Did things get assigned to me?

1679
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,960
Do I have resets? Did I exercise

1680
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,000
options? All of that will have an

1681
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,319
impact. Uh there's the passage of time.

1682
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,640
That's the complicated one. So I went

1683
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:00,480
home, you know, yesterday and I came in

1684
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,280
today. Market hasn't moved. But what

1685
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,160
does market not move actually mean? Um

1686
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,079
it's a very subtle effect. Um because

1687
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,200
interest rate curves are a function of

1688
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:14,400
you know time versus this. So when I

1689
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,400
move this date to that date, what do I

1690
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,319
hold constant and what do I let change?

1691
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,079
And there there's more than one

1692
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:23,119
intellectually defensible answer to do

1693
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,280
this. Um so anytime I tell people you

1694
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,440
just be very precise, make sure you know

1695
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,880
exactly what you're doing. And again,

1696
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,040
there's lots of defensible answers, but

1697
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,319
you all have to agree on your notation.

1698
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,680
And then finally, there's the more

1699
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,040
common one that people think about,

1700
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,440
which is move. So you know, I'm long a

1701
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,920
billion bonds. I got a, you know, a PV1

1702
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,680
of what is that? $10 million in 01 or

1703
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,480
whatever. Rates moved five basis points,

1704
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,079
I made $50 million. Well done me. Rates

1705
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,200
went down three basis points, I lost $30

1706
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,960
million plus well done me. Um, so market

1707
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,319
impacts easily. Uh, and I said the

1708
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,000
portfolio change is also one of these

1709
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,000
ones. It's mechanically just a pain in

1710
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,839
the ass. You know, you get introduced to

1711
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,160
booking systems and all your operational

1712
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:04,960
flows and things like that which are uh

1713
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:07,040
can confuse things a lot.

1714
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,640
Okay. Finally, you know, just still

1715
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,240
bouncing between subjects. So, we still

1716
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,760
got a few more minutes. Um, you know,

1717
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,160
clearing is another thing that came in

1718
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,160
post 2008.

1719
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:20,799
One of the features in uh 2008 is people

1720
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,599
became acutely aware of their

1721
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,280
counterparty exposure. So, I do a trade

1722
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,440
with you and you know, we do it at zero

1723
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,760
PV initially. Time passes, now it's

1724
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,359
worth $10 million to you. Great. You

1725
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,359
know, this is not realized money. This

1726
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,359
is money I owe you in the future. If I

1727
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,680
go bankrupt, you lose 10 million bucks.

1728
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,359
So, people become very aware of and if

1729
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,040
you go bankrupt, I get a $10 million

1730
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:43,040
freebie. So, you know, assuming I can

1731
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,880
argue with your bankruptcy judge. Uh,

1732
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,640
fine. So, there's a, you know, people

1733
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,839
have been very acutely aware and Lehman

1734
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,079
really brought that home because they

1735
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:52,559
were a huge uh dealer. You know, they

1736
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,920
had many, many billions, hundreds of

1737
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,720
billions of dollars of derivatives with

1738
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,160
people. Um, it by the way is why JP

1739
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,760
Morgan is doing so well now because they

1740
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,079
were the only bank still standing in the

1741
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,160
fall of eight. So people had to replace

1742
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,319
an enormous amount of Lehman hedges and

1743
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,240
JP was the only one still actively

1744
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,319
trading. Goldman's was in trouble.

1745
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,400
Stanley was in trouble. Bank America

1746
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:16,160
where I was just bought Merryill.

1747
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,520
Merryill went bust. Um you know all the

1748
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,680
City Group was having all sorts of

1749
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,319
issues with guaranteed uh credit

1750
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,760
exposures and things. So JP Morgan just

1751
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,680
made out, you know, the bid offers went

1752
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,160
up by about a factor of 20 for a month

1753
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,839
or two there. And you know, they just

1754
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,760
raked it all in. You know, good for

1755
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,240
them, I guess.

1756
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,760
not good for anybody else. So, um, so

1757
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,680
one of the things the regulators decided

1758
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,480
after that was people would have to use

1759
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,680
clearing for vanilla swaps. The clearing

1760
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,839
is a concept that's been around in

1761
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,000
futures forever, but in in swaps it's

1762
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:47,760
relatively new. So, what that means is

1763
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,520
say I'll do a trade with you and we'll

1764
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,599
do a trade fine. You guys, we agree in

1765
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,200
the terms. We will then both assign our

1766
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:57,040
side of the trade to a central clearing

1767
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,480
house. Say CM CME and LCH London

1768
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:01,760
clearing house and the CME are the two

1769
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,839
big ones. So then both of us now face

1770
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,200
say the CME and you and I are now

1771
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,960
separated and we don't care what happens

1772
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,400
to each other. You can go bust and you

1773
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,079
know I'll be sad but I'm not losing

1774
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:14,160
money. So um so that came in and

1775
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:17,280
clearing houses are are generally big.

1776
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,839
Um you know one of the worries is we've

1777
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,000
traded off sort of small and large

1778
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:24,240
potential disasters for a very small

1779
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,400
number of enormous disasters. you know,

1780
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,760
if LCH goes bust, you know, it's time to

1781
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,359
get, you know, guns and ammo and head

1782
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,880
for the hills because it it's going to

1783
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,559
be just a complete disaster in the

1784
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,480
financial world. They are so big and so

1785
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,400
integrated with everything. And all the

1786
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,079
members post various margins to them and

1787
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,000
membership fees. So, no, they're pretty

1788
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,160
robust, but if something did weird

1789
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,960
happen, you know, it would be quite uh

1790
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,880
unpleasant there.

1791
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,640
Okay. Now, one of the things about the

1792
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,799
clearing houses is the dealers are

1793
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,280
required, but you you end up with this

1794
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:55,359
now situation where a dollar I'm paying

1795
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,760
to LCH is not the same as a dollar I'm

1796
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:59,760
paying to the CME. You know, these are

1797
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,400
these are not fungeable amounts even

1798
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,000
though they're both dollars.

1799
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,520
So, it's quite interesting because I

1800
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,319
can't, you know, if I have a swap with

1801
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,440
LCH and I swap with CME, I can't offset

1802
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,799
these two. Um, I can in my books, but

1803
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,559
not in terms of operationally and

1804
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:16,559
collateral and everything. So what

1805
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,400
happened uh probably eight or nine years

1806
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,799
ago is quite a significant spread opened

1807
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,960
up between these two. So this is you

1808
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:25,200
know from 2017 I guess the tradition is

1809
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,720
one of the big uh brokers. You know this

1810
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,160
is the difference between if I want to

1811
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,760
pay fixed on CME versus pay fix and LCH.

1812
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,440
So again if I'm doing a 30-year swap

1813
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,359
it's now three and a half basis points

1814
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,440
between them. And again this is a market

1815
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:40,240
where the bid offer is 0.2 of a basis

1816
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,079
point. So you know the question is why

1817
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,599
did this you know this persisted for a

1818
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,920
long time. It's actually a flipped sign

1819
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,440
recently, but this was around for years.

1820
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,960
Anybody want to guess why this kind of

1821
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,200
new? Why can't I just arbitrage this

1822
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,799
soy? I'll go receive fix and CME. I'll

1823
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,240
pay fix and LCH and I'll collect three

1824
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,400
and a half basis points and, you know,

1825
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,440
go by my island in the Caribbean. Why

1826
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,839
can I not do that? Or why did nobody do

1827
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,039
that?

1828
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:06,559
Anybody want to hazard a guess even?

1829
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,440
It's quite interesting and it's it's one

1830
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:13,680
of the pretty core things in a post08

1831
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,680
world which makes things a lot harder.

1832
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,559
No guesses there. Yeah.

1833
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,119
>> Like is there a spread?

1834
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,119
>> Pardon?

1835
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,960
>> Like is there a spread like when you're

1836
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,559
long something that like you receive

1837
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,839
versus when you're short that's like

1838
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,359
different?

1839
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,559
>> But why does that persist? Why can't I

1840
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,000
just Well, you know, there's enough

1841
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,359
people out there that are happy to make

1842
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,440
money. Why can't they just take that

1843
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,799
out? If you told me I can make three and

1844
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,200
a half basis points running for 30

1845
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:40,839
years, I'll do that all day and that'll

1846
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,839
make me a ton of money.

1847
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,319
Anyway, there's a couple reasons

1848
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,640
the you have to post margin on both

1849
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:50,400
sides. The clearing houses as part of

1850
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,400
doing clearing require you post for a

1851
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,760
swap. It's typically a percent or 2% of

1852
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,599
the notional. So, you have to post money

1853
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,920
to them on both sides. You're now double

1854
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,160
posting margin that costs you and that's

1855
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,920
the main driver of it. Some of the other

1856
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,599
features are other products trade on

1857
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,440
these these clearing houses and you can

1858
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,720
net them. For example, CME is the big

1859
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,319
futures uh counterparty. So if I'm long

1860
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,760
a ton of of interest rate futures and

1861
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,440
short a ton of swaps, I get at least

1862
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,760
partial netting of my margin between the

1863
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:19,359
two. Then there's a couple sort of non-

1864
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,440
less economic things. Um this thing was

1865
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,200
largely driven by some very large US

1866
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,960
asset managers, people like PIMCO who

1867
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,640
was ginormous that wanted to pay fixed

1868
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,480
all day uh to hedge their loan

1869
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,640
portfolio.

1870
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,720
They are a little you know less trusting

1871
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,200
of the LCH because the LCH is owned by a

1872
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,799
consortium of dealers. CME is owned a

1873
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,400
private company. So they their thought

1874
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,920
was the LCH is going to be more

1875
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,720
favorable to dealers because the dealers

1876
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,880
own them. So if it comes down to a juris

1877
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,880
a legal issue or something you're

1878
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,079
they're going to be biased. Um the other

1879
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,160
one is they want it to be in US

1880
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,240
jurisdiction. LCH is in London L being

1881
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,680
in London. Uh and they just want you

1882
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,200
know they want to deal with the legal

1883
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,319
issues in the US because that's where

1884
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,240
they have their expertise and where

1885
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,440
they're based. So a couple things again

1886
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,520
it's quite interesting but one of the

1887
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,359
things this introduces the fundamental

1888
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:05,440
thing is that because of the margining

1889
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,880
requirements there's a spread here that

1890
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,960
can exist between things that would

1891
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,960
formally be arbitrageable

1892
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,680
and it can persist FX has all sorts of

1893
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,680
these too and this is sort of coming to

1894
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,119
the point that actually to correctly and

1895
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,559
completely calculate the prices and

1896
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,200
stuff you need to include a lot of

1897
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,559
things outside of the core pricing of

1898
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,000
the instrument how are you going to

1899
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,680
margin it what capital do you have to

1900
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,119
post it or is there any other kind of

1901
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,119
things like this that are going to cost

1902
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,520
you money that have not traditionally

1903
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,039
been accounted for.

1904
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,119
And I would say one of the huge sort of

1905
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,200
quant efforts over the last 15 years is

1906
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,880
to been work out what are all these

1907
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,359
extra costs and how do I push them back

1908
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,680
into the upfront pricing. You know, if I

1909
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:45,440
if I do a swap for a very small P&L with

1910
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,200
a counterparty and then it turns out I

1911
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,960
have to post an enormous margin. It's

1912
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,960
going to cost me way more than that.

1913
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,240
I've just done a money losing trade. So

1914
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,280
I don't want to do that. That you can't

1915
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,359
do too many of those or you're not

1916
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,280
trading anymore. Um so you have to

1917
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,520
correctly account for all of these extra

1918
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,440
costs and that's quite non-trivial um

1919
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,839
just both mechanically in your system

1920
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,200
side as well as sort of conceptually and

1921
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,440
a lot of these things are portfolio

1922
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,680
effects. So how do I then allocate that

1923
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:13,000
to individual trades is not necessarily

1924
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:13,000
super obvious.

1925
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,559
Okay, good. Coming to the end at about

1926
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,119
the right time. quick quick uh blurb

1927
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,400
about electronic trading which is uh you

1928
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,920
know if any of you guys get into this

1929
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,799
area in your careers this is one of the

1930
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,440
very uh sort of quite interesting very

1931
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,880
hot areas. Um electronic trading has

1932
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,920
been around in equities for quite a

1933
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,680
while. Um my sort of standard metric is

1934
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,359
equities is probably 10 years ahead of

1935
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,440
foreign exchange which is 10 years ahead

1936
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,599
of fixed income. And one of the graphs

1937
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,559
there is from one of the data providers.

1938
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,920
Um sort of the percentage of markets in

1939
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,720
some of the fixed income products that

1940
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,559
are traded electronically.

1941
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,000
You know two basic. There's electronic

1942
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,000
trading which I sit on my keyboard and I

1943
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,200
go all computer does everything or I can

1944
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,640
pick up the phone and I can call

1945
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,160
somebody voice trading. Um so again

1946
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,520
there's a sort of a spectrum here. On

1947
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,599
the right, I've got the very liquid

1948
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,400
stuff, you know, US equity products,

1949
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:10,720
cash equities, those are all 90% plus FX

1950
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,640
spot, all traded electronically

1951
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,799
basically. And then I start to get less

1952
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,319
and less European governments, US

1953
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:18,400
governments, both predominantly

1954
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:21,679
electronic, but you know, we're talking,

1955
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,199
you know, 60 to 80% of the market here.

1956
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,719
What you tend to see is a lot of the

1957
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,880
smaller trades will go through

1958
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,239
electronically for a couple of reasons.

1959
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,920
You know, these are not market moving

1960
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,440
trades, so people are happy to let the

1961
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,359
machine do its thing. you know, if I'm

1962
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,799
buying a million dollars of a treasury,

1963
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,400
you know, that's not going to affect a

1964
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,319
market that trades a trillion dollars a

1965
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,319
day. If I'm buying, you know, hund00

1966
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,920
million, maybe if I'm buying $500

1967
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,199
million, I need to be careful because

1968
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,359
that is going to move the market and

1969
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:46,719
it's going to market against me and I'm

1970
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,279
going to end up paying more than I would

1971
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,719
otherwise do that.

1972
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,080
And the other thing as I get down there,

1973
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,319
so I sort of have some of the investment

1974
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,839
grade corporates, high yield bonds, and

1975
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,600
I get down to the left, which is really

1976
01:08:55,839 --> 01:09:00,640
not electronic, is things like emerging

1977
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,080
market bonds and municipals. Um again

1978
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,480
munis is one of these ones quite an

1979
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,359
interesting market. Um uh before I was

1980
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:09,679
at Missou I was at TD Toronto Dominion.

1981
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,600
Um we acquired a MUN bond electronic

1982
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,839
trading firm from Chicago which was just

1983
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,600
tremendously successful. Uh and they

1984
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,679
have about half of the electronic market

1985
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,759
in munis. So munis is something that

1986
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,040
there are huge number of bonds. There's

1987
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,359
something like three and a half million

1988
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,239
issuers in the country, which is the

1989
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:29,199
states, um the towns, you know, bridge

1990
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:31,120
projects, school boards, all sorts of

1991
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:33,679
things that issue municipal bonds.

1992
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,839
They're all a little different.

1993
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,400
So, there's a lot of non-standardization

1994
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,839
in the actual bond structures. And the

1995
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,960
other thing, there's a tax advantage. I

1996
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,319
don't know if you guys any of you guys,

1997
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,679
you know, have a PA at this point or

1998
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,839
hopefully in the future, not too much

1999
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,920
longer. um you know muni bonds you don't

2000
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:49,679
pay federal income tax on them which

2001
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,920
means they're you know typically the

2002
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,679
yields are about 70% of a taxable issue

2003
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,080
because you get the same net after tax

2004
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:57,760
yield this means it's a retail market

2005
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,600
you know institutional investors don't

2006
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,760
get the tax break so they are less

2007
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,520
interested in unis retail investors

2008
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,120
typically are not buying things in

2009
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,360
blocks of 100 million they're buying

2010
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,520
things in blocks of 5,000 or $10,000

2011
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,480
something like that so the average trade

2012
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,400
size is very small at TD they did you

2013
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,840
know something like5 to10 10,000 trades

2014
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,400
a day, but the average trade size I

2015
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,560
think was $28,000, which in a government

2016
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,920
market is is absurd. That's not even an

2017
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,199
oddlot, but something, you know, the

2018
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,600
janitor picks up at the end of the day

2019
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,600
and just does something with

2020
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,719
um so it's it's quite interesting, but

2021
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,480
on the other hand, you do enough of it,

2022
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,000
you can still make good money. You know,

2023
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,400
emerging markets is another one where

2024
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,719
the bonds are very idiosyncratic and

2025
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,239
there's a lot of sort of very special

2026
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:40,719
stuff. There's not really a generic

2027
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:42,239
Chilean bond. you know, you have to know

2028
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,239
exactly what it is, how is it paid,

2029
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,920
what's the credit support, all of that.

2030
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:48,080
So, these things are generally done over

2031
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,480
the phone with somebody because, you

2032
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:54,000
know, not not for the faint of heart

2033
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,840
there, I would say. Um, but, you know,

2034
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,159
as time goes on, you know, things are

2035
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,600
slowly moving up here and, you know,

2036
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:01,440
things are becoming more electronic. You

2037
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,199
know, electronic is just it's faster,

2038
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,199
it's cheaper,

2039
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:06,400
uh, it's it's you're less sensitive to,

2040
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,679
you know, people taking advantage of,

2041
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,360
but you have markets, you can see where

2042
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,600
the market is.

2043
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,840
They're doing quite a variety of

2044
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,840
participants here. Um, you sort of have

2045
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,239
the trading shops. There's people like

2046
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,560
XDX or Jane Street or Hudson River

2047
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:22,000
Trading or folks like that. You know,

2048
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,920
they don't have customers. They just

2049
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,560
trade on their own account. They're very

2050
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,400
good. They're very fast. You know, they

2051
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,080
generally make markets in a lot of this.

2052
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,320
Telling Peter a story I had at some

2053
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,920
point. Um I was at a Thanksgiving dinner

2054
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,520
or something with a big group of people

2055
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,360
and one of the other people there had

2056
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,000
just graduated from college with a PhD

2057
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:43,040
in physics in microwave guides and he'd

2058
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,800
been employed I think by jump trading uh

2059
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,280
to work out the optimal microwave

2060
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,199
transmission to reduce Chicago New York

2061
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,159
latency because Chicago's where the

2062
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,440
exchanges are New York where the

2063
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,880
customers are and I just remember

2064
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,840
talking to that guy and thinking Jesus

2065
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,600
you know I think I was at Bank of

2066
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,520
America at the time we are never getting

2067
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,840
in front of this you know these guys are

2068
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,600
just there are so advanced in this stuff

2069
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,320
that you have to be very careful to pick

2070
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,000
what you're doing. Um, so you know,

2071
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,679
these guys are are super fast, super

2072
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,600
good. This is a high frequency traders,

2073
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,360
people like that. Then you have the

2074
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,679
dealers, um, which are people like the

2075
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,159
Bank of Americas or or, um, you know,

2076
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,400
TDs, Morgan Stanley's. They generally

2077
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,239
are trading, um, they're pretty good.

2078
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,320
They're fast. They're not building their

2079
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,800
own microwave towers. So, they're doing

2080
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,320
that. They have customers, you know, uh,

2081
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,600
customers are good. Customers want to

2082
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,280
trade with you. The customers will pay

2083
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,440
you a bit offer to do trade with you. So

2084
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,280
you know I like that

2085
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,080
and they're they're sort of you know low

2086
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:38,080
latency but you know microsconds and not

2087
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,679
nanconds and then there's the customers

2088
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,960
who just want efficient execution and to

2089
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,480
get sense that they're not being taken

2090
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,840
advantage of and they're seeing a full

2091
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,600
market and you know they're able to

2092
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,800
decide what they want to do and there's

2093
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,480
a bunch of other guys but those are sort

2094
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,040
of some of the main uh market

2095
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,080
participants here.

2096
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:55,760
So pricemaking here it's it's you know

2097
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,800
at least on on the dealer side which is

2098
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,480
what I'm familiar with. I've never

2099
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,400
worked at a prop shop, so I don't know

2100
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,960
uh if those guys are much different. We

2101
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,640
start by getting a good mid-market price

2102
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,320
u either from liquidity providers if

2103
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,840
it's a something that trades actively or

2104
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,760
from a model if it's something that's a

2105
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,520
little uh

2106
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,560
you know, a little off the run. You're

2107
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,000
then going to sort of skew the

2108
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,600
mid-market price to what you're actually

2109
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,920
going to offer the guy based on a whole

2110
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,040
lot of stuff. Maybe risk, you know, what

2111
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,400
is your current position on this

2112
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,440
product? If this is a risk reducing

2113
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,640
trade, you're willing to be more

2114
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,800
aggressive just to get it off your

2115
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,000
books. If this is a risk increasing

2116
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,199
trade, you're generally going to want to

2117
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,520
be a little more conservative because

2118
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:31,280
it's going to cost you to manage it. You

2119
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,120
know, who's the client? You know, is

2120
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,040
this a good client that it's important

2121
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,800
um you know, for you to keep good

2122
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,040
relations with? You have other other

2123
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,080
transactions as the firm which case

2124
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,000
you're willing to be a little little

2125
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:44,400
more aggressive with him. Is this a

2126
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,679
toxic client?

2127
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,239
It's quite an interesting study of how

2128
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:50,000
do you evaluate client toxicity? And the

2129
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:52,480
classic toxic client is again is some

2130
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,239
sort of fast money guy will put out 10

2131
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,719
requests to 10 different dealers for the

2132
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:58,640
same trade at the same time. So if you

2133
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,080
execute that, you'll then find nine

2134
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,000
other guys have executed the same. So

2135
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,199
your hedge is moved away from you. So

2136
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,320
it's going to cost you more money to

2137
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:06,159
hedge and you're probably losing money

2138
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,840
on the trade. But how do you determine

2139
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:10,080
if that's likely to happen or not? So a

2140
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,159
lot of market microstructure things. Uh

2141
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,600
also volatility. Um you know if the

2142
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,040
market's in a particularly volatile

2143
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,000
period, you're going to want to be a

2144
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,600
little more conservative in your

2145
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,960
pricing. widen out your bid offer

2146
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,040
because the market might move away from

2147
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,400
you before you can hedge. And then

2148
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:26,080
there's a whole world of sort of

2149
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,520
prediction models and um you know how do

2150
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,960
you look at that and and you know what's

2151
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,640
your estimate of where the next tick is

2152
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,920
up or down and things like that and

2153
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,960
there's all sorts of market micro

2154
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,600
structure there. There's quite an

2155
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:38,080
interesting area you can do. Um in

2156
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,679
general the trading requires uh very

2157
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,360
good integrated systems. You need to

2158
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,520
have everything talking everything super

2159
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,120
fast. you can't have, you know, one of

2160
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,960
the bins of our existence at a previous

2161
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,239
firm was the credit check. So, I had to

2162
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,760
get a request from somebody to do a

2163
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,280
trade. I had to determine if we had open

2164
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,400
credit lines with them. By the time that

2165
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,400
answer came back from our credit

2166
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,280
systems, the deal had gone away. So,

2167
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,640
that was a bit annoying. So, um, okay, I

2168
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,840
think I'll end there and just open it up

2169
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,040
for any more questions. I think we got a

2170
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,719
couple minutes still, so I'm happy to

2171
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,159
yak about anything as I said. So, um,

2172
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:08,239
otherwise, I think we'll call it a day

2173
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:11,960
there.

2174
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,960
go skip through some

2175
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,960
>> I guess like one of the main things that

2176
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,280
people have been talking about recently

2177
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:24,159
is just interest rates and like the

2178
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:27,679
recent CL what is your like opinion on

2179
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:29,760
the implications that changes in

2180
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,760
u

2181
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,600
just kind of understand like what type

2182
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,120
of considerations that we can make

2183
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,560
>> you know the biggest one from the guys

2184
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,159
actually managing interest rate policy

2185
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,600
is really inflation

2186
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,199
you know, we've had a burst of inflation

2187
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,719
here driven by things like the COVID

2188
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,199
funds. You know, we pumped an enormous

2189
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,640
amount of money into the economy um to

2190
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,920
stop things collapsing in COVID and

2191
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,000
that, you know, one of the ways that

2192
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,679
showed up was inflation. Um Russia

2193
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,239
invading Ukraine also popped energy

2194
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,760
prices. So, that also popped inflation.

2195
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,199
That's one of the big ones, you know.

2196
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,120
Now, the downside is the Fed's trying to

2197
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,719
balance that with employment. You know,

2198
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,840
generally if rates are high, people are

2199
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,360
not willing to borrow money because it

2200
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,960
costs you more. you know, if I'm going

2201
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,199
to start a business or something, I'm

2202
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,600
going to want to um quite often borrow

2203
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:12,000
money. The other huge connected thing in

2204
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,760
that is home prices. Um you know, when

2205
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,280
you look at, you know, in my lifetime,

2206
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,880
what have I spent money on? You know, my

2207
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,719
house is overwhelmingly the most

2208
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,400
expensive thing I've bought. And then

2209
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,000
also, every time you move, you know, you

2210
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,840
buy furniture and paint and a new roof

2211
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,840
and this so that's also a huge driver of

2212
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,440
economic things. So, so I think in terms

2213
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,560
of we've just I think just kicked into

2214
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,400
an interest rate cutting cycle. U said a

2215
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,440
few weeks ago they dropped it. Um, you

2216
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,520
know, there's some arguments that they

2217
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,199
kept the rates too high for too long,

2218
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,239
but I think they started to cut. So, I

2219
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,159
think the kind of things that you would

2220
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:42,159
look to see is things like mortgages,

2221
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:44,239
uh, home sales activity, business

2222
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:46,000
startups, stuff like that. There's it's

2223
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:47,840
quite pervasive in terms of how much,

2224
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,080
how expensive is money is a huge driver

2225
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,960
of a lot of activity. I don't know if I

2226
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:55,440
answered your question or not, but okay.

2227
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,920
So,

2228
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:01,760
anything else?

2229
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,040
>> Just one question with fixed income. uh

2230
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,000
modeling y

2231
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:08,960
>> uh I would guess that forecasting and

2232
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,560
predicting rate changes would sort of

2233
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:15,199
take a real backseat to sort of hedging

2234
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:18,320
>> well again that's a subtly

2235
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:19,840
>> it's a there's a subtly a subtly

2236
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,520
difference here there's sort of two

2237
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,679
kinds of fixed income research there is

2238
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,840
the economics client-f facing research

2239
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,520
which is a lot about that stuff here's

2240
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,120
my prediction for the economy here's if

2241
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,880
the rates cut this is what I think you

2242
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,480
should do here's the positions and And

2243
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,000
there's the internal area which is IM

2244
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,760
which is more about pricing and hedging

2245
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,280
of transactions which you know we don't

2246
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,560
make any prediction. We don't care. We

2247
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,640
just want to know how to hedge it under

2248
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,840
that point. Uh we're good. So they're

2249
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,120
sort of they're quite different in

2250
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,280
outlook even though they're both sort of

2251
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,800
fixed income research.

2252
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,159
And I have no opinion of where rates are

2253
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,360
going. If I did I wouldn't be standing

2254
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:52,719
in front of you here. I'd be sitting on

2255
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,880
my Caribbean island the pin coladas.

2256
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:57,520
>> Could you could you also comment on the

2257
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:00,560
municipal bond sort of what the

2258
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,320
analytical uh challenges are there? A

2259
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,320
couple of the challenges there are again

2260
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,159
there's there's sort of a set of bonds

2261
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,679
that are very idiosyncratic maybe the

2262
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:10,080
project bond. So this is a bond where

2263
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,400
the um the revenues come off of say you

2264
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,880
know toll tolls on the Pennsylvania turn

2265
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,239
bike they'll bond supported by that. You

2266
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,840
know I don't know about you I have no

2267
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,360
idea on the traffic in the Pennsylvania

2268
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,719
turnbike and what that's likely to be.

2269
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,159
So you know a lot of these things got a

2270
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,920
big whack in COVID for example because

2271
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:25,440
nobody went anywhere for a year so there

2272
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,280
was no revenues to support them. So they

2273
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,239
all got them. Um a lot of the other

2274
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,320
munis um it's about what do you think

2275
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,920
future tax policy is? So let's suppose

2276
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,000
the average federal rate is I don't know

2277
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,080
30% right now. So that means I'm willing

2278
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,400
to take 70% of the treasury rate for a

2279
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,320
mun bond. When I look forward I think

2280
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,880
tax rates are going up or down. I have

2281
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,640
no idea. I would suspect up but you

2282
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,800
never know just given the deficit

2283
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,199
situation but who knows. So there's that

2284
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,560
kind of issue. Um,

2285
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:54,080
a lot of the other issues when we're on

2286
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,280
the trading and the quant side is, you

2287
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,000
know, how do you figure out who's got

2288
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,199
them? You know, so I want some I have

2289
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,040
somebody who wants to buy a bunch of,

2290
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:03,120
you know, double A New Jersey bonds. How

2291
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,360
do I source those? So that's a lot of

2292
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,040
data. That's one one of the reasons mun

2293
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,719
are still very voice driven is the sales

2294
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,239
guys know where the bonds are, so they

2295
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,600
can get them out for you, you know,

2296
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:13,199
whereas the machines just have no idea

2297
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,560
who's got the bonds right now. So it's

2298
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:16,400
hard to source the product at that

2299
