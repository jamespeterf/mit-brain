00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,040
department of electrical engineering and

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,920
computer science and the institute for

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,519
data systems and society at MIT and a

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,679
core faculty member at the Broad

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,800
Schmidt Center, which seeks to create a

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,519
two-way street between machine learning

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,519
and biology. And I'm Elina Clausnitsa,

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,519
an associate professor of medicine at

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,000
Harvard Medical School in Massachusetts

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,840
General Hospital and an institute member

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
at the Broad where I direct the broad

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,559
diabetes initiative which brings

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,640
together clinicians, geneticists and

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,360
computational scientists to uncover

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,320
mechanisms of metabolic diseases and

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
translate them into new therapies. Today

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
we want to share with you an exciting

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,559
challenge that's taking place this

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,800
December. So the Eric and Wendy Schmidt

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,440
Center and the Bro Diabetes Initiative

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,000
are proud to host the obesity machine

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,640
learning competition tackling metabolic

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
diseases. We are collaborating with

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,479
Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,080
Islia, the Kones Medical Center and

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,479
Crunch DAO.

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,119
>> In this competition, we ask, can you

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,759
design algorithms that identify genes

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,560
driving metabolic disease and help us

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,560
find ways to rebalance the system? will

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,799
now explain the biology underlying the

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,520
problem, the data set, and what success

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,680
looks like in this competition. At the

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
heart of this challenge are adiposites,

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
the fat cells that help regulate our

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
metabolism. We'll talk about what

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
happens when there's an imbalance

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,479
between energy intake and expenditure

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,040
and how we can steer fat cells towards

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,439
healthier states. But understanding and

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,520
predicting how fat cells behave isn't

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,399
something we can do by intuition alone.

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
The systems are too complex. Each cell's

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
behavior is influenced by thousands of

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,119
genes and their genetic variations

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,280
interacting in subtle ways. Thankfully,

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,119
current technologies allow producing

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
vast data sets that measure the

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
expression of all genes at single cell

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
resolution. But these huge

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,160
highdimensional data sets are impossible

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,400
to interpret just by eye. That's why

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
machine learning is key. It could allow

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,879
us to uncover hidden patterns, predict

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
how genetic changes ripple through these

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,560
gene networks, and also identify new

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,400
ways to restore metabolic balance. Now,

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,879
for some of our viewers, it may have

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,840
been a while since biology class. So,

64
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,160
Molina, let's start simple. So, what

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,879
exactly are adiposytes and what do they

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,959
do?

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,280
>> Adiposytes are specialized cells that

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,840
regulate how our body stores and burns

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,800
energy. When nutrients are abundant,

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
they store fat as a safe energy reserve.

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,599
But when we need energy, for example,

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,400
during fasting, exercise, or when we are

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,640
cold, they release fatty acids into the

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
bloodstream to be burned as fuel by

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,360
other cell types.

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,160
>> H So are really track what comes in and

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
what goes out?

78
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,239
>> Exactly. That's it. Most of our fat is

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,720
white atapost tissue, which serves

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,440
mainly to store energy. Another function

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,360
of the atapost tissue is thermogenesis.

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,920
the production of heat by burning

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,480
nutrients. This function is partly

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,519
mediated by the expression of uncoupling

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,080
protein one or UCP1. Thermogenesis

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,800
occurs predominantly in brown atapost

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,760
tissue which makes up only about 1 to 2%

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,080
of total body fat. However, a fraction

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,560
of white atapost tissue can acquire

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
thermogenic properties through a process

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,080
known as browning or beeing. So brown

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,360
and beige fat burns energy instead of

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,040
saving it.

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
That's right. And under certain

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,560
conditions like prolonged cold exposure

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,840
or exercise, some white fat can actually

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,400
take on brownlike features. We call that

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
browning. It's like flipping a metabolic

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,519
switch, really. White cells that used to

100
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,080
store fat can start burning it instead.

101
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,159
If we could safely trigger that process,

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,480
it could help us combat obesity by

103
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,840
turning the body's own fat into an

104
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
energy burner.

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
>> H. And I imagine that when that system

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,280
gets totally out of balance, say when

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,280
energy intake exceeds expenditure,

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,680
that's when obesity develops. Yes,

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,000
chronic imbalance of energy intake and

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
energy expenditure together with genetic

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
predisposition drives the excessive

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
storage of fatty acids and white

113
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,000
adipocytes which can eventually lead to

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,400
obesity. Obesity affects 890 million

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
people worldwide. It dramatically raises

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,160
the risk of type 2 diabetes,

117
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,040
cardiovascular disease, and even certain

118
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,600
cancers. But the opposite can be harmful

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,000
too. When adapost tissue is reduced or

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,199
abnormally distributed, as for example

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,600
in lipodistrophe, fatty acids spill into

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,520
other tissues such as the liver, leading

123
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
to insulin resistance and other

124
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,320
metabolic disorders.

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,400
>> So both extremes, too much or too little

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,560
functional fat can really be harmful.

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,880
>> That's exactly it. Maintaining the right

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
amount and function of adapost tissue is

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
key to metabolic health. Two major

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,000
processes keep the system in balance.

131
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
The adapogenic shift which supports the

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,199
formation of healthy fat cells that can

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,759
safely store energy and the thermogenic

134
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,960
shift which activates fat cells to burn

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,600
energy when needed. If we can understand

136
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,320
the gene pathways that regulate those

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,880
shifts, we could potentially rewire fat

138
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,479
cells toward metabolic health. And

139
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,039
that's exactly where this year's

140
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,280
challenge comes in. Modern biology gives

141
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,759
us incredible tools. Single cell

142
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,479
sequencing, crisper pertubations, and

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,120
imaging that let us measure thousands of

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,919
genes across hundreds of thousands of

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,800
cells. But that also means that each

146
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,120
experiment generates massive data sets,

147
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,039
far too large for humans to interpret on

148
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,039
their own. So that's where machine

149
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,600
learning can make a huge difference. It

150
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,919
can help us map how genes interact, how

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,759
they push cells into different states,

152
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,320
and how those states influence

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,880
metabolism. But unlike the algorithms

154
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,600
that power product recommendations or

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,080
targeted ads, we need our algorithms not

156
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,560
just to predict, but to actually reveal

157
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,840
the underlying mechanisms, the causal

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,840
rules that really shape biology itself.

159
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,560
Recent single cell studies have shown

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,960
that edibletites exist in many different

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,039
states. They are far more diverse than

162
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,800
we once thought, but the genes

163
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,360
regulating those states are still

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,919
largely unknown. We can actually study

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
these adipocy states in a test tube,

166
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,520
saving us the complication of working on

167
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,759
human subjects. Edipus tissue contains a

168
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,600
population of progenitor cells that can

169
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,160
become fat cells under the right

170
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
conditions. In the lab, we can nudge

171
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,639
these progenitors to develop into

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,520
different adipocy types. And with

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,319
crisper cast 9 particularly so crisper

174
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,400
interference we can selectively knock

175
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960
down genes during this differentiation

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,919
process by observing how the

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,680
transcriptto that's the activity of all

178
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,840
20,000 genes changes in each cell. We

179
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,479
can start mapping the gene networks that

180
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,880
drive these states. The challenge of

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,039
course is scale. There are thousands of

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,639
single gene targets and hundreds of

183
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
millions of possible two gene

184
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,039
combinations. Testing all of them

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,000
experimentally would be absolutely

186
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,160
impossible.

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,560
>> And that's exactly where you and machine

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
learning come in. Your task is to

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,599
predict how perturbations will shift

190
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,080
gene expression and change cell states.

191
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,639
So we can focus on the most promising

192
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,639
experiments. To make this happen, we

193
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,800
have collected large scale single cell

194
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,919
data from adipocy differentiation

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,240
experiments with crisper pertubations.

196
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,400
Each experiment measures how knocking

197
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,960
down a particular gene changes the

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,880
expression of thousands of others. We

199
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,120
have knocked down genes encoding for

200
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,199
transcription factors, specialized

201
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,319
proteins that regulate gene expression

202
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,960
in individual cells. One data set

203
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,440
consists of single gene perturbations of

204
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,599
150 transcription factors. The second

205
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,919
data set contains combinatorial

206
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,520
perturbations of 15 transcription

207
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,520
factors.

208
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,160
So this means that for each perturbed

209
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,479
gene, we can observe how it rewires the

210
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,039
cell's regulatory network and whether

211
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,599
that shift moves the cell towards a new

212
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,599
cell state. And for a few genes, we can

213
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,919
see how the pertubation is affected by

214
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,360
the simultaneous knockdown of another

215
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,839
gene as well. But of course, we have

216
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
only tested a fraction of all possible

217
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,719
20,000 perturbations and their

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,959
combinations. So the challenge is to

219
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,279
develop algorithms that can predict the

220
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,600
effects of the untested ones and

221
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,640
identify combinations that might most

222
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,560
strongly enhance metabolic health. So

223
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,200
here is the exact breakdown of the

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,760
challenge. In part one, you will predict

225
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,399
the effects of single gene pertubations

226
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,399
on gene expression and cell state. In

227
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
part two, you will predict the effects

228
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,440
of combinations of pertubations

229
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,240
capturing how genes interact with one

230
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,480
another. And finally, in part three, you

231
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
will propose new gene combinations that

232
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,200
are most likely to shift fat cells

233
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,519
toward either energy storing,

234
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,839
adypogenic, or energy burning,

235
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,640
thermogenic states, or potentially other

236
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,480
states. We are really excited to

237
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,959
announce something unique to this

238
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
challenge. The top ranked predictions

239
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,519
will be experimentally tested in the lab

240
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,000
here at the Broad Institute, meaning

241
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,080
your algorithms could directly guide

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,360
biological discovery in obesity

243
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,760
research. Note that a biology background

244
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,600
is actually not needed to participate.

245
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,440
The Schmidt Center will provide all

246
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,760
challenge participants with a short

247
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
online crash course and the Broad

248
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,279
Institute is a global leader in

249
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,920
biomedical research, particularly in

250
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,760
genetic sequencing. So this is a unique

251
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,839
opportunity for you to learn from

252
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,800
leading life science and computational

253
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,480
biology experts. The lecture series will

254
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
take you through the biology of

255
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,720
metabolic diseases along with the

256
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,519
technical knowledge needed to complete

257
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,760
this competition. You'll be really well

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,399
prepared for the challenge at hand. The

259
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,600
challenge will run from December 2025

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,839
through April 2026. You can sign up as

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,760
an individual or a team and we'll be

262
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,160
giving out monetary prizes to the

263
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,800
winners of each part of the challenge

264
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,200
totaling $50,000.

265
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,680
The top algorithms will be presented in

266
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,000
the resulting publications. And as

267
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,000
always, the resulting data, algorithms,

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,079
and code from the challenge will all be

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
made open source for the community to

270
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,240
use. To achieve the goals of this

271
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
challenge, we are going to need new

272
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,040
ideas. new ideas that break through the

273
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
bounds of the traditional approaches

274
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,079
that address the most pressing questions

275
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,640
and ultimately help us intersect machine

276
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,120
learning with biology.

277
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,440
What makes this challenge so exciting is

278
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,760
that it's not just a coding exercise.

279
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,160
It's a way to accelerate real biological

280
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,240
discovery. The predictions you make

281
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,720
could help pinpoint the key regulators

282
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,839
that determine whether a fat cell stores

283
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,640
or burns energy. And by experimentally

284
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,040
testing the top models in the lab, we're

285
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,120
closing the loop between computation and

286
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,160
biology, something that's been a

287
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,240
longstanding goal of our community. This

288
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,399
challenge will show how machine learning

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,600
can drive hypothesis generation in

290
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,680
biology, not just pattern recognition.

291
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,079
Instead of passively analyzing data,

292
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,640
we're using algorithms to suggest what

293
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,360
experiments to do next. And that's the

294
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,839
future, a partnership between biologists

295
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,800
and computer scientists where models

296
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,120
make experiments smarter and faster.

297
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,360
>> Right. If you have ever wanted to see

298
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,720
your algorithm shape what happens in a

299
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,160
biology lab, this is your chance. We

300
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,040
can't wait to see what you'll come up

301
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,040
with and what we can discover together.

302
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,519
>> So, join us for the Obesity Machine

304
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,600
