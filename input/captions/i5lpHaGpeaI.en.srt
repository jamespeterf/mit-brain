1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,800
Okay. So, um so the topic of today is uh

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,119
civ theory and the the large civ um

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,439
which was the first place that I know of

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,279
where proofs like the proof that proofs

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,119
that we've been talking about appeared

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,760
and it appeared in the context of of

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,559
analytic number theory. Um, we'll talk

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,239
about that and then if there's time I'll

9
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,000
try to show you like a really very

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,719
closely analogous thing in the context

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,640
of real analysis. Um, and we'll compare

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,760
it.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,760
Okay. Um,

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,520
all right. So the setting of the large

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,280
civ is that we have a function on the

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
numbers from one up to n. So remember

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,600
that that notation is the integers from

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,600
one up to n and I have a function.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,520
Okay. And then I'm going to think about

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,600
what happens when I

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,080
reduce these integers mod p.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
So um

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,920
uh

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,520
so I'll have pi p of f that's a function

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:36,640
from z mod p to c and the definition is

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:41,200
like this pi pf of a is defined to be

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,439
the sum over all the n= to a mod p of f

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,439
of a.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,759
Okay. Um the setting of the large civ is

30
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,000
I have I have one function f but then I

31
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,799
consider this is sort of a projection of

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,719
f and I consider pi p of f for many

33
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,399
different ps and see what sort of the

34
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,920
typical behavior and how the different

35
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,160
the different ps are related to each

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,200
other.

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,200
Okay. Um

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
okay. Now, as before, we've seen it's

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,760
sometimes helpful to separate a function

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,680
out into its constant part and its mean

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,200
zero part.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,560
So,

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,080
f0 would be so the take the average

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
value. So, 1 / n=

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
1 to n.

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,400
So, that's the average value.

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,480
And then maybe still

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,640
I still have a function on on numbers

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,680
from one to n.

50
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:50,319
Okay. And then the high part of f is f

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:53,760
minus the constant part. So subn

52
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,680
f high of f is zero.

53
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,519
So this is the dangerous notation with

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,519
the I'll make it a capital h.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,159
Okay. And you can do the same thing with

56
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,840
the with the projections.

57
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:13,040
So if I take the projection of f zero,

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,000
it's 1 / p

59
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:21,000
sub a and z by pi

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
p f of a. It's a constant function

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:33,319
and pi p of f pi is pi p of f minus pi p

62
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,319
of f.

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
Okay, a little tiny remark is I was sort

64
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,120
of careful about where to put the

65
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,760
parenthesis, but it doesn't actually

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,560
matter. So,

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:51,040
um, pi p of f high is the same thing as

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:55,280
pi p of f high and

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,080
pi p of f zero is the same thing as pi p

70
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
of x.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
>> Sorry, could you just explain what the

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,040
bracket means on the definition of zero

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,000
again?

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,480
this one here.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,640
>> Yeah.

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,319
>> Um so f0 is a function of let's say m

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
and

78
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
inside the large bracket is a number

79
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,640
which is like the the average value of

80
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,000
f.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,199
>> Oh those are just parentheses here.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,199
>> Those are just parenthesis.

83
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,199
>> Okay.

84
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,280
Okay. So the the theme of the large civ

85
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,759
is that if you take a almost arbitrary

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,800
function here and you look at many

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,520
different projections then the um

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
uh the oscillating part of the high

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,160
frequency part of the projections will

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,720
on average be pretty small whereas the

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,639
um the constant part um well it only

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
depends on the constant part of f but it

93
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,759
will be it could be typically bigger. Um

94
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,479
okay so let me write a theorem which is

95
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,479
makes that sense

96
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,720
I might need just a little more notation

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,720
to state our theorem.

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,720
Okay. So let's say capital P M is the

99
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,280
set of prime numbers P prime in the

100
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,280
range M / 2 less than P less than.

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,479
Okay. So here is the main theorem which

102
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,919
was proven by Linu

103
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:45,600
says that if you have a function

104
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:49,880
n goes to c um and we have an m which

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,880
goes up to square root of n.

106
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,039
Then if I take um

107
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,680
the the sum

108
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,840
p and pm

109
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,840
of pi p of fi

110
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
l2

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:16,240
and that is bounded by

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:16,240
n / m times the sum on n of f of n^2.

113
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Okay,

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,600
so it takes a little bit of work to uh

115
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,120
digest the statement of this theorem and

116
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
like what kind of a bound this is giving

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,080
us. So let's digest it together and and

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
by doing we'll digest it by doing some

119
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,960
applications and then after that we'll

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,960
come back and we'll prove this theorem.

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,319
Okay.

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,800
So,

123
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,880
so there are the character in our story

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,479
is the primes of size about M and it's

125
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
useful to know about how many there are.

126
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,160
So, a background fact from analytic

127
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,639
number theory is that the number of

128
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,240
primes about M is around M over log M

129
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,800
which very roughly I'm just going to say

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,039
is about M.

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,520
Uh, okay. So, there are about M terms in

132
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,720
this sum and it sometimes is helpful to

133
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,639
replace the sum by an average.

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,599
Um so correlary

135
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,599
is that the average

136
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,520
P and PM

137
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,599
of pi P of FI

138
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,599
L2

139
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:39,400
is less than N / M^2

140
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,400
times the sum on M of FI N

141
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,599
Okay.

142
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,880
So as a first application of this, let's

143
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,479
um prove an estimate about uh so so we

144
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,319
so last time I gave the example of the

145
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,080
square numbers. Square numbers have the

146
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,720
interesting property that if you reduce

147
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,639
them mod p for any p you get the

148
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,599
quadratic residues and they're only p+

149
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,280
one over two of them. Um so let's think

150
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
about a situation like that. Suppose you

151
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,000
have a set and when you reduce it modulo

152
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,639
P, you get significantly less than all P

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,520
of the of the residue classes. What does

154
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,520
that tell us about the set?

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:32,240
So there is a corlary

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:35,680
if a is a subset of 1 to n

157
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,919
and pi p of a is significantly smaller

158
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,080
than p. So I'm going to say it's less

159
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,640
than.99

160
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,480
* p just some constant that's less than

161
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,480
one. Um, and

162
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,440
for all P would be interesting, but but

163
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm going to say for all the P in P n to

164
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
the 1/2. So we only actually are going

165
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
to use the primes of size about n^ the

166
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:02,000
1/2.

167
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:05,600
Um, then the conclusion is that the size

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,040
of a is bounded by around n to the 12.

169
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,080
So this would be the this would be the

170
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,519
case if a was the set of square numbers.

171
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
A was the set of square numbers. would

172
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,680
be basically half of P. This would be

173
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
all the primes. So in particular all of

174
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,080
those primes and this set of square

175
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,080
numbers would have cardality n to the

176
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
1/2.

177
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,440
Okay.

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,760
So let's make our function a

179
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,800
characteristic function of a.

180
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,800
All right. Um

181
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:48,959
okay. So

182
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:51,040
if I look at the sum uh a and z mod p of

183
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,560
pi p

184
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:59,519
f of a squared let's so let's say that p

185
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,880
is in this pn to the 12

186
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,959
okay so how big would this be well if

187
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,279
each of these entries if each of these

188
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,880
guys were the same as each other then

189
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:15,200
the size of this thing would be a / p

190
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
and it would be squared and I'd be

191
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,920
summing over p terms.

192
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Right? So if all these values pi pf of a

193
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,519
they were all equal to each other they

194
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,000
would each have size size of a over pum

195
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,760
and then the sum would be like this.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
They could be unequal to each other and

197
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,079
then by koshi schwarz argument they

198
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,839
would this would be even bigger. Okay.

199
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,360
And then simplifying this a little bit,

200
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:43,399
it's

201
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,399
it's around a^2 n to the minus a half

202
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,279
because p is around n^ the half.

203
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,279
Okay. Now what happens if we take the

204
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,920
high part?

205
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,920
Um well

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
because

207
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,680
pi p so the support

208
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,640
of pi p of f that's contained in pi p of

209
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,320
a

210
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:20,480
um so the size of the support

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,800
pi p of f is less than.99

212
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,800
*

213
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,800
That's enough to say that this function

214
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,440
is not super close to a constant

215
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,440
function in L2.

216
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:39,360
So that implies

217
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:42,560
that um the sum and cp

218
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,200
pi p of f high

219
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,400
squared is around the sum without the

220
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,480
high.

221
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,480
[Applause]

222
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,399
So, so all of these L2 norms they're

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,399
they're all big.

224
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,920
Does that feel intuitive to people?

225
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,920
Should we talk about that more?

226
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,160
>> Yeah. Okay. So, let's call let's call it

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,160
a lema.

228
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,240
So, lema is that if I have a function G

229
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,600
um CP to C, it's not really important

230
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,120
that this is CP. It's just a finite set.

231
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,000
Um

232
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,079
and um

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,200
uh and the support of G has size

234
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,200
significantly less than P.

235
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:03,160
Then the conclusion is that the high

236
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:03,160
part of G L2 is around the same as GL2.

237
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,360
Um okay. So, um,

238
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:31,279
okay. So, G is G knot plus G high. And G

239
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,760
knot and G high are always perpendicular

240
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,760
to each other.

241
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Um

242
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,279
so

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,519
so the sum

244
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,519
so gl 2

245
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,519
is around

246
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,519
g2

247
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,199
is equal to g l2 2 plus g high l2.

248
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,040
Um okay.

249
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Um

250
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,079
um so okay if if GL L2 squared was much

251
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,160
smaller than G L2

252
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,000
then clearly G high L2 squ would be

253
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
bigger.

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,839
if G knot

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:43,079
L2 2 um is less than half of G L2.

257
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,079
We're done.

258
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,120
Otherwise, we go the other way.

259
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,760
Um

260
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,760
and um

261
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,639
so

262
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,880
so um

263
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,160
let's say S is the support of G

264
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,519
complement and notice that S is at least

265
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,320
some definite fraction of P

266
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,880
and on S

267
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,600
uh G high is equal to I guess negative g

268
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,360
because they have to add up to to zero.

269
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,040
G vanishes on on on s.

270
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,600
Um so we get

271
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:39,120
g high l2

272
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:42,160
is at least um the sum the sum in s of

273
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,959
of g

274
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,760
squ.

275
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:52,639
But since g is constant

276
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,959
um this is at least s over p times

277
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,040
g l2

278
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,920
which is then at least uh

279
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,360
so s over p is on the order of 1 and g

280
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,519
l2 is on the order of gl2.

281
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,519
So that's

282
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,759
okay.

283
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,639
Okay. So the high part of this

284
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,079
projection has an L2 norm that's

285
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,240
comparable to the L2 norm of the whole

286
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,880
projection which is at least this big in

287
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,680
terms of the size of A.

288
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,120
But the L2 norm of the projection high

289
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,759
pride of the projection shouldn't be too

290
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,480
big by our theorem.

291
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,959
So the theorem

292
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:45,440
implies that the average over p^

293
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,360
12 of this same thing is bounded above

294
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,480
by

295
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,120
n / m^2. My m is the square root of n.

296
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,079
So this just cancels and then I get the

297
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
sum of f of n^2.

298
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,560
So this would be bounded above by the

299
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,560
size of A.

300
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:20,160
Okay. So to summarize this is bounded by

301
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:24,640
this is bounded by this a^2 n^ the minus

302
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,880
a half bounded by a a is bounded by n^

303
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,880
the 1

304
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,440
Any questions or comments about it?

305
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,080
Okay. Okay. So, um, so I feel like it's,

306
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
you know, it's interesting that it

307
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,080
matches the examples of of the square

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,799
numbers. So, it's sort of sharp in that

309
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,520
context. Um

310
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,360
uh but also it would be nice to discuss

311
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,080
more and look at more examples to try to

312
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,960
get a feel for sort of the numerology of

313
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,960
the equations. And a helpful reference

314
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:27,400
point for me is to look at a random set.

315
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,400
So reference point

316
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,520
be a random set.

317
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,840
Okay. So here we're going to take a

318
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,679
subset of the numbers from 1 to n and we

319
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,559
include

320
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,679
each number in a

321
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,360
with probability 1/2.

322
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,799
You could also as an exercise play with

323
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,039
this probability but let's just talk

324
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,559
about 1/2 and you know independently.

325
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,520
Okay.

326
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,440
So um

327
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,160
so

328
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,160
what would we expect

329
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,240
pi p characteristic function at a what

330
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,240
would we how would we expect this to

331
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,240
behave?

332
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:24,320
So this is the number of n uh from one

333
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,320
up to n. So that n= a mod p and n is in

334
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,200
capital a

335
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,559
and each one of those candidates was

336
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,559
chosen with probability a half.

337
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,640
Okay. So,

338
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,880
so the expected value over our choice of

339
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:51,280
a so over the random choice of this set

340
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:55,320
a of pi p1 a little a would be half of

341
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,320
the number of guys here.

342
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,600
So that's essentially um half of n over

343
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
p.

344
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,840
Okay.

345
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,000
But um well you you wouldn't necessarily

346
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
expect this number to be exactly n over

347
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,280
2p every time. If we choose randomly

348
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,159
you'll see some ups and downs. Um and um

349
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,880
uh

350
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,679
um so the standard deviation of the

351
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,039
number that gets picked here would be

352
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,520
the square root of the size of this.

353
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,480
We also would see

354
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,480
that with high probability

355
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,799
the size of the actual size of the

356
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,440
projection minus

357
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,840
the approximate size

358
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:03,000
would be bounded by like the square root

359
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:03,000
of the um of of this

360
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,720
um and it typ typically would have size

361
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,720
around this square root.

362
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:22,400
Okay. So for example

363
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:25,039
uh if if p is in capital p n to the 12

364
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,039
then the actual size of the projection

365
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:32,520
minus its expected size would be around

366
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,520
n to the

367
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,039
Okay.

368
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,200
So let's compare this with what our what

369
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,640
our what our theorem says about an

370
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,640
arbitrary set.

371
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,720
Um

372
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,880
so so what we concluded is for every P

373
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,400
in here and for every A in C mod P

374
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,640
we would have this. So if we took a

375
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,480
random set um and then for every P and

376
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
every A

377
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,440
the difference between the actual size

378
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,559
of the projection and its expected size

379
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,840
would be a square root of the of the

380
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,200
number of choices which would work out

381
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,640
to n^ the 1/4.

382
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,039
We're going to compare this to um what

383
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,600
what our large civ tells us about an

384
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,600
arbitrary set.

385
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,039
Any questions or comments about the

386
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,039
reference setup?

387
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:58,280
So corollary three. So a is any um a is

388
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,280
any subset of numbers up to n.

389
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,120
Then um

390
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,960
if I take the average

391
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:15,200
over primes of size around n to the half

392
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:22,559
um and then I take the average over a z

393
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:29,360
mod p. I take the actual size pi p 1 a

394
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:33,280
and I subtract off the expected size. um

395
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,559
a over a over p.

396
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,720
So this is this is what so we have this

397
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,880
many elements and we reduce them all mod

398
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,320
p. I would expect on average that this

399
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,640
number of them would be congruent to

400
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,880
little a mod b.

401
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:55,400
So then this is bounded by n to the one

402
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,400
and this matches this

403
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,679
Okay.

404
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,760
Um, so

405
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,640
so the proof is uh coropy down what

406
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,640
corlary one tells us and it basically

407
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,640
tells us this.

408
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,799
So we're going to plug in corlary one

409
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:23,279
where um p is pn

410
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:26,720
um where where m is n to the 12. that

411
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,840
will make this disappear.

412
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,919
and cor so corlary one tells us that the

413
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:38,080
average

414
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:46,480
p and pn to the half sum a and z mod p

415
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:50,000
of pi p1 a of a minus a over p^ 2 um is

416
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,799
bounded by the l2 norm of f which would

417
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,799
be the size of a

418
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:06,480
Okay. Um, and that's smaller than n.

419
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,360
Then if I want to replace this average,

420
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,360
this sum by an average,

421
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,039
then I'm going to divide by p, which has

422
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,799
size around n^ the 1/2. So I replace the

423
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,360
sum by the average. Then this is bounded

424
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,840
by n^ the 1/2.

425
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,760
And there's a square here. So I want to

426
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,840
get rid of the square. I would use Koshy

427
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:33,159
Schwarz. Get the average on P, average

428
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,159
on A.

429
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,919
Get rid of this.

430
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,520
So that's the proof of the coral.

431
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,240
Okay. Um

432
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,400
so so the large civ is telling us that

433
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:22,720
if you look at a residue class with a

434
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,039
random P and a random A

435
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,480
then it behaves a so you take an

436
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,559
arbitrary set a worst case complicated

437
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,880
any set at all but then you look at a

438
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,760
random residue class with a random P and

439
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,799
a random A then it behaves a lot like

440
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,799
you had taken a random set.

441
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,799
Um, okay. So, a cute application of this

442
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,799
is if a is the set of primes and there's

443
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,559
a fun question as a interesting question

444
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,360
in number theory. How many primes are

445
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,039
there in some arithmetic progression?

446
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Um,

447
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,880
so that that's exactly this thing. A is

448
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,640
the set of primes and this is telling us

449
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,480
how many primes there are that are

450
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,760
congruent to A modulo little B.

451
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,720
Um and um

452
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,559
and

453
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,559
so the question is how evenly

454
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,440
distributed are the primes among these

455
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,120
different arithmetic progressions? And

456
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,360
the conjecture would be that for every

457
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,440
little p and every little a that's not

458
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,880
zero, this is always true.

459
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,720
Um, and this corlary actually makes some

460
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,919
progress towards that. It says we don't

461
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,679
know that it's true for all the little

462
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,480
P's and all the little A's, but we know

463
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,840
it's true for most of them.

464
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,840
Now, it's a little bit silly to call

465
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,360
that a correlary about about the primes

466
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,799
because it uses nothing about the

467
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:50,320
primes. It just uses the fact that the

468
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:54,240
primes are a set of numbers. Um but um

469
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,039
uh okay but but that line of reasoning

470
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,559
is actually important in some of the

471
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,840
some of the things we know about the

472
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,880
questions how well are primes

473
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,720
distributed modulo p okay okay so next

474
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,039
class we'll come back to the question um

475
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,080
how much do we know about uh about this

476
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,799
function when a is the set of primes um

477
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,320
and we'll do the the bombiier venogradov

478
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,000
theorem which is not quite the

479
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,600
state-of-the-art but for many many years

480
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,640
was the state-of-the-art about about

481
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,360
this question. Um

482
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,760
and well yeah any it uses these ideas in

483
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,760
a crucial way.

484
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,919
Okay. So that was my survey of some

485
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,159
applications of this large civ

486
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,520
inequality and next we'll prove the

487
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,520
large civ inequality itself.

488
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,159
Oh, there's actually there was one other

489
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,080
thing I wanted to say. So, okay. So,

490
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,080
imagine that a was a set of size n /2.

491
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,440
Then,

492
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:02,320
um this thing here

493
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,720
would have size about n over p which

494
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,760
works out to about n^ the 1/2 and this

495
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,520
thing has size about n to the one half

496
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,720
and the error is about n to the one

497
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,120
quarter. So this thing here is the pi pi

498
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,279
p of f sub0.

499
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,640
And so what what we're seeing here is

500
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:26,799
that the um the pi p of f0

501
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:30,080
is much larger than pi p of f high at

502
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,720
most of the points. So say in L2.

503
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,840
So when we we take a set of size n /2

504
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,480
and we look at all these different

505
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,080
projections, a typical projection looks

506
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,600
almost constant. it's a constant

507
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,279
function plus something that's much

508
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,919
smaller.

509
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,399
Um, so this process of taking a random

510
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,399
function takes a set with with no

511
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,320
structure and it produces something

512
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,520
that's almost constant. And people

513
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,000
sometimes use the word that the

514
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,840
projections are getting uh smoother. And

515
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,440
when we do the real analysis version a

516
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,520
little bit later in class, we'll see

517
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,679
that smoother is is exactly the the

518
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,679
right word.

519
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,520
Cool. Okay. Um yeah so I think that's a

520
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
good way to summarize what the largest

521
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,360
div is telling us it says if we take a

522
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,360
set A which is a pretty decent fraction

523
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,880
of the numbers from one to n and then

524
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,279
when we look at all the projections of

525
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,600
it most of those projections are almost

526
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,679
constant

527
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,640
and that's relevant for this question up

528
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,760
here because um you know if we

529
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,480
hypothesize that pi subp of a is has

530
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,240
size smaller than.99 of p that's telling

531
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,080
us the projection is really not very

532
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,559
constant

533
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,000
And that's only possible for small sets.

534
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,760
So that's where we get that upper bound

535
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,279
on the size of a. If a was bigger than

536
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
that, then it would start to be the case

537
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,039
that the projections of A would have

538
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,720
pretty would would look pretty constant

539
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,799
and it would then it would be impossible

540
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,520
that the support would be that small.

541
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,399
>> Yeah.

542
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:59,279
>> What does P tell the capital P to the 12

543
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,840
mean?

544
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,039
What does

545
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,000
>> under the average

546
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,840
>> this one

547
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,440
>> oh sorry that's P in so capital P n to

548
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,279
the half is the set of primes of size

549
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,600
about n to the half and this is this

550
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,600
prime is one of them yeah thanks for

551
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
thanks

552
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:29,440
okay

553
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,440
so next um let's prove Linux theorem

554
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:37,700
[Applause]

555
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,480
Um so the proof of Linux theorem is

556
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,159
based on the forier transform. So we're

557
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,919
going to take the fora transform of all

558
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,600
of these characters and then we're going

559
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,480
to see how the different fora transforms

560
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,799
are related to each other.

561
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,880
Um so first let me remind you how the

562
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,200
for a transform works for uh functions

563
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,200
on the integers and functions on z mod

564
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,840
p.

565
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,919
So f is going to be a think of it as a

566
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:12,720
function on the integers which is

567
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,039
supported in in this set one of tan

568
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,960
and so if I take its fora transform what

569
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,159
does that mean the for transform is

570
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:26,159
going to be a function on r mod z and

571
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:32,240
it's defined by f of c is the sum on n f

572
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,120
of n eus 2 pi i c do n c that's the for

573
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,880
transform

574
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,159
And it has a forier inversion and it has

575
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,640
a planter route. And they go like this.

576
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,120
Forier inversion.

577
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:49,039
It tells us that

578
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:54,000
f of n is the integral from 0 to 1 f of

579
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:57,440
c e 2 pi i cn dx.

580
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,960
And there's a planer.

581
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,559
And it tells us that the sum on n of f

582
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:09,480
of n^2 is the integral from 0 to 1 norm

583
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,480
of fat x c^2 dx.

584
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,240
Okay. So this is probably most familiar

585
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,000
backwards from the way I've written it.

586
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,000
If you started with a function on r modz

587
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,480
z a periodic function you would take its

588
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,399
forier series and if you sum the forier

589
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,480
series you get the function. This is the

590
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,760
same thing. We've just chosen to label

591
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,760
the for a series by f and the uh

592
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,960
function on the circle by fhat.

593
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,960
Okay. And then

594
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,880
we will also have a function on z mod p.

595
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,320
So suppose I have a function z mod p

596
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,039
goes to c. Then its fora transform will

597
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,120
also be a function z mod p goes to c.

598
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,039
And the definition is ghat of uh alpha.

599
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,240
So I'll say that this variable is called

600
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,600
a and this variable is called alpha. So

601
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:07,919
ghat of alpha will be the sum a and z

602
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:11,919
mod p g of a eus 2 pi i a alpha over p.

603
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,000
And then we have fora inversion

604
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:19,760
which tells us that g of a can be

605
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:23,359
recovered as 1 / p sum alpha and z mod p

606
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,440
ghat of alpha e to the 2 pi i a alpha

607
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,599
over p

608
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,240
and uh and planer

609
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:37,119
that tells us that the sum on a norm of

610
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:41,399
g of a^ 2 is 1 / p * the sum on alpha

611
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,399
norm of g of alpha square.

612
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,240
Okay, so that's how the for transforms

613
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,760
works for each of these worlds.

614
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,280
And now we're going to put it together.

615
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
So if I start with a function on the

616
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,240
integers, I reduce it mod p to get a

617
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,680
function on z mod p. How does this for a

618
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,119
transform relate to this for a

619
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,119
transform? Okay.

620
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,030
[Applause]

621
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Okay.

622
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,760
So, lama I'll call this lama dictionary.

623
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,880
This is a dictionary between the integer

624
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:55,760
world and the mod p world. And it says

625
00:35:50,880 --> 00:36:01,160
that if I take pi p of f hat of alpha

626
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,160
that is fhat of alpha and vp.

627
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,599
Okay the proof is just unwinding the

628
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,920
definitions of what all these for

629
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,480
transforms mean. So what does it mean pi

630
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:19,839
pfhat of alpha? Pi PF hat of alpha

631
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:27,920
that's the sum a and z mod pi

632
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:32,839
pf of a e - 2<unk>i i a alpha over p

633
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,839
okay now who is pi pf of a

634
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:44,320
sum a and z mod p open parenthesis sum

635
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:51,000
n= a mod p of f of n

636
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,000
e - 2<unk>i i a alpha.

637
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,920
All right. Now, if you look at this

638
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,280
double sum,

639
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,280
we're just summing over all the x.

640
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,960
And now let's look at the thing that

641
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,800
we're summing.

642
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:15,599
So

643
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:20,320
uh n= a mod p that tells us that e to

644
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:26,720
the - 2<unk>i i n alpha / p is the same

645
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:28,400
as e - 2 pi i a alpha p.

646
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,680
Why? I have different ns that are

647
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,960
congruent to a mod p. So I think of

648
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,000
adding a multiple of p to this n. that

649
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,720
multiple of P the P cancels with that P.

650
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,560
So we're changing this by an integer and

651
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,160
it doesn't change the value of of it.

652
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,520
Okay,

653
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:57,800
so this is just the sum over n f of n e

654
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,800
to the - 2 pi i n alpha p.

655
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,520
Cool.

656
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,880
Um, another little remark, this is

657
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,680
something we basically saw last time

658
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,400
that if you take the high part of pi p

659
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,079
of f and it's l2 norm squared. If you

660
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,920
take the high part of it, what it means

661
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,880
is that we removed the zero frequency.

662
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,640
So I guess I'll also call this a lema,

663
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,960
but it's very similar to things we've

664
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,960
already proved.

665
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:39,599
So pi pfi

666
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,599
L2 squared is the sum on the nonzero

667
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,599
alphas.

668
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,520
Okay.

669
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,400
Okay.

670
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,440
Um, so,

671
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,880
so now we have a way of writing. So,

672
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,960
let's look at the theorem we want to

673
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,520
prove. We're going to take a sum over

674
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,079
different ps of the L2 norms of the high

675
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,920
parts of pi p of f.

676
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,240
These lemas give us a way of writing

677
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,599
that and translating it into a sum that

678
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,599
involves the for transform of f.

679
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,359
Yeah, I guess one last remark is um

680
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,480
so so pi p of f hat of alpha is fhat of

681
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,079
alpha over p that's for any function f

682
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:52,320
and so if I were to take pi p of f high

683
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,320
hat of alpha that would be fi hat alpha

684
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:02,000
Okay. So now let's let's write out the

685
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,720
left hand side of Linux theorem using 4A

686
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,720
using the 4A transform.

687
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:26,560
Okay.

688
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:32,240
Um, so the left hand side of our

689
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:36,160
theorem, I'll just copy it. The sum p in

690
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:42,680
primes of size m

691
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,680
pi p of f high part l2 squ.

692
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:53,640
Okay.

693
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,640
So that's now some pinp

694
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,760
on the nonzero alpha n cp

695
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:06,440
um

696
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,440
pi p of fi hat of alpha squared

697
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:16,480
which is equal to some p of pm

698
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:23,720
some alpha not equal to zero np

699
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,720
of fi fi hat of alpha over p

700
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,560
norm

701
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,800
cool. Okay, so we're taking the 4A

702
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,440
transform of the high part of f and

703
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,400
evaluating it at a set of points norm

704
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,200
squared and adding them all up. Uh let's

705
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:58,640
visualize that set of points.

706
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:02,640
So let's say qm is the set of uh alpha

707
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,240
over p where p is a prime of size around

708
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,319
m and alpha

709
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,760
is strictly positive and less than or

710
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,760
equal to p minus one.

711
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:27,119
Okay, so um the size of qm is roughly m

712
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,040
squ. So we mentioned before how many

713
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,760
choices are there for this prime p? It's

714
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,000
about m over log m which is roughly m.

715
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,240
And then for each prime there are

716
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,680
basically p choices of alpha which is

717
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,800
also around m. They're roughly m squ of

718
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,800
these um quotients.

719
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,400
Um and an important fact about these

720
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,720
quotients is that they're distributed

721
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,560
quite evenly on the real line. So

722
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,079
they're about m^ squ of them and the

723
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,319
distance between any two of them is at

724
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,040
least m^2.

725
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:02,319
So here's a lema.

726
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:05,680
Um, if alpha 1 over p1 and alpha 2 over

727
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,680
p2 are in qm and they're not equal to

728
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,640
each other,

729
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:16,920
then the distance between them

730
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,920
is at least 1 / m^2.

731
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,640
Okay, proof. Um, we're just going to put

732
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,720
it over a common denominator.

733
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:30,000
Alpha 1 P1 Alpha 1 over P1

734
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:35,359
minus Alpha 2 over P2

735
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,359
is alpha 1 P2 minus alpha 2 P1 over P1

736
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,359
P2

737
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,920
by assumption there the difference is

738
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:49,119
not zero um and so this numerator is not

739
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,079
zero um and so this it's an integer so

740
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,079
it has norm at least

741
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,640
some say at least that big.

742
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,240
Okay. Um I guess to be careful I should

743
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,960
also say that if you know if P1 is

744
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,359
different from P2 then these two are

745
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,960
never equal to each other.

746
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,960
So we never so the importance of making

747
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,520
these primes is that um we never have

748
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,000
the same number written as a fraction in

749
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,520
two different ways here.

750
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,160
So let's also make the remark

751
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,920
that um

752
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,520
uh

753
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:37,280
if alpha 1 over p1 equals alpha 2 over

754
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,599
p2 um in qm

755
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:44,440
then it must be that alpha 1 equals

756
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,440
alpha 2 and p1 equals p2.

757
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,280
Okay. Um,

758
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,280
cool.

759
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,230
[Applause]

760
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,280
All right.

761
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,200
So, I'm going to erase the dictionary

762
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,400
lema and I'll make a picture of this set

763
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,400
and of what we're what we're doing.

764
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,240
Okay,

765
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,240
here's a picture.

766
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,520
So, here's the line from 0 to one. And

767
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,839
on this line we have this set Q subm

768
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,359
which is maybe not quite that evenly

769
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,240
spaced but it's it's quite evenly

770
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,440
spaced. So that's Q sub.

771
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,880
Okay. And then we have we're interested

772
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,119
in the uh our formula involves the the

773
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,119
norm of squared of the 4A transform of

774
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,119
f.

775
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,920
Let me put that on this axis.

776
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:24,319
Okay. So, um, so this will look however

777
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,000
it looks.

778
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:29,000
Okay. We'll talk about this a little bit

779
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
more.

780
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:39,440
All right.

781
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:43,119
So what what we're taking in that sum is

782
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:47,560
we're finding the actual values at these

783
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,560
points and we're adding them up.

784
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,400
And this sum might remind you a little

785
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,240
bit of a remon sum that would help to

786
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:00,079
give an approximation of this integral.

787
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,599
And indeed we're going to compare this

788
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,200
sum to this integral.

789
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,560
Um,

790
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,680
okay. Now, there is a way that the sum

791
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,240
could be a lot bigger than the integral,

792
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,079
which is a narrow peak like this. You

793
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,079
know, if if the function is very big at

794
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,319
this one point, but the peak is

795
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,760
extremely narrow, then it wouldn't

796
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,319
contribute much to the integral, but

797
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,480
it's still there as part of our sum. So,

798
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,920
it's important to know sort of how

799
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,440
narrow a peak like this can be. And the

800
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,960
heristic

801
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,560
which is similar to heristic we've

802
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:42,160
talked about before is that the function

803
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:47,160
fi hat of c is roughly constant

804
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,160
on intervals of length 1 / n

805
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,720
because remember that f is supported on

806
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,800
the numbers from 1 to n.

807
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,839
Okay. So we'll make this precise in a

808
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,520
moment. Uh so I'll draw in what it means

809
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,960
that this peak here should have width at

810
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,480
least 1 / n.

811
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:12,240
Okay. And I'll also make a remark that

812
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,640
um m is less than or equal to n^ the 12.

813
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,040
That's one of the hypotheses in in Linux

814
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,760
theorem.

815
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:22,640
And so that guarantees

816
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,040
that the spacing between consecutive

817
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,920
points of QM

818
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,839
is smaller than this one overn.

819
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,640
So the picture is sort of right that you

820
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:34,000
know this 1 / n is smaller than the

821
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,000
distance between the different points of

822
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Q.

823
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,240
Okay. So this is just a heristic but

824
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,760
let's follow it for now and we'll see

825
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,359
that it basically gives the inequality

826
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,800
that we want and then we can come back

827
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:53,400
and prove things rigorously.

828
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,400
Okay. So the heristic tells us

829
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,280
that um

830
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,079
the sum

831
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,240
c and qm

832
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:11,240
fi hat of c^ squared

833
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,240
um

834
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,440
is bounded by

835
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:23,319
n times the integral from 0 to 1

836
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,319
fat high x^2

837
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:32,000
y. So take a one term of this sum say

838
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:36,079
from this point that one term is bounded

839
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,880
by n times the integral on this um

840
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,040
interval around here of of side with 1 /

841
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:45,079
n

842
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,079
which is a piece of this integral.

843
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,800
Okay.

844
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,079
Okay. Okay. So, the rest is just

845
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,680
algebra. And it's a little bit um

846
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,839
annoying to get all of the constants

847
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,280
right in the algebra, all the exponents

848
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:31,240
right. And in fact, I have already

849
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,240
messed it up a little bit.

850
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,720
So if we go back here, um the left hand

851
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,400
side of the theorem is indeed this sum.

852
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:49,200
I would just copied that correctly. Um

853
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:51,680
and then for the sum, I did planer. But

854
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,680
when you do planer mod p there's this

855
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,079
factor of one over p that I forget

856
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,599
frequently. So there's a one over p

857
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:06,040
there. Now the one over p the p has size

858
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:06,040
about m. This is around 1 / m *

859
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:22,079
all right. So the left hand side of the

860
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:25,280
theorem is actually around 1 / m * this

861
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:30,440
sum over here. So that would be bounded

862
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,440
by n / m * this integral

863
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,559
and then we use plan again and this time

864
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:42,880
there's no factor that I have trouble

865
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:45,880
remembering. So that's n / m sum n f of

866
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,880
n^2.

867
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,880
Okay. So this is the lin theorem.

868
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,839
Okay.

869
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,720
Yeah, let me mention in this picture uh

870
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,559
so we had this theme that if you you

871
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,359
take one function and you reduce it mod

872
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,359
p for many different ps most of them are

873
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,079
almost constant.

874
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,920
So why the constant frequency is special

875
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,319
compared to all the other frequencies in

876
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,319
this story?

877
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,040
Okay. Um so

878
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:49,040
um so let me shade in for one particular

879
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:52,319
prime the frequencies alpha over p.

880
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:57,400
So that would be frequencies alpha over

881
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:57,400
p1 alpha and zp1.

882
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,160
Let me do it for another prime.

883
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,960
So, and the color blue, I'll draw alpha

884
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,880
over P2.

885
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,200
Alpha and Z mod P2.

886
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:21,440
What would that look like? Well,

887
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,960
crucially, it would still have zero,

888
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,960
but all the other ones would be

889
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,960
different.

890
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,559
Okay. So now imagine doing this with all

891
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,240
the different primes in our set of

892
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:41,200
primes. P subm I would get a whole

893
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,160
rainbow of different stuff. Zero would

894
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,839
be in every color. But other than that

895
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,160
each point is only one color. There are

896
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,160
no other overlaps.

897
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,400
Okay. Now fhat can be distributed

898
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,160
anyway. We've assumed nothing about the

899
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,319
function f except that it's supported

900
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,720
from one to n. So we know nothing about

901
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,480
its fora transform except for this

902
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,079
heristic.

903
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,400
So fhat could look like anything

904
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,480
but um

905
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,280
well most of the places that you put

906
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,599
fhat. So okay so one thing we do know is

907
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,280
let's say we know the sum of f the L2

908
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,200
norm of f. So we know the L2 norm of

909
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,640
fhat.

910
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,720
If you stick some mass of L2 norm of

911
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,480
fhat over this point, it will contribute

912
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,160
to this one prime but none of the

913
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,640
others.

914
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,839
But if you stick some mass over zero, it

915
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,160
will contribute to everybody.

916
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,079
So zero frequency is being counted very

917
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,760
differently from any other frequency.

918
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,160
Every other frequency only contributes

919
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,960
to one prime, but the zero frequency

920
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,960
contributes to all primes.

921
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,040
Okay. So therefore, if you if I start

922
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,359
with my function f, if it has a decent

923
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,280
amount in the zero frequency, then all

924
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,680
the different ps also will see a decent

925
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,359
amount in the zero frequency.

926
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,760
And then my function may have a bunch of

927
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,640
other frequencies, but each one of them

928
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,480
is only contributing to one prime. So

929
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,559
kind of uh if I average over all the

930
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,760
primes, those get damped down a lot

931
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:14,640
compared to the zero frequency.

932
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,240
So that's what's go that's a

933
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:20,280
possible a possible intuition about

934
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,280
what's going on in the large s.

935
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,240
Okay. So the last thing to uh to round

936
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,920
out our proof of the large s is we'll

937
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,400
actually rigorously prove this heristic.

938
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,480
Um any questions or comments before we

939
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,480
do that?

940
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,400
Well, it seems like we have more freedom

941
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:49,040
to choose f here than in the like

942
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:53,400
reality.

943
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,400
We always just choose fing.

944
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,799
>> Yeah. So the question is um do we do we

945
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,480
choose f? So here f doesn't have to be

946
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,160
the characteristic function of a set.

947
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,319
We've often talked about f being the

948
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,520
characteristic function of a set. What's

949
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:11,680
up with that? Um

950
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,880
uh we'll also do something at the end of

951
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,799
class we'll mention something in the

952
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:21,079
real setting where f doesn't have to be

953
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:21,079
a characteristic function. Um so

954
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,160
yeah so there so there are there are

955
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,920
some theorems that become interesting

956
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,920
where f is a is a characteristic

957
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,640
function of kind of a sparse set and

958
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,000
that sparity comes into play. Um and

959
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,280
there are others where f could just be

960
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,880
anything there.

961
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,880
They're both they're all part of the

962
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,880
theory.

963
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Okay.

964
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,119
Um

965
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,640
So this heristic, this locally constant

966
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,680
heristic is similar to the one that's on

967
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,680
the homework that you're thinking

968
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,119
through that's due tonight. And by the

969
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,559
way, there are office hours after the

970
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:24,720
class for anybody who would like to talk

971
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:26,880
about that or anything else. Um so yeah.

972
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:31,520
Okay. So I'll also prove this in class.

973
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:34,079
Um and um yeah. All right.

974
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,960
So how does it work?

975
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:41,119
I'm gonna choose a function CN. It's a

976
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:46,160
function Z to C. So that CN of little N

977
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:49,839
is one if N is an integer from 1 to N.

978
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,839
And CN is also um smooth and rapidly

979
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,839
decaying.

980
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,200
Okay.

981
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:08,240
Um so then when I take the fora

982
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:12,960
transform of CN behaves like this

983
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:16,640
so it's around n if the frequency c has

984
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:20,200
size less than 1 / n and then it's

985
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,200
rapidly decaying.

986
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,839
So in pictures, so C is only well

987
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,319
defined modulo one. And in this context,

988
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:30,079
it's nice to draw the modulo one as

989
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:34,040
going from negative a half to positive a

990
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,040
half. Here's zero.

991
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:44,559
So this axis has the norm of CN C. This

992
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:47,119
is N. And this distance here is one N.

993
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,119
That's what it looks like.

994
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,720
Okay. And rapidly decaying could mean

995
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,720
rigorously

996
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,720
n*

997
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,960
c * n. So once c is bigger than 1 / n,

998
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,000
this thing starts to be bigger than one

999
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,880
and kick in. And we could throw in that.

1000
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,880
>> Yeah.

1001
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,799
>> What does smoothness mean for a map from

1002
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:11,640
the integers?

1003
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:11,640
>> Yeah. What does smoothness mean? Um,

1004
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:16,319
>> right. Um you you could think of C as a

1005
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,240
map that's defined on the whole real

1006
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,319
line and it's smooth on the whole real

1007
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,720
line and then we happen to be evaluating

1008
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,720
it at the integers.

1009
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,839
Okay.

1010
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:48,720
Um okay. Now this is helpful because

1011
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:51,040
f is equal to f * cn.

1012
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:55,200
If so, if the support of f is contained

1013
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,960
in integers up to n.

1014
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,319
Um and then when we take the for

1015
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,680
transform we get that f hat is f hat

1016
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:07,839
convolved with cn hat.

1017
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:12,000
And so in particular um so fhat at a

1018
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:14,400
particular frequency of v is c is fhat

1019
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,520
convolved with cn

1020
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:20,640
c. Chat looks like that.

1021
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:25,440
And so the norm of fhat is bounded by

1022
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:28,319
the norm of fhat convolved with cn hat.

1023
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,040
And also the norm of fhat squared is

1024
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:36,240
bounded by the norm of fhat squared

1025
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,760
convolved with cn hat by koshi schwarz.

1026
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,960
So what actually one feature of this

1027
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:46,920
formula is that the integral of cn hat

1028
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,920
xc dx c is bounded by one.

1029
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:01,160
It has height one and it has width

1030
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,160
height n and width one n.

1031
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:12,880
>> Sorry. So head is the for transform of S

1032
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:19,559
in the sense of real function and

1033
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:19,559
or is the form in the sense of

1034
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:26,160
>> okay yeah there's a good question

1035
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:29,760
there's a good question okay so um

1036
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:32,799
all right so there's so I originally

1037
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,240
said is a function on the integers But

1038
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,319
in answer to the question, what does it

1039
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,559
mean to be smooth? I said we should also

1040
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:43,280
think of it as a function on the real

1041
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:45,200
line. So I'll call them SN integers

1042
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,079
that's our function on the integers and

1043
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:50,400
P n real line that's a function on the

1044
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,200
real

1045
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:57,839
and they each have a fora transform

1046
01:01:53,200 --> 01:02:05,280
s on the integers hat of c is the sum

1047
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:08,240
over integers s n of n eus 2 pi i n c

1048
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,559
and s n if you think of it as a real

1049
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,520
valued function It has a 4A transform

1050
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:19,200
and XC that's defined to be the integral

1051
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:23,400
over the real line s of x e - 2<unk> iix

1052
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,400
xc dx

1053
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,000
okay so the question was um when I write

1054
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:31,839
n hat which one of these two things do I

1055
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,040
mean

1056
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:38,640
okay so I mean this one but they're

1057
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:42,119
equal to each other so the

1058
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,119
summation theorem

1059
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:52,079
says that

1060
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:55,799
C and Z hat is equal to of C

1061
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,799
is equal to

1062
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,720
right is that right

1063
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,400
wait

1064
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:06,720
so these are closely related

1065
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,720
for a

1066
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:34,440
Yeah. So this guy is the sum uh Z and Z

1067
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:34,440
of C and R hat of C plus Z.

1068
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:45,400
Okay.

1069
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,400
Um, so we should make two pictures

1070
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:58,839
in yellow. I will draw C and R hat.

1071
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,839
Let's extend this.

1072
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:07,359
It looks basically the same.

1073
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:11,480
And then it gets really small

1074
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:11,480
and it stays really small.

1075
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,839
And

1076
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:22,280
what does so in blue I'll do at z hat.

1077
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:30,000
It looks really almost the same

1078
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,400
except

1079
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,480
this one is periodic. This 4A transform

1080
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,400
is defined on R modulo Z. So it's going

1081
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:40,720
to be periodic Z periodic. So then here

1082
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,799
at minus one,

1083
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,720
it's going to go up again. So there's

1084
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:48,280
going to be an identical copy. The blue

1085
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,280
one is Z periodic.

1086
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:01,280
Okay. Um so if you compare so then if

1087
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,440
you know if you look at this formula it

1088
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,599
is also it's taking this function and

1089
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,960
turning it into a z periodic function by

1090
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:11,200
periodizing it and since this function

1091
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,119
originally was extremely localized to

1092
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,960
between minus a half and a half. It

1093
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,039
almost looks like I took the yellow

1094
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,280
function and I just took copies of it

1095
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,400
and put them here.

1096
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:25,039
Um so the you know the the the copy over

1097
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,839
here can

1098
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:29,359
Yeah. Sorry. Okay.

1099
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:31,200
Anyway, so that's what that's what this

1100
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:34,920
one that's what this one looks like and

1101
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,920
what this one looks like.

1102
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:44,640
Okay. Um so to prove this estimate first

1103
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:48,079
you prove it for C and R and you can do

1104
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,599
that using rate for analysis over R and

1105
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,000
you use the smoothness and you integrate

1106
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:55,280
by parts many times

1107
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,680
and then to study the one over Z you use

1108
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:00,559
this formula and because this guy is

1109
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:03,680
decaying so rapidly the contribution

1110
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,559
from the so if C if if if this C is

1111
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,720
between minus a half and a half then the

1112
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:12,960
contribution coming from integer Z other

1113
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,640
than zero is incredibly small.

1114
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:19,079
Anyway, so so the bounds for this one

1115
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,079
you use to give bounds for this one.

1116
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,599
Okay, thanks for those questions

1117
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,599
everybody. That was helpful.

1118
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,370
[Applause]

1119
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,160
Okay.

1120
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:07,960
So now we're going to do a slightly more

1121
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:07,960
rigorous version of this argument.

1122
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,760
So rigorous proof.

1123
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,799
So the left hand side we decided was

1124
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:25,680
around 1 / m times the sum over the

1125
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:27,599
frequencies in qm

1126
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:31,440
of

1127
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,960
f fi of c norm squ. That part was

1128
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,200
rigorous before. We didn't need to make

1129
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,520
it rigorous. But now we need to relate

1130
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:41,440
this sum to an integral

1131
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:43,760
and we use this fact here. This fact

1132
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:48,839
encodes the idea that this quantity is

1133
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,839
locally constant at the scale 1 / n.

1134
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:59,839
So this is bounded by 1 / m

1135
01:07:54,079 --> 01:08:03,839
sum c and qm of the integral

1136
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:07,920
f^ 2 of um

1137
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:12,119
omega time cnhat

1138
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,119
of c minus omega.

1139
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,440
So this is just writing out the

1140
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:21,199
convolution as an integral.

1141
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:25,600
Now we can bring this sum inside.

1142
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:30,960
So this is 1 / m integral

1143
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:33,040
fi hat of omega^ 2 times the sum over c

1144
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,799
in qm

1145
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:41,239
of

1146
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:41,239
cn hat of c minus omega omega.

1147
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:50,000
Okay. And this sum we can bound by n.

1148
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:53,440
Why? Because each each term in the sum

1149
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,319
has size at least around n. This term is

1150
01:08:53,440 --> 01:09:00,159
a bump essentially a bump of height n

1151
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:02,400
and width 1 /n around c. And the

1152
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,640
distance between any two different is at

1153
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,359
least one overn. So those bumps don't

1154
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,199
overlap with each other.

1155
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,520
Now the bumps aren't quite compactly

1156
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:12,960
supported. They have the the tails that

1157
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,199
you can see in the picture, but the

1158
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,120
tails are incredibly tiny. And so if you

1159
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:19,040
just plug in the rapidly decaying bound,

1160
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:22,600
the tails don't contribute anything and

1161
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,600
you get this bound.

1162
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,480
Okay. Then if you take out this n, you

1163
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:37,440
have what we had before.

1164
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:39,199
n / m integral from 0 to 1 f^ 2 c

1165
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,839
uh

1166
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:46,000
n / m

1167
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:48,560
sum f of n squ

1168
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,560
and that's the proof of of linux Good

1169
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,560
stuff.

1170
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,560
So, we only have a little bit of time

1171
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,080
left, about five minutes. Um

1172
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,600
in

1173
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,719
e we could either if people have things

1174
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,199
you want to talk about we could just

1175
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,600
talk for five minutes

1176
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:44,800
or I could set up the next thing and try

1177
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,719
to try to give a feeling of how

1178
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,560
something in real real variable setting

1179
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,760
is analogous to this thing in a kind of

1180
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,760
number theoretic

1181
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,719
Okay. So, I I give a little try to give

1182
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:12,880
a little teaser preview foreshadowing of

1183
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:17,480
how the same idea occurs in real

1184
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,480
analysis. I want to keep this picture

1185
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,489
[Applause]

1186
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,040
Okay. So the the um the thing that we

1187
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,880
proved is if you have a function on the

1188
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:48,320
integers from one to n then when you

1189
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:51,040
project it mod p most of the projections

1190
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,520
look almost constant. They look smoother

1191
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,760
than the original function. And there's

1192
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,360
a totally analogous phenomenon in R to

1193
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,520
the D. If you have a function on R to

1194
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,840
the D and you consider projections onto

1195
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,920
lower dimensional subspaces, then almost

1196
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,840
all of them look smoother than the

1197
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,199
original function. And like we mentioned

1198
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,159
on the first day, if you're in high

1199
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:12,400
enough dimension, if you take a a

1200
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,320
function and you project it onto a

1201
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,239
typical line, even if the initial

1202
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,679
function is only in L2 and is nowhere

1203
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:21,920
continuous, the on a typical line, the

1204
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,320
projection will be continuous and even

1205
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,080
C1 and even C2, right? So the

1206
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,239
projections are much smoother than the

1207
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:31,840
original function.

1208
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:33,679
Okay, so uh here is a setup for this

1209
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:39,440
that's kind of analogous to the large

1210
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:42,159
sip. we have a function on R to the D

1211
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:45,960
and then we'll have V contained in R to

1212
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:45,960
the D which is a subspace.

1213
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:53,520
Um and if if you have a function so so

1214
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,159
pi V of F is the projection of F onto

1215
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,400
this plane. So that's a function from V

1216
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:59,400
to C.

1217
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:07,040
Okay. So now I have a remark that if you

1218
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:09,520
have any function of this vector space V

1219
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:13,520
then it's for a transform is also

1220
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:18,760
defined on the vector space V.

1221
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,760
Okay. And there's a dictionary lama.

1222
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,040
How is the 4A transform of the

1223
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:30,640
projection related to the 4A transform

1224
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:33,120
of the original function? And it says

1225
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:37,040
that um

1226
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:43,000
pi v of f hat

1227
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:43,000
uh is just fhat restricted to v.

1228
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,320
So this is a function on the vector

1229
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,600
space v. It's for a transform is

1230
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,080
supposed to be a function on the vector

1231
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:56,000
space v.

1232
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:58,000
fhat is a function on r to the d. But

1233
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,560
this for transform is just fhat

1234
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:08,440
restricted to that to v.

1235
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:08,440
Okay. So now make a picture. Um

1236
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,800
uh so here is r to the d and inside of

1237
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,320
there

1238
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,000
there's a space v1 and there's another

1239
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,840
space

1240
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,480
uh v2.

1241
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,640
Whoops. And okay. And I let you imagine

1242
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,159
other ones. They're all subspaces. So

1243
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,719
they all go through zero. Although my

1244
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:31,719
picture was not perfect.

1245
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,120
And I want you to imagine this as 4A

1246
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,120
space.

1247
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,840
So we have a function f. F is just an

1248
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,679
L2.

1249
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:49,040
Uh say it's an L2 function on the unit

1250
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:51,760
ball. So its 4A transform could be

1251
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:53,920
anywhere here.

1252
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,679
Um and all we know about it is say say

1253
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,679
we know the L2 norm of f. So we know the

1254
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:02,000
L2 norm of fhat could be anywhere. If

1255
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:05,440
you happen to put some L2 norm of fhat

1256
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
near zero then that will be part of the

1257
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:10,480
for transform of pi v for all the

1258
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,040
different v's.

1259
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:16,560
But if you put some of the l2 mass of

1260
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:19,840
fhat over here that will contribute to

1261
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:23,040
pi v1 but it won't contribute to most of

1262
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,040
the other pi vs.

1263
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:30,880
Um so therefore uh when you take a

1264
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:34,239
random projection the part of the for

1265
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:36,640
transform at low frequencies is uh kind

1266
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:38,960
of more highly represented and the part

1267
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,040
at high frequencies is less highly

1268
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,440
represented.

1269
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,520
So a typical projection so initially the

1270
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:48,320
for transform could have been anywhere

1271
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,719
but then a typical projection will now

1272
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,880
have its fora transform concentrated at

1273
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:55,880
low frequencies which makes it look

1274
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,880
smooth.

1275
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:59,679
Okay. So here's a statement like that

1276
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:02,560
that we will prove next time by the

1277
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,560
analogous reasoning.

1278
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,080
theorem.

1279
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:11,199
If f is an L2 function on R to the D

1280
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:15,239
supported in the unit ball

1281
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,239
and if D is big enough

1282
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:25,040
um then

1283
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:28,880
for almost every so then um if I take

1284
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:31,360
the average over theta in the d minus

1285
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:35,760
one sphere

1286
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:37,840
of um pi theta of f. So this means I

1287
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,640
take f and I project it onto the line in

1288
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,159
the theta direction.

1289
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:47,640
The ck norm of that is bounded by the L2

1290
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,640
norm of fition.

1291
01:16:53,740 --> 01:17:01,890
[Applause]

1292
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,040
Okay. And so the to so we'll prove that

1293
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:10,480
next time but to end I just wanted to

1294
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,520
have everyone look at the analogy

1295
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:16,239
between these two pictures. So in fora

1296
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:19,120
space when we project our function onto

1297
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:21,120
different um subspaces then that we have

1298
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,320
these different uh pieces of the fora

1299
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:26,480
transform that we're seeing and in for a

1300
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,400
space in the large civ when we take our

1301
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,000
function and we project it mod p for

1302
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,400
different p we have these different

1303
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,440
color pieces of the 4 a space that we're

1304
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,400
seeing and the different color pieces

1305
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:42,159
intersect at zero

1306
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,159
and they don't intersect anywhere

1307
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,920
or they don't intersect very much

1308
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,840
anywhere else.

1309
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,760
And that has the effect that when you

1310
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:53,280
take the projections, it emphasizes the

1311
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:56,159
zero frequency or the low frequency.

1312
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:57,440
And and that plays out slight in

1313
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:01,880
slightly different ways in the different

1314
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,880
settings, but but morally very similar.

1315
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,600
Okay, cool. So, let's stop there for

1316
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:17,760
today. I will hang out afterwards and

1317
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:21,800
office hour, make office hours talk. Um,

1318
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,800
and I will see you next week.
