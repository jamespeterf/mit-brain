1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,279
good morning good afternoon let's go

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,720
ahead and get started welcome to lecture

3
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,880
16 this is the last lecture worth of

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,039
material that we're covering before our

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,599
quiz all right let's talk about counting

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:30,199
this is lecture 16 on

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,680
Counting and where we left off last time

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,280
was I had just mentioned the generalized

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,480
product rule and we used the generalized

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,160
product rule to count the number of

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,719
permutations of a deck of comically

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,000
oversized playing

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,800
cards uh we had 52 cards and we decided

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
if we want to choose an order among all

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,960
these cards well we have 52 options for

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,399
the first card Queen of Diamonds this

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,879
time after that we have 51 options left

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,600
for the second card four of clubs this

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,960
time now we have 50 cards left 5050

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,439
options and

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,240
notice what whatever first two cards I

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,360
chose um

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,119
initially whatever cards I chose is

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,320
going to change the set of available

25
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,000
options left if I had instead of

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,400
choosing the queen of diamonds first if

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,200
I had

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,920
chosen the eight of clubs first then it

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,400
would be this 50 cards that are

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,479
remaining on step three rather than the

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,720
previous set um but still on step three

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,439
we always have 50 choices

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,360
left so now we're choosing the two of

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,240
hearts on step four we always have 49

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,280
choices left then 48 47

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,439
Etc um and so we were able to sum this

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
up into a general principle called the

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,079
generalized product rule which basically

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,840
says if you're making a sequence of

40
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:59,000
choices and at every um at the E choice

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,600
you always have a fixed number n i of

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,880
possible choices at that I

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,560
step then the number of ways to make all

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,319
your choices in sequence is just N1 * N2

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,239
* N3 all the way to

46
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,680
NK uh and that's what this says in text

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,160
so if a is a set of length K sequences

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,360
where there are exactly N1 possible

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,239
choices for the first one so 52 choices

50
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,519
for the first card and then N2 possible

51
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,160
choices at the Second Step no matter

52
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,480
what you chose for the first step then n

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,440
three um for the third step no matter

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,239
what your first two choices were and so

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,280
on all the way down then the size of

56
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,000
your set is just the product of the

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
number of choices you have in step one

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,480
times the number of choices you have in

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,959
step two etc

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,760
etc does that idea make sense let's do

61
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:53,239
one more example here um and this

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,400
example is about money money is a fun

63
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,879
topic right um so anyone who has a

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,840
dollar bill on them doesn't have to be a

65
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,519
one just any dollar bill go ahead and P

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
pull it out for a second and then give

67
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,640
it to me no you can keep it um but take

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,920
a look at the serial number so every

69
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,159
dollar bill has a serial

70
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:17,239
number which is a

71
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,239
length eight sequence of

72
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,400
digits how many possible serial numbers

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,519
are there there might be some letters in

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,840
there ignore the letters there are eight

75
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,000
digits how many possible serial digits

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,319
are serial numbers are there how many

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,640
ways are there to choose

78
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,239
a sequence of eight

79
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,159
digits

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,799
yes eight

81
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,000
factorial eight factorial

82
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:47,799
serials any other suggestions

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,560
yes 10 to the eth 10 to the eth any

84
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,560
other

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,560
suggestions

86
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,959
yes okay 10 * 9 * 8 all the way down to

87
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,640
three cuz we're only choosing eight

88
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,239
digits instead of choosing all 10

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,640
digits okay I'm going to put another

90
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,640
suggestion in there 8 to the

91
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,959
10 so which of these is

92
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,280
right so importantly I never said that

93
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,440
the digits had to be distinct and in

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,639
fact very often they're not

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,720
distinct so if we choose so here 2 3

96
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
four five six 7even here are the eight

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,039
digits we're going to choose a number

98
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,600
for each like if I choose a seven for

99
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,840
our first digit

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,160
well I had 10 options

101
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,120
right how many options do I have for the

102
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,720
next

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,240
digit 10 right I'm allowed to choose

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,759
seven again if I want to so I have 10

105
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,360
options here maybe I do choose seven

106
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,440
again how many options

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,280
here still

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,000
10 maybe I choose a four this time and

109
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,120
so on I can fill this in every time I

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,639
have 10 options for my next digit so the

111
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:05,160
number of choices is 10 * 10 * 10 8 10

112
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,000
8 does that make sense cool this in fact

113
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,639
is just the regular product rule we

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,639
didn't need the generalized product rule

115
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,960
here because the set of choices I have

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,800
is just all 10 digits the set of choices

117
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,520
I have is the same all 10 digits um the

118
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,680
set of choices isn't changing as I make

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,360
more choices just ju just regular

120
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,960
product rule I put 8 to the 10 up there

121
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,160
just to be a bit of a troll um because 8

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,919
to the 10 and 10 to the 8 are easy to

123
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,720
get

124
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,560
confused um and so if you think about it

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,960
this way how many options do I have for

126
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,360
this choice for that choice for that

127
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,759
choice it'll be easy to tell which one

128
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,560
of these is right and which one of them

129
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,440
is

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,759
wrong uh so 10 to the8 serial

131
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,960
numbers but we had um some of these

132
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,520
formulas were sounding like we wanted

133
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,039
the digits to be distinct they're not

134
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,440
always but maybe sometimes they are so

135
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,639
everyone who pulled out a dollar bill uh

136
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,479
can you check your serial number and if

137
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,840
all of your digits are distinct can you

138
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,840
raise your

139
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,639
hand no

140
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,479
one can you raise your hand if you

141
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,680
checked a dollar bill and it

142
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:25,240
failed okay so I'm seeing about like 20

143
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,080
25 people that carry cash uh so out of

144
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,080
those $25 bills none of them had all

145
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,680
distinct

146
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,199
digits um which is a shame because if

147
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,840
someone did have all distinct digits I

148
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,479
brought Candy so maybe check the other

149
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,560
dollars in your

150
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,759
wallet um but this gives us a natural

151
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,759
counting question how

152
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
many

153
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,639
serials have

154
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,080
all

155
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,280
distinct

156
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,879
digits and let's see if we can count

157
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,160
this using the product rule or maybe the

158
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:08,199
generalized product rule um once again 1

159
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,560
2 3 4 5 six 7even eight I like to think

160
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,560
about my choices in order one at a time

161
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,800
so I just draw a little bar to remind

162
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,879
myself I'm going to choose something

163
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,199
here and remind myself how many options

164
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,840
I had so let's see if we can construct

165
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,639
serial numbers that have all distinct

166
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,639
digits length eight how many options do

167
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,160
I have for my first

168
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,120
digit 10 absolutely I have 10 options

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,479
here maybe this time I chose a

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,759
three how many options do I have for the

171
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,960
second

172
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:42,360
digit nine is it always nine what if

173
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,919
this digit had been eight still nine

174
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,520
right no matter what I did here there's

175
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,720
always nine options left so maybe I

176
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,599
choose a seven how many options here

177
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,400
eight I've used two I'm not allowed to

178
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:59,960
reuse them so there are eight options

179
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,680
left then seven then six then five

180
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,240
then four then

181
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:11,479
three and therefore by the generalized

182
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:15,240
product rule by the generalized product

183
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,440
rule um the number of length eight

184
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:24,000
serial numbers with all distinct

185
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:26,440
digits is 10 * 9 * 8 all the way down to

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,280
three just the product of the number of

187
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,319
choices I have at each step which by the

188
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,039
way someone had had guessed previously

189
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,279
so well done with

190
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,760
that um and now you could ask out of all

191
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,959
the serials out of all 10 to the8 serial

192
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,279
numbers now we know how many of them

193
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,000
have all distinct digits what fraction

194
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,760
is that well we just divide um this

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,320
number divided by 10 e um tells us there

196
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,160
are actually only about 1.8% of dollar

197
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,120
bills that have all distinct digits so

198
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,279
about less than 2% so since we had like

199
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,200
25 or $30 bills that we checked

200
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,160
collectively it's it's no surprise that

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,880
we didn't get any of them uh that fit

202
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,360
this this

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,440
Criterion um if more people carried cash

204
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,399
maybe we'd be seeing some some candy

205
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,680
payouts today

206
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,720
shame um questions about the generalized

207
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,480
product

208
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,839
rule wonderful let's move on to the next

209
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,839
rule which is the division rule

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,079
wonderful um so so far we've seen the

211
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,079
bje

212
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,760
rule so if F from a set a to a set B is

213
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,760
a

214
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,480
bje then the size of a equals the size

215
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,560
of

216
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,920
b um a bje by the way is also called a

217
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,920
one:1 correspondence one two

218
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,160
one

219
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,320
correspondence um where the picture in

220
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,399
your head should be that every one thing

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,640
on the left corresponds to one thing on

222
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,720
the right they're paired up one to one

223
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,560
um thinking of this function in our

224
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,800
directed arrow drawing fashion

225
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,279
everything from a has exactly one Arrow

226
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,720
out and everything in B has exactly one

227
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,519
arrow in that's what it means to be a

228
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,560
bje so it's a one to one correspondence

229
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,120
one Arrow out one arrow in let's we can

230
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,279
generalize this a little

231
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,720
bit

232
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,720
so um if

233
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,720
instead every a in

234
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,519
a has

235
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,519
exactly one Arrow

236
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,279
out and every B and B

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,279
has

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,240
exactly K arrows

239
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:17,600
in then we can conclude that the size of

240
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,600
a divid k equals the size of

241
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,720
B so here's my

242
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,000
picture everything on the left has one

243
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,079
out everything on the right has two

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,120
arrows in exactly two arrows in every

245
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,839
time then there are double as many

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,839
elements on the left as there are on the

247
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,079
right if it were three arrows

248
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,600
in if everything on the right has

249
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,440
exactly three arrows in then there are

250
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,760
three times as many things on the left

251
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,600
as there are on the

252
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,519
right so this is a generalization of a

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,839
bje or a one:1 correspondence uh to

254
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,839
what's called a k to1 correspondence

255
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,040
because what this ends up doing is

256
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,079
saying that we've divided the left side

257
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,519
into groups of size K that correspond to

258
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:19,000
each one thing on the right so this one

259
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:21,680
thing on the right matches one two three

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,959
things on the left and everything on the

261
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,440
right is paired with three distinct

262
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,959
things on the

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,639
left and so this is a useful tool for

264
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,800
counting that generalizes the projection

265
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,839
rule we don't have to match up match

266
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,519
things up one to one as long as we know

267
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,360
that we're matching the same number of

268
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,839
things every time and then we just

269
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,720
divide by that

270
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,720
thing all right let's put this to

271
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,360
use okay so

272
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,760
example Knights of the Round

273
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,800
Table so the set here is we're going to

274
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,800
have n

275
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,920
Knights maybe it should have been K

276
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,120
Knights n Knights all sitting around a

277
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,959
round table

278
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,959
um around a round

279
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,720
table at n equally spaced

280
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,120
seats how many different

281
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,600
arrangements are

282
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,120
possible if

283
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,440
rotations of a seating

284
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,399
assignment are

285
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
considered equivalent

286
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,639
so n Knights sitting around a table if

287
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,160
you have one seating assignment and you

288
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
have a second seating assignment that's

289
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,079
just a rotation of the first then we

290
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,399
want to consider those two assignments

291
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,399
the same seating assignment we don't

292
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,199
care which exact seats they're in as

293
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,560
long as the cyclic order around the

294
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,600
circle is the same so for example if n

295
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,639
is four and we

296
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,240
have um like one here then three here

297
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,279
then four here and two here that's one

298
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,519
possible seating

299
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,440
assignment well here's a different one

300
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,160
one here three here four here two

301
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,160
here but this assignment is the same as

302
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,160
that assignment because we've just

303
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,839
rotated the table and we're just saying

304
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,279
we don't care about rotating the table

305
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,320
so in fact we want to consider these to

306
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:50,440
be equivalent seating

307
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,839
assignments right just like we want to

308
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,639
consider this to be equivalent to one

309
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,240
then three then four then two this way

310
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,480
and equivalent to one then three then

311
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,040
four then two this way so all four of

312
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,880
these rotated seating assignments are

313
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,639
equivalent because it's the same order

314
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,839
they're just starting in a different

315
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,639
place does that make

316
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,240
sense cool so that's our question how

317
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,720
many different seating arrangements for

318
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,160
these end nights are possible given that

319
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,800
we don't care about

320
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,680
rotations and to solve it let's see if

321
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,360
we can use a k to1 map because that's

322
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,279
what we're trying to learn at this point

323
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,839
in this lecture

324
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:39,000
um so here is the map I'm going to

325
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:42,279
recommend um let's let's let a be the

326
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,279
set of

327
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:48,920
permutations of one through n

328
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,160
permutation just means a reordering so

329
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,720
it's all of the

330
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,480
orders of the set 1 through

331
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,480
n and

332
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,920
B is the set

333
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,920
of cyclic

334
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,880
seating arrangements so B is the thing

335
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,920
we're trying to

336
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,279
count how many different seating

337
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,240
arrangements are

338
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,160
possible well a we know how to count

339
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,160
what's the size of

340
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,839
a what is it n

341
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,399
factorial that's exactly right um that

342
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,720
was our first example of generalized

343
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,399
product rule on Tuesday there're 52

344
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,720
factorial orders for a deck of cards

345
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,959
they're n factorial orders for a set of

346
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,040
n

347
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,839
nights all right so if we want to use

348
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,639
the division rule we have a set a where

349
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,360
we know the size and we need to be able

350
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,560
to define a function from a to the set B

351
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,920
that we care about and make sure that

352
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,639
it's a k to1 map for some

353
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,279
K and here's the map we're going to do

354
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:05,279
so f is going to take in a permutation

355
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,279
so an element of a so A1 A2 up to a

356
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,120
n so it takes in a

357
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,720
permutation an element of a and it needs

358
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,280
to spit out an element of B so it needs

359
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,000
to spit out a cyclic ordering of these

360
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,400
numbers and it's going to spit out this

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
cyclic

362
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,160
ordering that just sits them in that

363
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,600
order around the

364
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,840
table Yeah the the most straightforward

365
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,840
thing I can think of to do here

366
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,600
now that we have this

367
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,440
function let's check if it's a k to1

368
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,640
map

369
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,080
um all

370
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,400
right so what does it mean for f to be a

371
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:54,320
k to1 map is f a K2

372
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:57,919
one map well it means that everything in

373
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,640
B needs to come from exactly K elements

374
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,520
of a

375
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,520
so we

376
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,799
want

377
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,799
every cyclic

378
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,720
order comes from

379
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,360
exactly

380
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,720
K

381
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,640
permutations and when we say comes from

382
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,120
we mean via this function

383
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,640
f via function

384
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,720
f so as an ex example maybe n is five

385
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,880
this time and we have the order 4 5 2 3

386
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,919
1 some cyclic order

387
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,400
here how many different permutations of

388
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,159
1 through five maap to this cyclic

389
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,159
ordering who can give me one of

390
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,799
them so we have this this function f

391
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,440
that takes a permutation of 1 through n

392
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,159
and just lays it out around the circle

393
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,400
so who can give me a permutation that

394
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:05,480
becomes this once you lay it out around

395
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,039
the

396
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,320
circle I'll see if we can get some new

397
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,480
hands yes

398
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,280
please 1

399
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,320
14523 1 four five 2 3 if we lay that

400
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,559
around a circle we're going to get 1 4 5

401
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,440
2 3 looks good to me excellent who can

402
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,640
give me

403
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:30,679
another

404
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:32,640
yes 452 31 452 2 3 1 if we lay that

405
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,360
around a circle we're going to get 4 5 2

406
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,840
3 1 looks good to me same cyclic

407
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,159
ordering all we're doing is choosing a

408
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,760
starting point if we know what cyclic

409
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,400
ordering we're aiming for well we just

410
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,480
have to choose who we're going to start

411
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,840
with and then list the rest of them in

412
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,120
order around the circle and that's how

413
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,760
we can reconstruct all of the

414
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,720
permutations that map to the cyclic

415
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:59,520
order if we start with two then it's

416
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,360
going to look like 2 3 1 4 5 If instead

417
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,760
we start with three it's going to look

418
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,400
like 3 1 4 5

419
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,120
2 and the only one we haven't done yet

420
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,000
is starting with

421
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:17,760
five 5 2 3 1

422
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,320
4 5 2 314 and I claim that's all of

423
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,400
them so in this case for this particular

424
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,400
cyclic ordering there were five

425
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,240
permutations that map to

426
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,039
it

427
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,559
right in general

428
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,559
I claim uh for

429
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,679
each cyclic

430
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,280
ordering there exist

431
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,880
exactly n

432
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,880
permutations that map to

433
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,880
it um for the same reason we just saw

434
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,080
for this example the only additional

435
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,960
information we need to reconstruct all

436
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,240
of these permutations is which starting

437
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,600
point we're

438
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,320
choosing because

439
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,320
just need to

440
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,640
pick a starting

441
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,120
point all

442
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,799
right so every for every cyclic ordering

443
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,720
there exists exactly n permutations that

444
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,080
map to

445
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,520
it which is exactly the condition we

446
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,520
need for f to be an N to one

447
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,320
map

448
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,400
n21 map everything on the Right comes

449
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,720
from exactly N Things on the

450
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,919
left and what do we conclude now that we

451
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,919
know f is an N to one

452
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:59,440
map why are why are K to1 maps in

453
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,440
general helpful

454
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,840
yes yeah we can understand the size of b

455
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,840
k to1 maps are helpful because they let

456
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,120
us relate the size of a to the size of B

457
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,840
and in this example we know the size of

458
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,919
a we know it's an N to one map and

459
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,919
therefore we know the size of

460
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:31,559
B so the size of B is just the size of a

461
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,960
divid n cuz we decided it's an N to1 map

462
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:39,720
and therefore the size of B is n

463
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:43,200
factorial / n also known as n minus one

464
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,200
factorial does that make

465
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,240
sense cool I see some

466
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,960
nods I see some blank stairs again you

467
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,720
know that's that's fine ask questions

468
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,440
when you have

469
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,200
them

470
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,919
okay let's look at one more example of

471
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,799
the division rule

472
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,520
um I want to look at increasing serial

473
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,960
numbers again but this time just length

474
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,440
three let's make it easier on ourselves

475
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,120
uh so the number

476
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,720
of

477
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,720
Serial uh serial

478
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,440
numbers length

479
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:23,000
three and now I want to know how many of

480
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:27,559
them have all three digits that are in

481
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,559
um sorry one moment

482
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,159
sorry I got ahead of myself different

483
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,440
example still length three serial

484
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,840
numbers I just want to count these

485
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,640
that's all I want to do how many length

486
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,120
three serial numbers are there um with

487
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,120
distinct

488
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,600
digits and we already have one way that

489
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,159
we know to count this uh we had the

490
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,559
generalized product rule method that we

491
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,799
used for length eight we can do the the

492
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,440
same for length three I want to propose

493
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,960
a different method that uses the

494
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,919
division rule instead and here's what

495
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,679
I'm going to

496
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,760
do let's let P be the

497
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,279
set of

498
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,799
permutations of 1 through 10 uh sorry of

499
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,799
0 through

500
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:30,360
9 and let's let s be the set of length

501
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,360
three uh serials

502
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,039
with distinct

503
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
digits all

504
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,000
right and I just checked my notes again

505
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,360
I I got myself confused yet again

506
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,799
forgive me let me change the details of

507
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,240
the uh of the of the example just a

508
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,880
little bit um I want the number of

509
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,440
serials of length three

510
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,720
with not only distinct digits but

511
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
actually digits in increasing

512
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:17,159
order so I'm okay with two and four and

513
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:22,960
nine I'm okay with

514
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:26,159
01 3 012 is fine uh I'm not okay with 4

515
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,240
2 3 cuz four and two are in the wrong

516
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:32,840
order I'm not okay with two to

517
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,919
25 cuz I want strictly increasing so how

518
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,840
many length three serials have strictly

519
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,399
increasing

520
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,919
digits is the question

521
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:45,960
clear okay thank you

522
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,760
um and let's do the same thing we were

523
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,520
doing before uh let P be the set of

524
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,520
permutations of 1 through nine of 0

525
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,200
through N9 and let s be the set of ser

526
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,960
of length three serials with

527
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,480
increasing digits strictly increasing

528
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,399
digits

529
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,279
and let's see if we can relate p with s

530
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,440
in order to count the size of

531
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,559
s and here's what I'm going to do let's

532
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,960
define a function let's define a

533
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:16,960
function G from P to

534
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,760
S and it's going to look like this uh G

535
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:25,799
of a permutation a z A1

536
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:28,640
A2 up to A9 that's a generic element of

537
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:31,720
P that's going to go to the serial that

538
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,720
has a z A1

539
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
A2

540
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,279
sorted so take those three digits and

541
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,240
sort

542
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,919
them all right that's a way to turn a

543
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,360
permutation into a serial number with

544
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,360
increasing

545
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,120
digits by the way a different way to

546
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,960
think about this problem um you can

547
00:26:52,120 --> 00:27:00,080
think of s um s is equivalently

548
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:04,039
the set of uh size

549
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,039
three size three

550
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:11,399
subsets of zero through nine if we know

551
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:15,039
they have to come in increasing order

552
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:15,039
then all we care about is which three we

553
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,240
chose right so if I tell you my serial

554
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:23,520
has increasing order and has the digits

555
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,320
of five and four and

556
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,880
N then I know it has to be

557
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,520
459 so just the set of three digits that

558
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,240
we chose is enough to know which serial

559
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,799
it

560
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,880
is so if we want to think about this as

561
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:39,120
instead the set of size three

562
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,919
subsets then this function G would look

563
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,440
like

564
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,440
this would just go to the set a z A1

565
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,640
A2 so this is a way to map permutations

566
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,279
of of the digits 0 through 9 to subsets

567
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,760
of size

568
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:59,519
three all right and now let's see if

569
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,240
this G is a helpful function let's see

570
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:06,159
if it's K to one for some

571
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,919
K okay so the question becomes for every

572
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,600
size 3 subset of the digits how many

573
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,799
permutations ma to

574
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,799
it for

575
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,440
example how many

576
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:25,080
[Music]

577
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,080
permutations map to Three 6

578
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,240
7 one permutation maps to to the set

579
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,919
that was one

580
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,960
suggestion anyone have different

581
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,960
suggestions is it more than

582
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,760
one in the

583
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:47,200
back three factorial okay um so we have

584
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,000
one we have three factorial any other

585
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:54,600
suggestions

586
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,600
yes 7 factorial times 3

587
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,679
factorial here I'm going to put a

588
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,279
question mark next to each of these

589
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,880
because they're there are guesses let's

590
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,519
see if we can figure out which one is

591
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,600
right okay so let's see how many

592
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,159
permutations map us to this set well we

593
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:13,200
need to pick some permutation 1 2 3 4 5

594
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:17,519
6 7 8 9 10 some permutation of the 10

595
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,519
digits what do we know about these three

596
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:24,360
digits our function says you take the

597
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,159
first three entries and you form them

598
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,519
into a set and that's the output

599
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,880
so if our output is going to be

600
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,120
367 then these first three entries have

601
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:42,240
to be 3 six and 7even in some

602
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:44,399
order yeah 3 six 7 in some

603
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,320
order I don't care which

604
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,760
order because I'm just going to take the

605
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,120
three of them and plop them into a set

606
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,080
and a set doesn't care what order they

607
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,960
are okay so I know that 3 six and 7 have

608
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,120
to be in have to be in some order at the

609
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,480
beginning of my permutation what about

610
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,240
the end of the permutation what do I

611
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,360
know about

612
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,360
this what constraints do I have on it

613
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,840
knowing that g of this permutation

614
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,399
equals this set

615
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,440
y right you can't have three six or

616
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:18,200
seven you have to have all the other

617
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,640
digits in some order but anything goes

618
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,440
yeah so it's the

619
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,279
other seven

620
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,720
digits in some order

621
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:32,600
this is exactly the set of

622
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,559
permutations um where G of that

623
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,360
permutation gives the set 367 so we have

624
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,039
to put 3 six and seven in some order at

625
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,080
the beginning put the other seven digits

626
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,399
in some order at the end and how many

627
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,039
ways are there to do that well this is

628
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:49,360
product rule it's 3 factorial here on

629
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:53,519
the left 7 factorial here on the right

630
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,679
so 3 factorial time 7 factorial is

631
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,000
indeed the number of permutations that

632
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,960
map to this set

633
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,880
was that specific to this set if I chose

634
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,000
a different set of three digits would I

635
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,000
get a different number of

636
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,039
pre-images like if I instead chose zero

637
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,080
and five and

638
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,399
eight well it would be it would be the

639
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,760
same constraint right I would have to

640
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:21,240
have 0 five and eight in some order here

641
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,360
and then the other seven digits in some

642
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,120
order here it's still going to be 3

643
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,919
factorial * 7

644
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,919
factorial so in fact

645
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:40,360
G is K to

646
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,360
1 where k equals 3 factorial time 7

647
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,320
factorial yeah because the the same

648
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:48,799
argument we did for this particular

649
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,799
example in fact works for every

650
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,720
example great and since K is since since

651
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:58,960
this map is K to 1 and we know K we can

652
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,840
compute the size of our various sets

653
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,080
on one hand we had permutations of 0

654
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,760
through 9 so that was 10

655
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,720
factorial we put it through a a k to1

656
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,600
map where K is this so 3 factorial * 7

657
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,639
factorial in the

658
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,559
denominator and this

659
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:18,559
equals the size of the set

660
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,679
s sound

661
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,440
good so we map from permutation

662
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,080
to the set of the first three elements

663
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,200
and we decided that every time we do

664
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,440
that there U we lose by a factor of 3

665
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,760
factorial * 7

666
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,279
factorial um and so this is the number

667
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,039
of size three

668
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,760
subsets of 10

669
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:52,320
objects this by the way is an extremely

670
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,360
useful formula um let me generalize this

671
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,840
so the

672
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,679
number

673
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,279
of

674
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,279
subsets of size

675
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,320
K from a set of size

676
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,679
n is well we can do the same kind of

677
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,799
argument here map permutations and

678
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:20,440
factorial of them where we take the

679
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:23,399
first K elements and turn them into a

680
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,519
set um and that reduces the number of

681
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,639
options we have by K factorial on the

682
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,840
left and N minus K factorial on the

683
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:33,519
right right the same way it did here so

684
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:39,080
this is n factorial

685
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:41,240
/ K factorial time n minus K

686
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,039
factorial this is a really useful

687
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,320
formula you're definitely going to want

688
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,639
it on your cheat sheet but in fact

689
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,919
hopefully by the time the quiz comes

690
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:50,760
around next week you'll be so used to

691
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,559
this formula and so sick of you I mean

692
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,600
you'll love it so much um that you

693
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,639
aren't you aren't going to need it on

694
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,440
your cheat sheet because you're going to

695
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:58,760
know

696
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,760
it um

697
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,600
and in fact we have a special notation

698
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,760
for

699
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,480
it we write it as n on the top K on the

700
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,079
bottom surrounded in

701
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,320
parentheses notice it's not a fraction

702
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,520
we're not dividing n by K so don't write

703
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,000
n divided by K in parentheses it's just

704
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,760
n on top K on the bottom parentheses on

705
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,320
the

706
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:27,480
sides and this is pronounced n choose

707
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,480
K so n choose K is written like this we

708
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,399
have a formula for it like this um and

709
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,040
it's pronounced n choose K because well

710
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,760
we're choosing K things out of a a

711
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,079
possible set of end

712
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,760
things and like I said really useful

713
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,280
formula if you're ordering pizza for

714
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,800
dinner there are 15 sides or sorry 15

715
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,440
toppings that you can choose from to put

716
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,079
on your pizza and you're supposed to

717
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,320
choose three of them for some special

718
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:59,640
promotion how many ways are there to do

719
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,640
that if we've got 15 toppings

720
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,560
we want to

721
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,119
choose three how many ways are there to

722
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,440
choose what your pizza is going to look

723
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,160
like we don't care about the order of

724
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,960
the toppings we just care about the set

725
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,520
of three toppings that you pick it's in

726
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:21,720
the name 15 choose

727
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:24,920
three 15 choose three also known as 15

728
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,640
factorial divided 3 factorial 12

729
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,880
factorial

730
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,839
yeah wonderful um if I need to select

731
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,800
four volunteers out of this class of

732
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:39,359
let's say 200 students um how many ways

733
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,839
are there to pick a a set of four

734
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:46,359
volunteers 200 choose

735
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,359
four if I flip a coin 100

736
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,599
times flip a coin 100

737
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,640
times how many resulting sequence

738
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:12,720
quences have 50 heads and 50

739
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,720
tails in some

740
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,680
order there are 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 100 times

741
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,079
number of options in total 2 to the 100

742
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,680
options how many of those results result

743
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,480
in exactly 50 heads and exactly 50 Tales

744
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,480
possibly you know

745
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,480
intermixed well if we remember from

746
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,240
Tuesday we had this

747
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:42,599
bijection between binary sequences and

748
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,000
subsets where we can turn a binary

749
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,319
sequence into a subset by just taking

750
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,720
all the ones and leaving out all the

751
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:52,240
zeros take the indices of all the

752
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,160
ones and you can do that here as well if

753
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:00,000
we're looking at length 100 binary

754
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:03,200
sequences with 50 ones and 50 zeros

755
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,680
where one is head and zero is tail so

756
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,760
number

757
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,280
of length

758
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,280
100 binary

759
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,680
sequences with 50 ones and 50

760
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,400
zeros from the bje we talked about on

761
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,640
Tuesday this is injection

762
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,480
with um

763
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,160
the number of size

764
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,160
50

765
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,200
subsets of one through

766
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,640
100 all we're all we're doing is

767
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,440
choosing 50 out of the 100 flips to be

768
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,079
ones to be heads and the rest are going

769
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:52,160
to be tals so we're choosing 50 out of

770
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,160
the 100 it's in the name 100 choose

771
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,280
50 that's the number of ways to flip a

772
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,920
coin a 100 times and get exactly 50

773
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:08,680
heads and 50 Tails did that make

774
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:12,760
sense wonderful interestingly um it's a

775
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:17,200
little wet sorry 100 choose 50 divided

776
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:20,079
by um what is it 2 to the 100 so the

777
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,200
ratio the fraction of all results that

778
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,079
have exactly 50 heads and 50 tals out of

779
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:29,200
the total number of results you can have

780
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,200
um turns out this is about 8%

781
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,520
which to me is a little counterintuitive

782
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,319
like 50/50 has got to be the most common

783
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,720
result it's right in the middle assuming

784
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:41,560
we have a fair coin um and yet it's not

785
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,880
actually all that

786
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,800
likely turns out we're pretty likely to

787
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,359
be very near

788
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,720
50% um but it's kind of hard to hit it

789
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,440
exactly if we doing a thousand flips

790
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,800
instead of 100 I think it's closer to

791
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,440
like 1% and it gets rarer and rarer as

792
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,839
you go but but now we have the tools to

793
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,680
count things like that questions about

794
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,680
this n choose

795
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,599
k um for reasons that we'll see next

796
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,200
week this n choose K is called a

797
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,200
binomial

798
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,040
coefficient so binomial coefficient is

799
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,400
the general name for these n choose K

800
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,640
terms um again we'll see why on on

801
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,160
Tuesday but if you see this term know

802
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,119
that that's what we're referring

803
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,520
to all

804
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,960
right

805
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,640
nice now the last technique I want to

806
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,000
talk about the last counting

807
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:50,079
technique um is extremely useful and

808
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,880
extremely uh versatile but that also

809
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,839
means that there are lots of ways to

810
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,319
apply it and also lots of ways to apply

811
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,560
it

812
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:00,960
incorrectly so let's talk about how to

813
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,520
do it and more importantly let's talk

814
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,839
about what we need to make sure of

815
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,319
before we know with confidence that we

816
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,319
can apply

817
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:14,520
[Applause]

818
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,240
it and in fact

819
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,119
conveniently it's built exactly on the

820
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,440
generalized product rule this next

821
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,599
technique that we're using in fact I'm

822
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,599
going to keep that up so we can look at

823
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:25,599
it

824
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,200
okay and this technique um the book

825
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,200
calls it

826
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,160
oops

827
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,160
counting with

828
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,720
sequences um or counting with

829
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,280
recipes excuse me the general idea is if

830
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,839
you have some set you're trying to

831
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,280
count well it would be really convenient

832
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:08,160
if you could sort of build up your set

833
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,000
build all the elements of your set via a

834
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,920
sequence of convenient

835
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,839
choices where you always have the same

836
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,680
number of choices every time um so then

837
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,560
you can use the generalized product rule

838
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,560
so counting with sequences or recipes is

839
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,480
just a way to construct your set with an

840
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,880
easily digestible sequence of simple

841
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,599
choices and as long as you ver ify that

842
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,599
that does indeed construct your set

843
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,280
exactly then you have your count with

844
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,800
the generalized product rule um this

845
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,160
will make a lot more sense when we start

846
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,079
applying it so let's start doing that

847
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,839
and the example we're going to use is

848
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,520
counting poker

849
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,200
hands um so we're going to use a

850
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,200
standard deck of

851
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:00,319
cards

852
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:04,480
um a standard deck of cards has um 13 of

853
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,480
what are called ranks and four suits um

854
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,359
so um I'm told that some of you in the

855
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,079
back can't see my comically oversized

856
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,079
playing cards um so let's do

857
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,839
better uh so we have four suits we have

858
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,000
Spades and hearts in my left hand we

859
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,440
have clubs and diamonds in my right hand

860
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,119
those are the four suits and then there

861
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,119
are 13

862
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,240
ranks no way this is going to work that

863
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:40,040
goes Ace to I I I'm not going to try to

864
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Fan them out sorry uh three four five 6

865
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:51,880
7 8 8 n 10 then Jack then Queen then

866
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:55,480
King those are the 13 different ranks um

867
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,240
sometimes in poker the ace is the lowest

868
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,440
of the numbers sometimes it's the

869
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,319
highest of the numbers we're not really

870
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,119
going to care about that so much um all

871
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,920
we need to know is that there are four

872
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:10,520
suits and 13 ranks and the deck consists

873
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,880
of every combination of one of each so

874
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,440
13 * 4 is 52

875
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,520
cards so 13

876
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,640
ranks four

877
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,920
suits these are called Hearts clubs

878
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,559
Spades and

879
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:30,559
diamonds um and there are 52 cards

880
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:33,200
corresponding to every way to choose one

881
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,200
rank and one

882
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,559
suit that is the standard uh deck of

883
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,800
cards we're going to be assuming that

884
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,319
for these next

885
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:49,160
examples come to me

886
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:50,640
notes um and in poker a poker hand is a

887
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,920
set of five

888
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,640
cards so a

889
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,640
poker

890
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:03,119
hand is a subset

891
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,000
of five cards out of the 52 possible

892
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,440
cards and some subsets have more

893
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,200
specialized properties they're less

894
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,839
common and so they're more powerful and

895
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,920
you you get to beat your enemies with

896
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:19,200
powerful hands um that's poker

897
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,720
right so let's see some different kinds

898
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,440
of poker hands and the first one I want

899
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,440
to look at is four of a

900
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,480
kind kind

901
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,800
so poker hand is called a four of a kind

902
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,920
if you have all four

903
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,800
cards of some

904
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,319
Rank and then some fifth

905
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,800
card so four of a kind because you have

906
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,280
all four options of the same

907
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,480
Rank and we want to count how many four

908
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,559
of a kind hands are there in a standard

909
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,559
52 deck 52 card deck all right and we're

910
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,119
going to do this

911
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:04,160
this by counting with a recipe

912
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,800
here and basically I kind of already

913
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,359
wrote The Recipe but let's do it

914
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:15,319
carefully um step one I'm going

915
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,800
to choose a rank

916
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:19,920
R and

917
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,319
take all four

918
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,319
cards of that

919
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,520
Rank and then I'm going to

920
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:34,240
pick one other

921
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,359
card and putting the these two steps

922
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,079
together we have now constructed a poker

923
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:44,160
hand a set of five

924
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,880
cards um and the claim is that this

925
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,680
recipe is going to help us count the set

926
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,680
of four of a kind

927
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,720
hands great we can be a little more

928
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,200
precise with this um what we've really

929
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,440
done

930
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,920
done excuse me um so first we've set up

931
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,280
a set I'm going to call it a is going to

932
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,280
be the set

933
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,640
of R and

934
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:16,079
C where R is a

935
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,079
rank C is a

936
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,960
card with rank not equal to

937
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,520
R so this is sort of following our

938
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,359
recipe we choose a rank for the four of

939
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,720
a kind and then we choose a fifth card

940
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:34,359
which can't be one of the four we've

941
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:36,440
already picked um and B is the set of

942
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:39,440
four of a

943
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,440
kind

944
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,960
hands we have the set a of pairs of

945
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,119
sequences this is where counting with

946
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,680
sequences comes

947
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,960
in but B is really the set we're trying

948
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,640
to

949
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,640
count and we've set up a map from A to B

950
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:10,240
we set up some function f from A to

951
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:14,000
B which takes a rank and some other card

952
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:18,160
and turns it into the hand rank of

953
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Hearts rank of diamonds rank of Spades

954
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,000
rank of clubs and then this other card

955
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,800
C does that make sense how this

956
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:32,520
description of a recipe turns into this

957
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,520
set this set and this map between

958
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,040
them wonderful no objections so I'll

959
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,040
continue um and now the

960
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:45,640
claim f is a

961
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,520
bje this is where counting with recipes

962
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,400
this is what the technique is we want to

963
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,960
construct some set of sequences where

964
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,119
we're making a sequence of choices in

965
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,559
order and we want to prove that the

966
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,400
resulting set is

967
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,720
injection with the set we're actually

968
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,400
trying to count and as long as we can

969
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,839
verify that bje then we know the size of

970
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,559
B because we know the size of a with

971
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:17,520
generalized product

972
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:19,240
rule so we need to verify f is a bje and

973
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,200
then we need to count the size of a in

974
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,440
order to figure out the size of B so

975
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,760
what does it mean for f to be a

976
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,760
bje well we need F to be

977
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,040
a

978
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,920
function

979
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,480
total

980
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,480
surjective and

981
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,680
injective okay so what does it mean for

982
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,200
f to be a function it means for every

983
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:54,240
input there's at most one output and

984
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,799
that's usually built into the process um

985
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,359
we have some deterministic way of

986
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:00,200
turning this pair into this hand and

987
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:02,760
there's not ambiguity this pair can't

988
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,920
turn into seven different hands usually

989
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,720
we get the function side for free and

990
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,040
it's not really worth commenting on much

991
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:14,000
what does total

992
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:16,839
mean total means that um every pair

993
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,359
turns into at least one hand and since

994
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:21,520
we know it's a function every pair turns

995
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:24,839
into exactly one hand specifically turns

996
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,880
into a hand in the set we care

997
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:28,119
about so we have our first first

998
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,040
meaningful

999
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:36,280
question um

1000
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:36,280
is f of r c a four of a

1001
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,240
kind for

1002
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,280
every way we have to fill out our recipe

1003
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,839
so is everything we construct are all of

1004
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,240
the hands that we construct really four

1005
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:55,640
of a kind hands or are we constructing

1006
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,160
some extraneous stuff if we're building

1007
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,599
extraneous stuff then we're not counting

1008
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,440
the right set cuz we're not building the

1009
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,480
right

1010
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,760
set so first meaningful question for

1011
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,160
every way we have to fill the recipe is

1012
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,240
the hand that we've

1013
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,480
constructed a hand that we're trying to

1014
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,200
count and in this case well we can see

1015
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,280
that yes yes it is because we have all

1016
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,599
four cards of the same

1017
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,319
rank um and we have a fifth card that is

1018
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,440
not any of these cards because it has

1019
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:27,359
rank that's different from R so this

1020
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,319
really is a size five sub set with four

1021
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:33,920
cards of the same rank so in this case

1022
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:37,079
yes

1023
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,880
great we need F to be

1024
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,359
subjective what does it mean to be

1025
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,280
subjective it means every four of a kind

1026
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:46,680
hand everything in B comes from

1027
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,400
something in

1028
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:52,119
a all

1029
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,119
right um can

1030
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,319
every four of

1031
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,559
aind hand

1032
00:50:57,319 --> 00:50:59,559
be

1033
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,280
built so can we really construct

1034
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,799
everything that we're trying to

1035
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,799
count uh in this

1036
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,680
example uh let's look at an example if I

1037
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,280
have the four of a kind hand that has a

1038
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:25,960
three of Hearts the seven of Hearts the

1039
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,559
three of diamonds the three of clubs and

1040
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,559
the three of SP

1041
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,319
es how do I build that from my recipe

1042
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,920
how do I get that as an output of my

1043
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:39,119
function

1044
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,119
f what is r and what is

1045
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,559
C

1046
00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:00,880
yep okay all right R is three and C is

1047
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,880
the seven of

1048
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,119
Hearts

1049
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,720
oops that's exactly right the rank R is

1050
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,079
supposed to tell us the rank that we

1051
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,799
have four of we have four threes so the

1052
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,920
rank is three the card C is supposed to

1053
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:17,480
be the fifth extraneous card in the hand

1054
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,240
that isn't part of the four of aind uh

1055
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,599
and that's the seven of hearts in this

1056
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:25,200
example was there any

1057
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:27,119
ambiguity um or sorry more importantly

1058
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,520
will we always be able to do this this

1059
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,319
for every four of a kind hand will we

1060
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:35,720
always be able to pick out a rank and

1061
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:36,880
pick out the fifth card yeah yeah so we

1062
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,680
are

1063
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,359
subjective we can build every hand that

1064
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:45,160
we care to

1065
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:47,960
build the last thing we need to

1066
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,760
check is our function

1067
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,319
injective all right and what it means

1068
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,680
for f to be

1069
00:52:52,319 --> 00:53:00,680
injective

1070
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:03,920
is can every for of a Kind

1071
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,920
hand be

1072
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:13,119
built in

1073
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:17,040
exactly one way exactly one way is what

1074
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,040
it means to be surjective and injective

1075
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,920
combined so for every four of a kind

1076
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,680
hand is there only one way to build it

1077
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,280
with our

1078
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,000
recipe and in this case yeah for for

1079
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,920
kind of the same reason we know which

1080
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,480
rank we have four of we know which card

1081
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,880
is the other card that is that doesn't

1082
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,880
match that Rank and there's only one way

1083
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,520
to do that in fact there's exactly one

1084
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,839
way to do that so we have built

1085
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,920
everything in our set exactly once with

1086
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:48,319
our

1087
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,280
recipe so in this case yes which means

1088
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,960
it is

1089
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:57,440
injective and now we've decided

1090
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,440
therefore f is a bje

1091
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:04,160
are we

1092
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,480
done wait what were we even trying to do

1093
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,400
oh yeah we were trying to count the

1094
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,559
number of for

1095
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,680
kinds okay we did one of the two

1096
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:16,319
important

1097
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:18,760
steps we showed that a is injection with

1098
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,280
B but now we need the actual number the

1099
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,440
actual size of B we need we need the

1100
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,280
count and if we want to count the size

1101
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,359
of B now we know it's enough to count

1102
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,359
the size of a

1103
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,520
so we can

1104
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,599
use this time the generalized product

1105
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:48,880
rule so size of a well remember we're

1106
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,160
choosing an r and we're choosing a

1107
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,400
c so how many options do we have for our

1108
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,400
rank r

1109
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,960
13 there are 13 ranks Ace through King

1110
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:03,599
we can choose any one of them

1111
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,200
freely how many options do we have for

1112
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,200
this last card C that doesn't have this

1113
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,240
rank

1114
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:16,920
MH 48 perfect there are 52 cards in the

1115
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,799
deck we've already chosen four of them

1116
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:25,359
of this rank there are 48 options left

1117
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,359
so by the generalized product rule

1118
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,960
the size of a is 133 *

1119
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,000
48 so that's the other thing our recipe

1120
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,720
needs to

1121
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,200
satisfy it needs to form a bje with the

1122
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,799
set we care about but it also needs to

1123
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,839
be easy to count with the generalized

1124
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,000
product

1125
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:53,720
rule and that's the strategy break down

1126
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,799
your set you can think of it as building

1127
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,559
up your set via a sequence of simple

1128
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:59,079
choices

1129
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:01,280
make sure it's a

1130
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:03,960
bje and then count it with generalized

1131
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,760
product rule let's do that again let's

1132
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:10,400
look at another example this time I want

1133
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,400
the number of

1134
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,119
hands with all four

1135
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,440
suits how many hands have all four

1136
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,640
suits these are useless in poker this

1137
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,480
this doesn't actually get you anything

1138
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,039
um unless it has some other coincidences

1139
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,440
as well but it's fun to count how many

1140
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:34,480
hands have all four suits and let's see

1141
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,319
if we can break this down into a recipe

1142
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,319
all right here's my

1143
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,000
recipe choose a heart

1144
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:50,839
card uh choose oh sorry my notes have

1145
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,119
choose a club card first then choose a

1146
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:53,119
heart

1147
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,240
card uh then choose a space

1148
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:06,200
card choose a diamond

1149
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,920
card and

1150
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,920
then choose a fifth

1151
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:15,559
card here's my recipe choose a a heart a

1152
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,960
card that has clubs a card that has

1153
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:18,640
hearts a card that has Spades a card

1154
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,400
that has diamonds and then whatever

1155
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,240
other card I want to fill the last

1156
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,760
spot and let's see if this is a valid

1157
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,520
recipe for this problem

1158
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,000
and we can boil that down we don't

1159
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,599
always have to think okay injective serg

1160
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,520
all that all that fun stuff we can boil

1161
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,799
it down into sort of these bullet points

1162
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:42,240
which we can even compress a little

1163
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:42,240
further um so first of

1164
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:46,039
all is every

1165
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:51,680
hand constructed using our

1166
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:58,119
recipe um actually in our set

1167
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,240
so does every hand we construct really

1168
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,400
have all four

1169
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,400
suits and

1170
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,039
finally um does

1171
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,160
sorry can every hand in our

1172
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:28,119
set be

1173
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,119
constructed in a

1174
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,480
exactly one

1175
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,400
way these are the two questions we need

1176
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:39,079
to ask can we build everything we care

1177
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,440
about

1178
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,640
and uh can we build everything we care

1179
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,640
about in exactly one

1180
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:51,039
way and if those two things are true

1181
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:53,920
then our map is a bje and our recipe is

1182
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,720
valid um but these are maybe easier to

1183
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,880
think about and remember than going

1184
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,280
through that bijection rigal just

1185
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,520
remember that it's a bijection

1186
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,839
underneath that's that's what we're

1187
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,000
doing that's what the Shepherds do they

1188
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,240
count with

1189
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,920
bijections um so let's answer these

1190
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,720
questions um is every hand constructed

1191
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,079
with this recipe actually a hand that

1192
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:19,079
has all four sets all four

1193
00:59:15,079 --> 00:59:20,599
suits yeah yeah absolutely these first

1194
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,680
four cards are always going to have all

1195
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:25,079
four suits and the fifth card doesn't

1196
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,960
really help or hurt us so the answer to

1197
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:31,039
this first question is yes yes yes it

1198
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,680
does can every hand in our set can every

1199
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:38,119
hand with all four suits be constructed

1200
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:40,480
via our recipe in in exactly one

1201
00:59:38,119 --> 00:59:43,520
way and let's look at an example for

1202
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,520
that examples are really

1203
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:57,599
helpful so here's my hand I'm going to

1204
00:59:54,119 --> 01:00:01,920
look at the six of

1205
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:07,079
diamonds the Queen of Hearts the Ace of

1206
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:09,400
Spades the two of clubs and the Jack of

1207
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:12,520
Spades let's say we're trying to build

1208
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:15,039
this particular hand using our

1209
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,480
recipe well what does it tell us to do

1210
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,880
first choose a club card all right I'm

1211
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,280
going to choose two of clubs then choose

1212
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,480
a heart card great I'm GNA choose um the

1213
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,760
Queen of

1214
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,920
Hearts then choose a spade card uh great

1215
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,440
Ace of

1216
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,200
Spades then choose a diamond card uh six

1217
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,680
of

1218
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:37,599
diamonds and then my last card whatever

1219
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,599
that is it's Jack of

1220
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:43,440
Spades so these are the choices I make

1221
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:46,119
in the five steps of my recipe I indeed

1222
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,119
have built this

1223
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:52,200
hand can I do that in exactly one way is

1224
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:56,359
there only one way to fill out this

1225
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,359
recipe in order to get this hand

1226
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,200
can someone find another

1227
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:09,000
yep yeah the ace and the Jack the two

1228
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,440
Spade cards those could have swapped

1229
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,680
places in step three when I was told to

1230
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,079
pick a spade card I could have picked

1231
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,480
the Jack instead and then the ace would

1232
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,359
be my fifth my fifth extraneous card at

1233
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,000
the

1234
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:24,599
end so there are in fact two different

1235
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,480
ways of filling out my recipe in order

1236
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:29,640
to get this particular hand

1237
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:32,280
so it's not a bje we have failed our

1238
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:35,400
second condition this recipe does not

1239
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:38,160
work with this

1240
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,960
method sometimes you can salvage it in

1241
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,680
this particular example you can salvage

1242
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:44,680
it it turns out um this map that we've

1243
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,520
constructed is two to one because there

1244
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,480
are always exactly two ways to fill out

1245
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:56,160
the

1246
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:59,000
recipe whichever card you have in the

1247
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,400
spot it can potentially swap places with

1248
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,319
its partner that has its same suit but

1249
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,520
there are always only two ways to do

1250
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:08,240
that so instead of constructing a

1251
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:11,520
baction we've constructed a two to one

1252
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,359
map which means we can still count the

1253
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,119
number of ways of filling out the recipe

1254
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:18,640
and then just divide it by

1255
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,839
two so let's do

1256
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,640
that um number of ways to fill out this

1257
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:26,640
recipe actually let's just do it right

1258
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,640
here

1259
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,279
how many ways are there to choose a card

1260
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,520
that has

1261
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:37,640
clubs just call it

1262
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:41,200
out how many Club cards are there in a

1263
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,160
deck 13 yeah I think I heard that let's

1264
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,920
pretend I

1265
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,520
did um how many heart cards are in a

1266
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:50,920
deck

1267
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:52,920
13 how many Spades 13 how many diamonds

1268
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:57,520
13 how many choices do I have for my

1269
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,960
last card 48 again

1270
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,200
I'm allowed to choose any card that

1271
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,640
isn't one of the four I've already

1272
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:07,160
picked which means the number of ways to

1273
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,559
fill out this recipe is 13 * 13 * 13 *

1274
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,920
13 *

1275
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:15,440
48 so our

1276
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:18,279
answer is 13 to 4 *

1277
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,599
48 divided by two because we decided it

1278
01:03:18,279 --> 01:03:24,079
was a 2: one

1279
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:26,799
map so this is the number of hands that

1280
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,920
have all four suits

1281
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,359
did that make

1282
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:34,000
sense this is a perfectly valid way to

1283
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:37,200
do this um this counting with sequences

1284
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,440
technique um generalizes very nicely to

1285
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:43,799
this K to1 mapping instead of uh one:

1286
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,480
one mapping a bje BS are maybe more

1287
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:48,000
elegant or easier to think about if you

1288
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,079
can make it but if it's if it's two to

1289
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,359
one instead that's great just divide by

1290
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:56,599
two um just so we can see some different

1291
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:59,559
strategies uh here is a way that we

1292
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:03,960
could have done that uh with a bje

1293
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:03,960
instead of needing a two to one map

1294
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:14,079
um so a different recipe is the

1295
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:18,400
following so

1296
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:21,400
first choose a suit

1297
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,400
s

1298
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:27,400
um that will have two cards

1299
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:32,920
so in in every hand that has all four

1300
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,920
suits there's always one suit that has

1301
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,960
two cards and the other three suits have

1302
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,240
one card so first we're going to choose

1303
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,920
which suit has two

1304
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:46,319
cards all

1305
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:54,440
right call the other three

1306
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:54,440
suits uh T1 T2 T3 in alphabetical order

1307
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,520
so once I've chosen which suit I'm going

1308
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:04,240
to single out for the pair I've just

1309
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,839
given names to the other three suits and

1310
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,960
it's in alphabetical order so there's no

1311
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:11,319
ambiguity there so now my four suits are

1312
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:15,720
s and T1 T2

1313
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:15,720
T3 all right next thing I'm going to

1314
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:25,640
do choose two

1315
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,640
cards um with suit s

1316
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:33,079
choose one

1317
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:35,559
card with suit T1 then choose one with

1318
01:05:33,079 --> 01:05:37,960
suit T2 then choose one with suit T3 and

1319
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:37,960
that's my

1320
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:44,480
recipe all

1321
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,160
right and it turns out that this really

1322
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,000
does give a bje this is a onetoone map

1323
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:52,400
between ways of filling out this recipe

1324
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and hands that have all four

1325
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,000
suits because that ambiguity of which of

1326
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,200
these two cards are we choosing first

1327
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,599
well we're not choosing them first we're

1328
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,920
choosing them

1329
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,799
together uh so we've gotten rid of that

1330
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,319
ambiguity by doing it in this way and

1331
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,400
let's see how many ways there are to

1332
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:11,160
fill out this recipe first we have to

1333
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,319
choose a suit s and there are four suits

1334
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,119
to choose

1335
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:16,240
from then we have to choose two cards

1336
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,680
with suit

1337
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:22,480
s and there are 13 choose

1338
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,760
two ways to do

1339
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:29,559
that now choose a card with suit T1 13

1340
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,520
ways with suit T2 13 ways with suit T3

1341
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:33,880
13

1342
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:38,000
ways and so the answer is four * 13

1343
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:40,760
choose two * 13 * 13 *

1344
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,240
13 which does look a little different

1345
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:45,400
from the answer we got up there but if

1346
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:49,960
you check they're actually the same

1347
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:52,319
answer does that make sense sound good

1348
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:56,359
wonderful one last example I want to

1349
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:56,359
look at how many hands

1350
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,520
how many hands have at

1351
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,520
least one

1352
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:08,559
pair so pair means same

1353
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:14,400
rank so how many hands have at least two

1354
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,400
cards of the same rank so at least two

1355
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,680
queens at least two sevens something

1356
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,279
like that maybe you have three or four

1357
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,640
Queens maybe you have two queens and two

1358
01:07:21,279 --> 01:07:25,079
sevens or three sevens all of that is

1359
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,480
fine as long as at least two of your

1360
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:29,279
cards have have the same

1361
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:33,920
rank all

1362
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:36,480
right and here is my proposed

1363
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,599
recipe

1364
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,880
okay choose a

1365
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:44,400
rank for the

1366
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:47,079
pair uh let's let's call it choose rank

1367
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,079
R for the

1368
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:52,279
pair choose two

1369
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:57,119
cards with rank r

1370
01:07:58,279 --> 01:08:01,039
choose three other

1371
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:08,319
cards here's a recipe to build up hands

1372
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:10,480
that have at least one pair we know they

1373
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,240
have a pair because here's the pair in

1374
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,520
step two everything we build has at

1375
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,920
least one pair and that's the first of

1376
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:21,159
our two important questions um does

1377
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,960
everything we build have our

1378
01:08:21,159 --> 01:08:27,480
property the answer in this case is

1379
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:30,640
yes does every thing we want to build

1380
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:34,000
come from our recipe in exactly one way

1381
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,000
is the other question we need to

1382
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:48,239
ask does every

1383
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:52,080
hand

1384
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,080
with at least one

1385
01:08:52,400 --> 01:09:00,839
pair come from

1386
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,839
recipe in exactly one

1387
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,440
way right this is the other question we

1388
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,880
need we need to ask usually this is the

1389
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,440
harder of the two questions because

1390
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,120
usually when trying to build our set

1391
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,839
we're building it in order to have the

1392
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:17,640
property we care about so that first of

1393
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:20,400
the two important questions is usually

1394
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:23,000
fine is this

1395
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:28,319
true um and let's let's look at an

1396
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,400
example here um so what if we want the

1397
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,400
hand Ace of

1398
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:37,000
Hearts Ace of

1399
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:39,319
Spades two of clubs two of diamonds

1400
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,319
three of

1401
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:47,000
Hearts how can I get this hand with my

1402
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,000
recipe can someone give me

1403
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:51,359
away

1404
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,279
yep mhm

1405
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:04,199
okay let's choose our rank as

1406
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:07,040
a for our first step second step is two

1407
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:07,040
cards with rank

1408
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,480
Ace Ace of Hearts and Ace of Spades for

1409
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:15,080
our second

1410
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:17,400
step um and for our third step the other

1411
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:20,880
three cards in this case that's two of

1412
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,520
clubs two of diamonds three of Hearts

1413
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,840
this is a way to fill out our recipe in

1414
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:27,320
order to get that hand who can give me

1415
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,320
another way

1416
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:34,600
yep all right rank equals

1417
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:45,000
two all right um then then the two cards

1418
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,600
of rank two we're going to pick are

1419
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,719
going to be two of clubs and two of

1420
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,400
diamonds and then the last step of our

1421
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:54,480
recipe is choose the other three cards

1422
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,480
which in this case are Ace of Hearts Ace

1423
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,120
of Spades and three of

1424
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,280
Hearts so we found two different ways of

1425
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,920
filling out our recipe to get this

1426
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:08,840
hand so we've already broken our second

1427
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:11,080
question um this this answer is

1428
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,480
no but we've already seen a possible

1429
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,960
backup if it's always two:

1430
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,960
one then we're fine then we just divide

1431
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,640
by two and get our

1432
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:23,719
answer but let's look at a different

1433
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:27,360
example uh what if our hand is

1434
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:29,640
instead Ace of Heart Hearts Ace of

1435
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:34,400
Diamonds Ace of

1436
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:34,400
clubs three of clubs five of

1437
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,920
Spades a recipe really breaks down into

1438
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:41,480
two phases first pick a pair and then

1439
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,800
pick the other three

1440
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,560
cards right pick the rank for a pair

1441
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,000
then the sorry pick a suit for the pair

1442
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,159
then the ranks for the pair really pick

1443
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,960
a pair and then pick the other three

1444
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:54,360
cards is what our recipe says well there

1445
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:57,239
are lots of ways to do that for this

1446
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:59,639
hand we could pick this pair for our

1447
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:01,120
first two steps of the recipe and then

1448
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:05,560
choose the other three

1449
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:07,960
cards or we could pick that pair and

1450
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:10,440
then choose the other three cards or we

1451
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,800
could pick that pair and then choose the

1452
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:15,920
other three

1453
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,920
cards so this one had two

1454
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,960
ways this hand has three

1455
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:29,320
ways here's another example

1456
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:32,840
Ace of Diamonds oops Ace of clubs three

1457
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,719
of clubs and then three of Spades same

1458
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,280
example as before but now these are both

1459
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:41,520
threes instead of a three and five How

1460
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:44,920
many pairs are there now 1 2 3 four

1461
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:47,199
different pairs so there are four ways

1462
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:50,199
to build this with our

1463
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:53,880
recipe let's keep going what if we have

1464
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:58,120
a four of a kind we have all four

1465
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:01,239
aces on and then we have the Queen of

1466
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:05,280
Diamonds uh so that was clubs hearts

1467
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:08,400
spades diamonds now there are 1 two

1468
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,159
three four five six different pairs so

1469
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:14,800
there are six different

1470
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,800
ways to construct this hand with our

1471
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:21,800
recipe did all of these examples make

1472
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:25,600
sense cool and what we've learned here

1473
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:28,080
is that this recipe is utter garbage

1474
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,840
this recipe does not help it doesn't

1475
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:32,360
make a bje because there are multiple

1476
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,880
ways to build this hand it doesn't make

1477
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,440
a k to1 mapping because there a

1478
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,719
different number of ways depending on

1479
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,760
which hand we're trying to build so we

1480
01:13:37,719 --> 01:13:44,239
can't just count this and then divide by

1481
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:44,239
two or divide by three um

1482
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:51,920
question yeah uh so with with this

1483
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:54,440
hand um steps one and two really say

1484
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,960
pick a pair and then step three says

1485
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,239
pick the other three cards well how many

1486
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:02,880
pairs can we pick in this hand there

1487
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:06,560
are four choose two ways to pick two of

1488
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:09,600
the aces 4 CH two is

1489
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:14,840
six um or we can just look at it it's

1490
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:16,400
one two 3 um four five six those are all

1491
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:20,639
the

1492
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:23,000
pairs yeah good question so this

1493
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:24,360
recipe does not help I don't care how

1494
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,360
many ways there are to fill out this

1495
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,239
recipe I don't care how easy it is to

1496
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:30,360
count with generalized product rule the

1497
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:33,280
thing it's counting is not at all

1498
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,679
related to the problem we care about so

1499
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,280
this is the thing you need to watch out

1500
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:40,280
for and that's why these two

1501
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,880
questions are the things you should ask

1502
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:46,360
yourself about every recipe you see can

1503
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,040
you build everything you care about and

1504
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,480
is everything you care about built in

1505
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,000
exactly one

1506
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,679
way and it it takes some practice and

1507
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,199
some skill and some patience to figure

1508
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:59,120
out the right recipe in order to satisfy

1509
01:14:56,199 --> 01:15:03,080
both of these constraints and to work

1510
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:04,920
out any of the ambiguities that we see

1511
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,239
in an example like

1512
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:10,719
this all right that's everything I have

1513
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:10,719
thank you so much
