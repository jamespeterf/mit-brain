1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,960
so now I'd like to introduce our second

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,599
speaker Professor admir mesich admir is

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,520
Professor of civil and environmental

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,600
engineering and principal investigator

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,439
in the concrete sustainability Hub at

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,359
MIT adm's research focuses on the

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,400
science enabled engineering of

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,760
sustainable construction materials for

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,240
large scale infrastructure Innovation

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
and today admir will be speaking about

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,600
multifunctional concrete and as a quick

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,640
reminder if you do have questions for

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,640
admir during his talk please do pull up

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,480
the Q&A panel type those in there and

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,800
we'll get to them as best as we can at

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,640
the end of the talk so admir welcome

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,039
thank you so much for being here stage

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,199
is all

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,000
yours thank you very much for the kind

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:54,920
introduction and uh thank you for the

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,920
opportunity to uh share some of the work

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,519
uh we have been doing in my lab CS Hub

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,360
concrete sustainability Hub and the

24
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:10,720
newly established MIT EC Cube Hub so uh

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,560
today uh I would like to uh tackle a

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,280
couple of challenges that our society is

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,720
facing in the near future uh one of

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,200
those is energy storage uh uh uh

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,600
Challenge and U um mainly the the uh

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,600
issue of uh moving from uh uh

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,960
nonrenewable energy uh infrastructure to

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,720
renewable energy uh sources

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,159
infrastructure and the challenge is the

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,960
following if we want to match the

35
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:46,240
demand uh for energy that during you

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,280
know 24 hours is going uh to increase

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,439
during the day but then reach a Peak at

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,799
about 800 PM in the night if we want to

39
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,360
match this demand we just burn more coal

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,240
oil or gas and uh we meet

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,240
uh needs uh very easily uh with

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,719
non-renewable uh energy sources

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,720
nevertheless if we want to move to

44
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,760
renewable energy then uh you know we

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,720
think about solar wind and tidal for

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,000
example sources then during the day yes

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,920
we can satisfy the demand but in the 800

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,120
PM night we we really cannot use solar

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,519
panels wind is kind of intermittent and

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,519
and tidal is oscill and so so the pace

51
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,720
of the transition from fossil fuel based

52
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,760
economy to a renewable energy economy

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,480
will strongly depend on the availability

54
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,720
of bulk energy storage solutions to meet

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,280
these uh demands so if we think about a

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,959
a Solutions of course batteries are uh

57
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,400
uh could be a solution nevertheless

58
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,159
there is a a big problem associated with

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,040
batteries minerals for batteries are

60
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:01,480
Skyes and you see here I plot the

61
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,840
availability of uh uh you you know uh

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,799
lithium uh uh from Continental brins

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,720
from silicate ores or other sources and

64
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,080
you see there are only few countries

65
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,840
that can supply us with this precious

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,560
metal but we need to scale energy

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,159
storage we need uh storage solutions

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,360
that are available everywhere and which

69
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:27,640
everyone can uh use now I want to uh

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,519
talk about concrete that is close to my

71
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,840
heart uh of course and it's close to my

72
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,640
high because it's strong durable

73
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,959
versatile you can make it in any form

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,519
and you see here example of 3D printing

75
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,680
of concrete and mortars you can really

76
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,159
it's very versatile but most important

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,680
is extremely inexpensive construction

78
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:53,079
material it's so inexpensive that uh uh

79
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,360
you know uh if we plot the compressive

80
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,319
strength uh and the price in this Ashby

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:04,599
plot uh the concrete occupies the space

82
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:09,000
of see 10 cents per kilogram uh which

83
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:11,480
space very difficult to uh me access

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,879
with any other available material

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,519
including wood ceramis glass polymers

86
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,600
Composites or Metals so so that's uh

87
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,880
something important about the concrete

88
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,880
another uh uh uh aspect of of concrete

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,280
is that demand is increasing constantly

90
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,600
and that's the second challenge we are

91
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,320
uh uh uh you know facing a challenge of

92
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,160
uh population on the planet Earth by

93
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,120
20150 un is predicting to have a 10

94
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,919
billion people on our planet and out of

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,520
these 10 billion

96
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,520
6.7 billion people will live in the

97
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,320
cities and that translates into a need

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,400
to build cities and need for

99
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,880
materials uh so we are talking about

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,680
13,000 buildings every day uh uh needed

101
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,320
to support that migration from rural

102
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,520
areas to urban areas and that will

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,120
require materials and materials uh uh

104
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,680
that build our cities are you know uh

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,080
cement steel and polymers we just

106
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,600
learned a a beautiful talk before me

107
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,680
about polymers but but you see uh uh

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:30,639
concrete is the most produced material

109
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,560
on planet Earth uh uh it uh uh uh is

110
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,919
made out of cement and if we look at

111
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,000
this graph of production of cement we

112
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:44,440
talk about four billion metric tons of

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,199
cement per uh um per year and uh uh if

114
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,360
you then translate the uh the the amount

115
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:55,919
of CO2 emitted during this production

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,199
which is about 89 ton per uh ton of

117
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,960
cement produced then it turns concrete

118
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,199
and cement me into a problem 8% of

119
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,199
global CO2 emissions can be Associated

120
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,560
only with this material concrete and of

121
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,599
course if we now talk about a carbon

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,319
tax and and you know for each of these

123
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:25,360
tons we have a uh uh we have to uh pay

124
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,880
taxes then the uh the price uh uh point

125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,039
that uh is advantage of this material

126
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,479
becomes questionable and and so we are

127
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,160
discussing the future is there a future

128
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,560
of of this concrete looks like that

129
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,440
there is no future if we don't transform

130
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,000
and disrupt the industry so uh Port

131
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,919
Association released in October 2021 the

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,360
industry is 2050 carbon neutrality road

133
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:55,120
map uh unfortunately uh uh in this road

134
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,199
map uh we know how to mitigate with only

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,080
50% of the emissions associated with

136
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,520
cement and everything else is a part of

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,280
exploration and research and what we

138
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,560
believe in in our lives that the that

139
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,160
the key uh uh way to make this material

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,720
carbon neutral if not carbon negative is

141
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,199
to introduce new functionalities into it

142
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,039
new functionalities that will

143
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,919
systematically reduce uh uh emissions

144
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,280
Associated uh with the production

145
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,919
through avoided emissions so we could

146
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,840
use less by Design but also improve

147
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:36,639
longevity maybe through self-healing uh

148
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,560
and uh use concrete as a carbon sink or

149
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,960
even use it as an energy storage device

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,639
and this is what I'm going to cover

151
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,120
today we capitalize on chemistry uh here

152
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,400
in my lab and I like to always mention

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,599
our colleague Henry vanam who in 2018

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,400
published this paper where he says that

155
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,360
concrete is a remarkably Rich deposit of

156
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,720
interesting and contemporary research

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,680
questions all contained in its

158
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,000
ambiguities granular or continuous

159
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,440
liquid or solid crystalline or glassy

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,440
smooth or rough porous Britt or ductile

161
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,080
material or process all those are

162
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,840
questions associated with this material

163
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,280
and we are really putting effort in

164
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,639
understanding this material from

165
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,720
molecular uh standpoint so let me talk

166
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,800
about one uh functionality that is

167
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,680
improved longevity uh uh American of

168
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,760
civil

169
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,479
engineers uh gave a grade to America's

170
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,000
infrastructure and the score is really

171
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,519
not great it's C minus and uh we really

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,680
need to come up with better materials

173
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:49,600
that perhaps self-heal end last longer

174
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,120
um so there are concretes around the

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,640
world and this is the example of of

176
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,720
Roman concrete that uh lasts lasted at

177
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,720
in quite good conditions for 2,000 years

178
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,519
instead of 500 years of power

179
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,519
infrastructure and so so we uh really

180
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,079
would like to understand what are the

181
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,920
origins of the this extreme long-term

182
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,040
durability of ancient Roman concrete and

183
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,360
and how we can translate these

184
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,440
properties into into mod but you see uh

185
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Romans uh made uh their concrete a

186
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,240
little bit different from what we are

187
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,160
doing so they combine volcanic ash with

188
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,800
lime uh and sand and Aggregates to then

189
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,720
and up with a a calcium Alum silicate

190
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,600
hydrate cache that is chemically similar

191
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,079
to what our modern

192
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,800
cement is but it's quite heterogeneous

193
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:49,600
so you see compared to our modern analog

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:54,040
we we have these uh uh inclusions of

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,120
lime that are not present in in modern

196
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,760
systems and and we uh asked the question

197
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,040
of how Relic lime CLA these inclusions

198
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,680
are formed in ancient samples but also

199
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,959
how can they be uh missing and could

200
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,160
they be the missing link for

201
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,480
self-healing picture and uh we

202
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,680
analyzed ancient uh materials and lime

203
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,120
classs and we found out that Relic lime

204
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,640
clust might serve as a long-term source

205
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,519
of reactive calcium which is really

206
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,720
important for selfhealing and uh we also

207
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,880
found out that they are formed because

208
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,000
the Romans probably hot mix their

209
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,320
mortars using quick lime calcium oxide

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
instead of uh processing lime quick

211
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,680
climb before introducing into the mortar

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
they added the quick climb directly you

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,959
see in this video directly into the into

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,240
the mix you you add a quick climb and

215
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:55,000
and here we go and and then this mortar

216
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,320
heats up you see and and you will see

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,279
temperatures that go up to 90 degre C

218
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:07,720
80° C uh with hotpots of maybe 200° C in

219
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:11,440
the in the mix uh maintaining leaving

220
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,600
these lime class isolated and uh

221
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,480
available for healing and this is what

222
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,399
we then demonstrated in the in the

223
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,279
modern analog here at the bottom where

224
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,839
line clouds that we uh managed to

225
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,399
incorporate into modern concrete then

226
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,360
reflect the morphology and the chemistry

227
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,079
of the Ancient Ancient ones so we of of

228
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,000
course tested these new uh designs uh

229
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,639
for selfhealing which is a typical test

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,360
you take these cylinders you break them

231
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,880
and and make a crack of standard

232
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,560
distance Dimension and then you let

233
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,680
water flow through and you get healing

234
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,200
that actually um uh in our sample

235
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,639
systematically healed uh uh whereas the

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,160
uh The Standard Concrete would never uh

237
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,440
never stop the water from flowing and

238
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:08,519
heal in the cracks we observed a filling

239
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:13,000
agent that was a cite showing that

240
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:15,880
indeed calcium rich uh um um components

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,199
eventually reacted and healed and we

242
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,920
published this work uh in 2023 and uh it

243
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,040
received a lot of media

244
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,639
coverage the good example is that this

245
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,839
article at the MIT news was the most

246
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,959
viewed article ever to appear on MIT

247
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:39,839
News website which was kind of uh

248
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:43,199
shocking to to to to us more importantly

249
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,880
uh we uh patented this uh uh these mixes

250
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:51,399
and eventually uh started a a startup

251
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,920
dmat um that Cory mentioned and and now

252
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,880
this technology is AA available uh ready

253
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,000
to use anywhere in the world it's

254
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,040
self-healing concrete Roman inspire

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,920
uh concrete that uh uh increases the

256
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,160
lifespan of 50% and uh uh

257
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,279
50% allows 50% cost reduction compared

258
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:19,320
to other self-healing Solutions uh to

259
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:22,480
addition to this also reduces the uh uh

260
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,880
um emissions associated with this mix by

261
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:30,720
75 kilogram so you can for example sell

262
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:36,560
these as a carbon credits if you want

263
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:39,480
good so dmat let me move on to the other

264
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,800
function that is electrical conductivity

265
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,920
and energy storage uh solution and here

266
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,120
you see we are talking about electron

267
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,759
conductivity but concrete is an great

268
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,279
material but insulator so uh you can

269
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,920
though make this material conducted by

270
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,279
introducing

271
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,920
particles in in it in our case we

272
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:04,800
introduced Nano carbon black particles

273
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,800
and created this carbon black cement

274
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,240
composite that indeed conducts

275
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,959
electricity uh uh it conducts

276
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,320
electricity to this Nano viring that

277
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:20,399
happens through the process of hydration

278
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,519
and liberation of pores for carbon black

279
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,839
to self assemble magically you know in

280
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,680
the in the poe structure leading to then

281
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:33,000
a a a continuous volumetric wire uh

282
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,920
Network maintaining though the load

283
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,160
bearing characteristics and now we have

284
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,800
this electron conducting carbon cement

285
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,440
based material or electron AC Cube or

286
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,759
also electron conducting carbon concrete

287
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:51,320
which uh uh yes gives you conductivity

288
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,279
so resistivity drops but the price is

289
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,279
still in the range of

290
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,000
inexpensive materials and uh allows a

291
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,360
lot of uh different app applications

292
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,759
which could be a free store resistance

293
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,320
self heating energy storage or even high

294
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:15,000
electron uh high power electromagnetic

295
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,120
impulses um um shielding so uh I will

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,560
just quickly touch two of these

297
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,600
applications that we find very exciting

298
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,399
uh one is self heating it's a standard

299
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,880
Jewel effect you apply a voltage to a

300
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,160
material it's like in your stove play

301
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,519
uh based on voltage temperature

302
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,759
increases and you see if you put 6% of

303
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,519
carbon black into your cement composite

304
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:46,880
and apply five uh volts potentially you

305
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:50,880
get 100 degre C temperature of your slab

306
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,440
and and we uh use this recently in this

307
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,160
demo in in saporo in Japan with our

308
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,480
Japanese colleagues at the AC Cube Hub

309
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,480
you see minus 3° C

310
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:09,199
uh there was a snow melting on these uh

311
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:11,360
on these uh snow melting walk sidewalks

312
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,720
for example and here is the national

313
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,880
television reporting on this there is a

314
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:20,560
nice part where uh where indeed um they

315
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,319
show the moment where the

316
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,639
snow is coming it's snowing you know and

317
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,480
and these um these SLS here you go they

318
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:34,319
are covered by snow but as soon as you

319
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:37,279
apply the potential see 24 Vols nicely

320
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:39,839
uh nicely melts quickly and 12 volts is

321
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,360
slower a little bit but still eventually

322
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:47,360
ends up U uh uh melting all the snow and

323
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,680
we are very excited to uh use this

324
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,560
technology in the real world in saporo

325
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,959
uh and uh let me uh finish with the

326
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,160
energy storage so here we are talking

327
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,079
about the uh uh the

328
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,640
energy transition and the current

329
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,520
battery technologies are difficult to

330
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,839
scale to the size we need for this

331
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,000
transition and and we need a bulk energy

332
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,839
storage and this could be a solution so

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,360
concrete batteries actually they are not

334
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,039
batteries they are super capacitors and

335
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,199
super capacitor is very similar to

336
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,720
battery it has two electrodes but

337
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,880
instead of using chemical energy uh uh

338
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,120
translating into electrical energy here

339
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,559
you have just electrolyte splitting and

340
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,840
charging is just a a separation of of

341
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,200
electrolyte ions uh and uh this is

342
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,120
possible in our material because the

343
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,600
carbons that we use have a high surface

344
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:51,960
area and and we can you see build little

345
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,200
uh units of super capacitor with a KCl

346
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,440
um electrolyte and and then you can

347
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:01,880
connect them in series one one and and

348
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:06,360
live this nice LED make 12

349
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,720
volts series or this is a 12 volt

350
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,320
mesoscale our EC Cub set per capacitor

351
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,679
and the important number here is this

352
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,799
number here 300 V hours per cubic meter

353
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:23,919
uh which is of course diluted uh you

354
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:26,679
know it's not super dense but it's a

355
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,480
good number because we can imagine to

356
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:32,360
use the 30 35

357
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,120
cubic meters of this material to satisfy

358
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:40,400
daily need uh of 10 kilow

359
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,200
hour uh per day for a household uh also

360
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,679
this paper received a lot of visibility

361
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,080
and even we got a a priz from National

362
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:53,720
Academy of Sciences in 2023 POI prize

363
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,039
finalist uh so now though uh the

364
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,400
question is how do we use this and and

365
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:01,880
this opens really a new uh uh space for

366
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
system design and you know

367
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,799
multifunctional concrete that uh maybe

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,039
it's going to be these bricks that will

369
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,039
you know store energy and we will use

370
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,559
them in the walls of our new houses or

371
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:18,000
we build foundations 33 cubic meters you

372
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,200
see of of our material will satisfy

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,320
daily need and so off grid home

374
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,080
foundations uh and walls as the

375
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,799
batteries is a is an exciting

376
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,200
perspective of course high end would be

377
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:35,120
be to allow transition from not electric

378
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,799
cars to electric cars by using our super

379
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,000
capacitor energy storage units

380
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,120
underneath roads that collect renewable

381
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
energy and then charge the cars through

382
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:48,000
induction and uh and yes we think that

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,080
concrete has a bright future it's a

384
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,360
multi-functional future uh renewable

385
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,000
energy storage early age CO2 secretion I

386
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,320
didn't have time to talk about this but

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,559
it's 15% of CO2 total emission can be

388
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,559
mineralized in concrete and enhanced

389
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:08,400
durability are ways to go for We Believe

390
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:10,559
for this material and and ancient Rome

391
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,559
experienced architectural Revolution

392
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,039
through Discovery and use of concrete uh

393
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,039
we may be on the verge of a new

394
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,960
breakthrough that could completely

395
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,679
revolutionize our perception of concrete

396
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,640
architecture and the overall built

397
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,120
environment and its multifunctional

398
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,200
concrete with this I would thank you for

399
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,799
uh your attention uh I want to

400
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,880
acknowledge

401
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:38,799
collaborators uh that are many here and

402
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,799
um I'm happy to take

403
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,840
questions admir thank you so much for a

404
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,880
really interesting talk I see we do have

405
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,400
some questions uh coming up in the Q&A

406
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,320
panel again if you have questions please

407
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,159
drop them in there this is from Larry

408
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,000
why hasn't fly ash based concrete moveed

409
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,720
forward demonstrated in 2005 that fly

410
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,039
ash is a on toone replacement for

411
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Portland cement it cures quicker and

412
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,520
stronger and of course deals with a

413
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:09,799
major environmental problem that's right

414
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:13,279
it is there uh it's um the problem is

415
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:16,320
that is in the part of my pie chart of

416
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:20,880
50% uh that we know how to deal

417
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:24,799
with so so flyash replaces the ordinary

418
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,440
Port but you always need to have 50% of

419
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,440
OPC in these

420
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,919
mixes uh it's you cannot push it Beyond

421
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:38,840
those numbers you have to have always

422
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:41,640
50% uh uh OPC and the and the other uh

423
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,559
uh you know replacement that then uh

424
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,880
plays the job do does the job you cannot

425
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,600
100% replace

426
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,840
it thanks adir okay let me um jump

427
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,919
around a little bit here too uh I see a

428
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:59,200
question from Yos how does lime cast

429
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,799
based self-healing concrete compare with

430
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,440
bacteria based self-healing Concrete in

431
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:05,679
terms of relative performance crack

432
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,039
healing efficiency cost and

433
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,600
scalability that's a great question so

434
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,679
imagine

435
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,120
bacteria uh uh in these self-healing

436
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,880
Solutions are dormant they uh are

437
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,960
activated where the crack goes through

438
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,400
uh they then basically uh uh start

439
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,760
producing calcium carbonate and and uh

440
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,919
deposit the crack you know deposit this

441
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,039
material in the cracks and heal and

442
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,120
stops the water so from the performance

443
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,679
standpoint they are very comparable

444
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,720
there is a main difference that uh

445
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,480
bacteria need to be fed uh to uh do the

446
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:51,200
job and that's the challenge that these

447
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,320
Technologies face uh uh and and this uh

448
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Roman

449
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,000
inspired calcium source is inorganic of

450
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,080
inorganic nature and therefore uh

451
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,720
doesn't need any sort of U um

452
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,799
food but they are very comparable in

453
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,240
terms of

454
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,720
performance interesting thanks adir so

455
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,799
I'll on that note excuse me and to blend

456
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,000
a couple of questions that I see here uh

457
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,919
from harri Pria and also from

458
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,840
Mike on the topic of Roman concrete how

459
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,640
does the strength of Roman concrete

460
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,039
compare to high strength concrete also

461
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,760
what would be the impact on the quantity

462
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,480
of lime used to produce regular versus

463
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,240
Roman concrete and then I think to

464
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,200
Mike's Point uh are there any downsides

465
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,279
to the Roman inspired concrete perfect

466
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,919
these are that's the reason why the

467
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,760
Roman concrete is not being used right

468
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,640
now and we stick to ordinary Portland

469
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,480
cement because mechanical performance of

470
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,960
ancient Roman recipe is not good like

471
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,480
it's 10 megap Pascal Max okay and this

472
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,320
this performance cannot compete with

473
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,480
with anything we use and cannot be used

474
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:09,240
for skycrapers uh you know uh in in New

475
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,159
York a beautiful high aspect ratio

476
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:17,039
skyscrapers where the concrete has to be

477
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:21,039
super ultra high performance uh uh but

478
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:24,840
the um important thing to say the Roman

479
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,840
inspired is not the Roman recipe is just

480
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,120
the self-healing component that is

481
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:33,200
introduced into a modern uh analog

482
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,840
maintaining performances and of course

483
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,799
you need to tune it and demat did a huge

484
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:43,320
work in tuning the proportions so that

485
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:46,399
we are still in the in the range of of

486
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,760
uh uh standards uh that are applied in

487
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:53,039
the in modern industry but maintaining

488
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,039
the the performance and demat is the

489
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,720
right place to go to ask all the details

490
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:02,080
how they manage to to do this and I

491
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:07,000
think they are doing a wonderful job uh

492
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:10,080
in in um in moving this Roman inspired

493
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,159
self-healing uh products into a space

494
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,720
that is available right now you can

495
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,120
right now go and uh and buy thead

496
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,559
additives that are going to make your

497
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,520
concrete

498
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,919
selfhealing uh here's another one from

499
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:29,120
Ariel how resilient is the conducting

500
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,600
concrete to seawater

501
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,480
we don't know that's a great question uh

502
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,640
it's it's something that we we are

503
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,640
actively working on uh this uh

504
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,600
conductive concrete composite is

505
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,679
something that is new uh and there are

506
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:51,600
many questions around this and the EC

507
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:55,520
Cube Hub uh is a newly formed industrial

508
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,559
Consortium uh um that uh will tackle all

509
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,960
these questions in next five years

510
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,279
another question from Nick who wants to

511
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,399
know will

512
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,480
self-healing concrete cause will

513
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:11,159
self-healing cause cause the expansion

514
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,880
of the total uh components over long

515
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,399
times no no because uh it's just gonna

516
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,720
fill the pores and

517
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:23,600
cracks understood okay uh another

518
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,559
question here too uh what is your TRL

519
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,440
technology Readiness level I believe for

520
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,039
electron conducting concrete what are

521
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,880
the constraints and challenges involved

522
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:37,440
in Manu manufacturing this products I

523
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:40,360
mean it's a new material on the so now

524
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,799
you see it's a material that we

525
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:47,279
understand fairly well but every

526
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:51,399
application will require a separate you

527
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:55,000
know piece of knowledge that uh will uh

528
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:57,880
need will be needed to then uh move into

529
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,399
the real world and for example for this

530
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,000
uh uh

531
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:06,200
self-heating uh slabs I showed that

532
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,919
there is not many bottlenecks apart

533
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,760
tuning the mix and M putting some

534
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:15,039
reinforcement because of thermal

535
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,919
expansion of of layers that uh they

536
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,919
undergo through from minus 3 degrees to

537
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:25,520
40° C uh 50° C that we apply with the

538
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,760
voltage so so that's I don't think there

539
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,919
there are limitations there uh uh to

540
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,200
move quickly into into real world uh of

541
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,200
course if you talk about uh you know

542
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,559
energy storage and and having these uh

543
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,960
35 cubic meters of material underneath

544
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:46,120
the house there is there is needed a lot

545
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,120
of uh design input and Engineering to

546
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,480
really come up with solutions that are

547
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,440
you know within standards that maintain

548
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,919
mechanical performance uh but still it's

549
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,559
for us the most important thing is that

550
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:05,159
it's scalable first so there are no

551
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,679
Metals in it it's just carbon black and

552
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,880
cement and concrete and the number that

553
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,360
came out about the charge density is in

554
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,919
the orders of magnitude of what we would

555
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,440
need maybe that number could have been

556
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,159
you know 100 cubic meters instead of 30

557
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,240
cubic meters that it's like a problem

558
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:30,919
and so so we we are very very positive

559
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,840
in uh in you know uh uh possibilities in

560
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:36,440
of translating this into the

561
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,159
