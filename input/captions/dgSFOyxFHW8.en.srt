1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
And uh our our last um speaker for this

2
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,199
session is Jonathan

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,160
>> Buunor.

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,439
I'm looking for a

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,119
>> slide changer. This one

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,679
>> is this the slide flipper?

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,760
>> Yes. Okay,

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
>> you got it.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,040
>> All right. Yeah. So, my my name is

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
Jonathan Municore. I'm a assistant

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
professor at Boston University School of

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,239
Public Health. And uh my my goal in the

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,680
next 10 minutes is to not only uh

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,079
convince you that a person from public

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,160
health belongs in the room, but also to

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
uh convince you that you all are

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,800
secretly um going to be public health

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,359
professionals. Um so uh where I wanted

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,079
to start was to look at this um process.

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,080
This is how like uh EPA other

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,360
environmental agencies um like help

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,400
public health environmental health

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,600
professionals look at um just hazards in

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,439
the world. Um we do a lot of very fancy

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
stuff but very often it breaks down into

26
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,680
these four basic steps which is to start

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
it start on the left to ask like is

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,640
there some kind of pollutant a stressor

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,240
something like that that people are

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,360
being exposed to that might cause a

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,720
problem could be you know air pollutant

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,360
uh water pollutant heat um a safety

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
issue um anything like anything that

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,200
could harm people should go in that box.

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,520
Um, next up is this dose response

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,159
assessment. Um, where this is really

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,680
just a process of asking like if there's

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,119
a certain amount of this thing in the

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
environment, what are the health

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,079
problems at different levels of

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,560
exposures? So like air high levels of

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,079
air pollution or worse than uh lower

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
levels of air pollution. Same goes for

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,040
water pollution um and that kind of

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,960
thing. The uh third step that goes in

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,360
parallel with that is this exposure

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,360
assessment step that asks um okay so we

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,439
know that there's a thing that is bad.

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,960
um how many people are exposed to it?

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,119
How long are they exposed to it? Are

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,120
there certain like um susceptible

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,040
windows or susceptible populations like

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,200
infants or um marginalized communities

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,200
that are um exposed to this? And then in

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,560
the end we have this fourth step called

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
risk characterization which um basically

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,879
just asks like how big of a deal is this

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,000
anyway? Um, so what I've done and do

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,599
occasionally is I put this uh flip these

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
these four steps to look like one of

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,800
these hazmat placards that you'll see on

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,160
um like the the trucks going down the

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,680
highway or whatever. Um and then um

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
again here's a simple versions. Is there

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
some is there something that might be

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,040
harmful? How harmful is it if you're

67
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
exposed? Uh how many people are exposed

68
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,879
to it? And how big of a deal is this

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,640
really? So four basic questions. Um now

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,400
uh you can overlay this look at the full

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,200
life cycle. This is supply chain of

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,040
natural gas starting from your wells and

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
everything on the left over to the

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,599
right. Um all the gas consumers like

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,080
your commercial buildings, your um

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
residences, uh the use of gas and power

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,560
plants and all the pipelines, storage

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,720
facilities, compressor stations, um

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,800
processing stations, LG terminals,

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,400
whatever else it is that is in between a

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,200
well and your stove or your furnace. And

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,159
uh we take our little hazmat placard and

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,680
say, okay, how bad is all this anyway?

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,760
Um

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,239
and I'll argue to you that uh there are

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,360
hazards present across the entire supply

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,239
chain. Um we know very little about most

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
of these. Um which is, you know, this

89
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,840
could potentially be my whole research

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,360
career as a public health professional.

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,879
Um and but uh I'm going to talk in

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,599
detail about a couple of these different

93
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,040
end points just to explain that um what

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
you all are doing like you know all

95
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,120
about the climate hazards. Um you're

96
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,080
also doing a lot for uh for public

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,400
health. So I'm going to start on the

98
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,319
production side of things. Uh this is a

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,319
map of every single uh oil and gas well

100
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,879
in the United States. Um you may have

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,280
noticed that there's a lot of them. Um,

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,879
and a natural question that you should

103
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,680
be asking yourself is, okay, so how big

104
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,799
of a deal is this really? Um, going

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,639
through a hazard assessment, there's

106
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,639
like a lot of things that could be you

107
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,440
could potentially be exposed to. Um,

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,759
being I mostly focus on sort of regional

109
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,960
air pollution. Um so I did a study that

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
was focusing on the regional air

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,000
pollution aspects of this and basically

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,600
found that there are um a lot of uh

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
violations of the national ambient air

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,440
quality standards in the US that are due

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,240
to the air pollution from oil and gas

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,600
extraction. Um there's a big kind of

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
plume of ozone in the middle of the

118
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,720
country over the oil and gas um

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,400
production there. Um there's NO2 which

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
we're concerned about from a respiratory

121
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
health standpoint. um this tends to be

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,600
more concentrated in production areas

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,440
and then PM2.5 which is our standard um

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,160
aerosol um somewhere in between. So

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
that's great. Um and then running it

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,720
running it through all the science that

127
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,759
we have about who lives where and what

128
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
the health impacts of these different

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,320
pollutants are. Um we have about 7,500

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
deaths per year in the United States due

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,800
to air pollution from oil and gas

132
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,759
production. um about 410,000 asthma

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,919
attacks and 220 uh these are children

134
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
that are newly diagnosed with asthma per

135
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,880
year due to oil and gas just the

136
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,160
production side pollution in the US. Um

137
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,320
so toting up all the health damages um

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
on top of this there's like emergency

139
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,360
department visits, hospitalizations,

140
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,440
heart attacks, strokes um a whole

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560
growing menu of health outcomes that are

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,720
related to um air pollution. And uh we

143
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,039
can put a price tag on this of about 77

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,759
billion with a B dollars yearly due to

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,600
production of oil and gas. Um and as

146
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,320
you've heard um geothermal will be able

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,160
to kind of put a dent in that. So that's

148
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
just the production side. Um and I'm

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,960
going to move over to the other end of

150
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,520
this which is the stove. Um they do emit

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
air pollution. Um there's benzene which

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,199
is a carcinogen so it causes cancer.

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
There's a whole lot of volatile organic

154
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
compounds that come along with that.

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,360
there's NO2 when you burn it again and

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
methane which is the greenhouse gas that

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,280
we're all worried about from a climate

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,199
standpoint. Um so Zand, myself and maybe

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,720
a few other people in the room, Nathan

160
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,960
um were involved in a study that um

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
basically sampled gas around Boston. So

162
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,600
we put it in a canister, sent it to a

163
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,840
lab and they told us what was in it. Um

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,479
and uh it looked like an organic

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,080
chemistry textbook. Um there was uh a

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
lot of methane as expected, a lot of

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,280
ethane as expected, but a whole lot of

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,600
things that were not methane and they

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
were not ethane. Um we got hexane,

170
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,639
benzene, taluine and heptine,

171
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,319
carcinogenic, uh MPY, carcinogenic,

172
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
carcinogenic xylene, and then all these

173
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,440
other things that are also uh

174
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,199
carcinogenic. Um so they went on to keep

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
doing this kind of research. Uh turns

176
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,160
out that Boston is not the only place

177
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,080
that has a problem. Um it's uh there's

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
also issues related to these odorants um

179
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,680
which is the chemical that is uh

180
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,840
intentionally added to the gas stream so

181
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,759
we can smell it when it leaks. Um turns

182
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,440
out that humans don't like how it smells

183
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
because it is a respiratory irritant.

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,319
It's harmful. Um and potentially there's

185
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,560
other health issues related to it. Um

186
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,919
but it is uh present in all the gas

187
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,120
everywhere. Um and again looking at just

188
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,039
benzene again um basically every single

189
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,319
canister they sent to a lab had some

190
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,599
amount of benzene in it. Um Boston is

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,440
actually on the lowest end of the

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,520
spectrum as far as um benzene

193
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,080
concentrations. The highest in the US is

194
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Los Angeles and the highest of places in

195
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,000
the uh in North America that they

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,360
sampled was uh Vancouver and Los

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Angeles. So, um,

198
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,880
you know, I could go on for hours about

199
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,919
every single one of these spots, but,

200
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,400
um, I I just wanted to give folks kind

201
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,080
of a small snapshot of the types of

202
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,360
health hazards that you all are helping

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,039
to prevent by switching over to

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,479
geothermal. Um because if you uh change

205
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,919
what's going on on the right side of the

206
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,360
supply chain, you're having ripple

207
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,120
effects all the way across the supply

208
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
chain and reducing air pollution,

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,639
reducing safety hazards due to gas

210
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,039
storage, which I could talk for hours

211
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,360
about. Um reducing use of pipelines,

212
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,840
reducing compressor station pollution,

213
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,199
um and you know, really being a public

214
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,199
health resource. So that's it.

215
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,640
>> Thank you so much. I am feeling really

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,200
grateful for those three amazing talks

217
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,200
to start our day.
