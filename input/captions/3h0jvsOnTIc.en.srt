1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,800
Um today we're going to talk about the

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,920
sum trotder theorem. I mentioned the sum

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,480
trotder theorem on the first day and it

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,960
could think of as a fundamental theorem

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,960
in projection theory. It's um the the

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,400
one of the rare theorems that is

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,079
completely sharp. is just the right

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,280
answer for a natural question in

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:41,440
projection theory. Um and um and yeah,

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,040
so we're gonna talk about it. Um and see

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,800
yeah, so so there's some interesting

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,559
techniques involved in it. Um and yeah.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,520
Okay. So so that there so that so that's

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,070
what we'll do. Um all right. So let me

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,689
remind you what it says.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,689
[Applause]

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,280
So what we talked about on the first day

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,280
I called it the sum troder projection

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,280
theorem.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,240
So the setup was that you have a finite

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,240
set in the plane and you have a set of

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,240
directions

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,400
and then s= s of xd is the largest

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,400
projection of x in any of these

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,400
directions.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,040
So that's that's the if and then the

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:48,159
conclusion is that the number of

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:50,720
directions is bounded by s2 overx + 1

29
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,759
which we saw in the first.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,200
Okay. Um so this theorem is really a

31
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,200
correlary of the theorem that they

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,320
proved that is more general that I'll

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,640
that I'll state now. Um, and the more

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,399
general theorem is a theorem about how

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,399
points and lines intersect in the plane.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:21,319
Okay. So let's say X is a set of points

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,319
in the plane

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,440
and L is a set of lines in the plane.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,800
The number of incidences between X and L

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,879
is the number of pairs. So take a point

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,640
and a line so that the point is in the

42
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,319
line

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,519
and we make a picture.

44
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,959
So suppose those are our lines and these

45
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,360
are our points. Um, how many incidences

46
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,920
are there?

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,959
This line has two points in it. So that

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,519
counts two. And that line has one point

49
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,840
and that line has one point. So that's

50
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,840
four instances.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,400
You can also think of this as the sum

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,480
over all the lines in the set of lines

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,480
of the number of points on that line.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,040
This is a way of measuring sort of how

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,879
how much the points and lines are

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,720
intersecting with each other.

57
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,360
So the the general summarity troder

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,920
theorem says that um

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,400
you have some points and some lines. The

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,440
number of incidences between them is

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,319
bounded by the number of points plus the

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:57,400
number of lines plus

64
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,400
points to the 2/3 lines to the 2/3.

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,319
Okay, let's look at some examples to see

66
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,080
where this stuff comes from. Um, and the

67
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,120
examples will also remind us of the

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,120
connection with projection theory.

69
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,529
[Applause]

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
Okay. So, how could we have x

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,960
incidences? Um, that's not too hard to

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,600
do. If you have one line and you put all

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,600
the points on it,

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,680
then the number of incidences is around

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,240
x.

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,040
How could you have l incences? That's

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,360
not too hard to do either. If you have

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,639
one point and you have all the lines

79
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,400
passing through it. Um then the number

80
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,400
of incidences is around the number of

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
lines.

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,199
Okay. Now how can you get this? This is

83
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
the most the most interesting and it's

84
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,039
you know it's it's a fundamentally

85
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,120
trickier example than the first.

86
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,960
So the third example is one that we have

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,479
discussed. It's based on an integer

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,440
grid.

89
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:21,000
So let's say x is an n byn

90
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,000
integer grid.

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,759
Okay. And then we're going to try to

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,240
draw some lines that each hit many

93
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,320
points. And we observed in class on the

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,320
first day that if you have a line at a

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,680
rational slope then it will go through

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,560
many points. So those are our lines.

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,080
So let's say um so we have to make this

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,039
a little more precise. So first I'll

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,240
describe the rational slopes. So q subm

100
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,880
is defined to be the fractions a over b

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,919
where a and b are integers

102
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,919
and the a and b have size at most n.

103
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:16,520
Okay. Now our set of lines

104
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,520
is a set of lines with slope in qm.

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,080
Um and they pass through a point of x.

106
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Okay.

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,880
Oh, this is a good day for colored

108
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,720
chalk. So, here is a typical line from

109
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,039
our set of lines. I pick a rational

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,840
slope and then I start at any of the

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,840
points and I draw a line at that slope.

112
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Okay.

113
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,240
All right. So now let's try to compute

114
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,160
um how many points and how many lines

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:18,960
and how many incidences this has.

116
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,280
Um all right. So the size of x is n^2.

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,240
It's easy to see. How many different

118
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,199
slopes are we talking about? Well the

119
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,319
number of fractions is around m^2. Some

120
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,599
of those are reducible. Um but it turns

121
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,919
out that the number of distinct

122
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,680
fractions is still around m^ squ.

123
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:44,280
So this is uh

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,280
not trivial but not difficult.

125
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,240
Maybe I'll put a little something about

126
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,240
it on the homework.

127
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,840
Okay. So now

128
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,319
uh how many incidences do we have? And

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,680
we can say that

130
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,599
well each point is in a line of every

131
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
one of these slopes. So the number of

132
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,960
incidences is number of points times

133
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,960
number of slopes. So that's n^2 * m^2.

134
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,080
Okay. Now

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,440
how many different lines do we have?

136
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,879
Well we we have m² direction. We have to

137
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,560
think about how many lines are in each

138
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
direction. And actually thinking about

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
the number of lines in each direction,

140
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,080
you really you can think of it in terms

141
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,000
of projection theory.

142
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,959
So suppose S is one of our directions.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,839
Let's say pi subs the projection at

144
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:48,800
slope s of x1 and x2 is um x2 - sx1. I

145
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,519
guess the the projection whose fibers

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,519
are lines of slowbass.

147
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:13,040
All right. And um so the number of lines

148
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:16,800
in direction S is exactly

149
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,800
the size of this projection.

150
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,880
Okay. And how big is the projection?

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
Well, so let's make a little lema. Um,

152
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,640
so

153
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,360
s is in qm and x is as above. Then the

154
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,480
size of this projection

155
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,920
is bounded by m * n.

156
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,399
So proof. Um,

157
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,880
okay. So we have x1 and x2 are integers

158
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,959
between 1 and n

159
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:57,200
and s is a over b.

160
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:03,760
So if I take ps of the point x1 x2 I

161
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,279
have uh what is it? x2 - a over b x1

162
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,880
which I'll put over a common

163
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:13,200
denominator. So it's b x2 minus a x1

164
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,279
over b.

165
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,200
And this here is an integer

166
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,760
of size at most like m * n

167
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,760
m * n.

168
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,600
So there are at most m * n choices for

169
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,600
for what this could be up to a constant.

170
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay. So therefore the number of lines

171
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:50,240
is smaller than um the number of slopes

172
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:54,279
times m * n lines per slope. So that's

173
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,279
like m cubed n.

174
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,240
Okay.

175
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,959
These are written as upper bounds. There

176
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,360
are also matching lower bounds. Um so

177
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,000
the so that those upper bounds are

178
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,200
actually tight and if you do a little

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,399
algebra you will see that the incidences

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:21,360
between x and l is at least l to the 2/3

181
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,880
x^ 2/3

182
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,480
just by plugging in that this is l

183
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,720
that's the number of incidences and

184
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,720
that's x.

185
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,160
So that's where this thing comes from.

186
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,440
Okay.

187
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,519
Um

188
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
so the the two main ingredients we're

189
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,880
checking how many directions there are

190
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,959
that are have slope. how many rational

191
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,640
numbers are there with height up to m

192
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,480
and how big is each of these

193
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,120
projections? And you can take those same

194
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,560
computations and feed it into the

195
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,800
projection theory set up here. Um and

196
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,320
you you would get you would get theorem

197
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,839
one.

198
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,720
You you would get that this is a sharp

199
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,720
example for theorem one.

200
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
Okay.

201
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,959
Uh little pause for questions and

202
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,959
comments.

203
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Okay. So this example you can kind of

204
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,200
see from it that theorem one and theorem

205
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,360
two are related to each other and

206
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,839
theorem two is more general because this

207
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,760
could be any set of lines. Whereas in

208
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
theorem one in the projection theory

209
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,240
setup, we would have a set of directions

210
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,320
D and the set of lines would be all the

211
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,399
lines in direction D that go through a

212
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,639
point of X. So that's a somewhat

213
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,560
specific set of lines. And this one is

214
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,560
more general.

215
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Um,

216
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,200
so it's not very difficult to get from

217
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120
here to here and it's not that

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,800
interesting. So I got to leave it as an

219
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,800
exercise on the homework. Um

220
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,040
okay. Now another question that came up

221
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,040
on the first day is um are there other

222
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,040
examples in projection theory besides

223
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,519
this square grid that also are uh that

224
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,040
also are sharp for somebody trotder and

225
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,760
there are very few that are known but

226
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,839
since we just did this I can tell you um

227
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,680
a bit the other ones and uh it's

228
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,320
conceivable that that the list I'll show

229
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,320
you is is everything

230
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,800
Okay.

231
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,800
So, what are the sharp examples for

232
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
submar?

233
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,959
Okay. So we've just seen the

234
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,639
historically first example which is a

235
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,199
square

236
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,199
integer grid

237
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,720
and that goes back to air in the 60s. I

238
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,720
think there's a second example which is

239
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,240
a rather small variation on it but we

240
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,440
have we know so few examples that it's

241
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,920
worth mentioning. It is a rectangular

242
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,920
integer grid

243
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,279
and that was done by ele.

244
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:55,399
So instead of n byn just put n1 by n2

245
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,399
and then do a similar analysis.

246
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
Okay.

247
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,360
And then there is a third thing that we

248
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:08,079
can do which is to replace the integers

249
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,639
by integers in some other number field.

250
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,639
So for example

251
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,639
uh integers adjoin the square root of

252
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,920
two

253
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,920
um or perhaps another or perhaps other

254
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,920
neighborhoods.

255
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,040
Okay. So this is in a paper by Olivine

256
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
Silier and and and myself and it's

257
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,839
actually only currently worked out for

258
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
some special number fields, but I

259
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
suspect it works for any number field.

260
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,360
If anybody knows more about number

261
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
fields than me, this could be a nice

262
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,920
little project to work it out correctly.

263
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,360
Yeah.

264
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,360
>> One question about the rectang

265
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,000
>> um yeah, there probably is. So um

266
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,440
yeah so it you know it takes a little

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,920
writing and whatever you see what

268
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,320
happens for each one and each n1 and n2

269
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,120
um but there yeah but there are sharp

270
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,360
examples that involve not grids that are

271
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,360
not square

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,880
um okay so let me say a little more

273
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,440
precisely what this means here

274
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,959
so we would have a set

275
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,920
in our ring of things of height up to

276
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,199
So that would be the set a1 +

277
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,199
square<unk> of 2 a2 and with the

278
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:38,759
property that with so with a1 and a2

279
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,759
integers and of size up to n

280
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,880
and our our new qm

281
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,680
um

282
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,839
maybe qrm. So quotients in this ring

283
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,440
size n this would be quotients of the

284
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:57,360
form a1 + <unk>2 a2

285
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,120
over b1 + <unk>2 b2

286
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,839
where the a i and b i are integers

287
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,839
and they have norm.

288
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:14,079
Okay. And now we can do the same thing.

289
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:18,079
So L is the set of lines

290
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,760
um with slope in

291
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,160
QRM

292
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,480
and they go through

293
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:32,039
a point of of X.

294
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,039
Oh sorry X. So X is just Rn by Rn.

295
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,320
Okay, so that's the example and then if

296
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,520
you compute a little bit you'll see that

297
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,160
everything goes in a way that's

298
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,320
analogous to the first example.

299
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,960
Um and um I guess I erased the key

300
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,039
points which was unwise but uh but if

301
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
you think through the first example you

302
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,600
know we used an integer grid. What did

303
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,720
we use about integers? Basically we just

304
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,120
used that integers are are closed under

305
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,440
taking products and taking sums. That

306
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,080
was what we used in our proof. And you

307
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
know this is a ring. This is a ring. So

308
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
these guys are also in a similar way

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,120
closed under taking products and taking

310
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,120
sums. So it works the same way.

311
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200
U

312
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,760
okay. So it's a big mystery in the field

313
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
to have to have what's called an inverse

314
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,840
theorem for severity troder. An inverse

315
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,880
theorem would say that uh if you had a

316
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,559
set X and L that where this was tight

317
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,200
and where especially where this

318
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,840
dominated then what could you say about

319
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,160
X and L? Or as a special case if you had

320
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,640
a set X and a set of directions D where

321
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,400
this is tight what could you say about X

322
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,960
and D?

323
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,720
So we have uh on the one hand we have a

324
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,720
handful of examples where they're tight

325
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,400
and they're based on a lot of algebraic

326
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,520
structure. They're based on the ring of

327
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,760
integers in some number field. Um and on

328
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,400
the other hand we have very little in

329
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,640
the way of theorems that's about what

330
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,240
you know what what we can definitely say

331
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,240
about x and l if this is tight.

332
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,679
>> Yeah.

333
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,000
from kind of the quadratic number field

334
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,720
examples. Is it important for it to be

335
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,520
like a unique factoriization domain?

336
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,600
Seems like if that fails then you get

337
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,600
extra collapsing along.

338
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,160
>> Yeah. So the question is um is it

339
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,400
important whether whether our ring has

340
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,799
unique factorization?

341
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,440
Um I don't think it's I don't think it's

342
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,280
too important. Um we in our proof over

343
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,000
the integers I don't think we used

344
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,320
unique factoriization of integers

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,919
um

346
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,440
uh but you there are there are some

347
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,760
things we would have to check about each

348
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,679
number field like we'd have to check

349
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
that there are you know how many

350
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:05,280
quotients are there in this thing of

351
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,799
quotients um and um yeah so anyway so

352
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,160
there's there's I'll I'll put something

353
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,760
about it on the problem set as an

354
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,000
optional project for people who want to

355
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,360
explore

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,760
Yeah,

357
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,400
>> like for the for the original integer

358
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,600
brick case, we sort of reported nice to

359
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,320
have different slopes here. Do we have

360
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,440
some like requirements on our choice of

361
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:33,360
a I b I

362
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,600
>> um so okay so I think the comment is

363
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,440
that in the original case I said that

364
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,919
the a over b should be a reduced

365
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,240
fraction.

366
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,640
>> Yeah.

367
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,280
>> And do we have an analog of that? Yeah.

368
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:48,000
>> Yeah. Um yeah, we do. Um so you know so

369
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,280
this right so this is a set of all the

370
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,960
fractions A over B and if if a given

371
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,400
real number if a given fra rational

372
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,320
number can be represented in two

373
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,480
different ways it still only counts once

374
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,240
in Q and the same thing is true here. So

375
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,919
that you know the the same number here

376
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,080
might have more than one representation

377
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,240
of this flavor which makes it not

378
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,760
trivial to count the cardality of this

379
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,520
set.

380
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,360
Um and we and we do need to know the

381
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,840
cardality of this set to correctly

382
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,840
analyze things.

383
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,159
Um I guess something like unique

384
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,880
factoriization could come in there so

385
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,360
that there's you know before I said put

386
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
it at put it in lowest terms which is

387
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,080
maybe not quite as clear what that means

388
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,919
if you don't have unique factoriization.

389
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:42,120
>> Yeah. So say in the regime

390
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,120
x is greater than square.

391
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,880
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um let me say the question

392
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,600
back and then I'll make sure I

393
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,159
understand. Okay. So if you look at this

394
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,000
right hand side, different terms will

395
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
dominate depending upon the relative

396
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,840
sizes of X and L. And there so there's

397
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,840
sort of different regimes. Um

398
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:19,280
so one regime is that X could be bigger

399
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,440
than L squ. So they have just a ton of

400
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,240
points and not very many lines. And in

401
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,799
that situation, this term is bigger than

402
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,679
that term and that term. So in in this

403
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,679
situation the x dominates.

404
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,480
Okay. So I think the question was um can

405
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,840
we describe some structure theorem in

406
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,880
this case? Yeah. So I think we can. So

407
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,000
in that case the example

408
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,000
is example one here. Um and so the

409
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,960
structure theorem would say that um you

410
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,960
really have to have well

411
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,760
you know there there may not you know

412
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,280
let me take let me say that so in this

413
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,240
regime I don't think there's that much

414
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,200
structure so I have some lines not very

415
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,840
many and then I have a ton of points and

416
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,159
I want to have x incidences that means I

417
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,760
had better put each of my points on a

418
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,440
line so I put each point wherever I like

419
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,679
but not not off in the middle of space

420
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,679
but on one of these lines and then I get

421
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,360
this many incences

422
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,679
so there's not that much of a structure

423
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,520
theorem we could ask for here and there

424
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,960
and and there's not that much of a

425
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,679
structure theory we could ask for when

426
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,159
this dominates but here if that one

427
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,280
dominates um there are very few examples

428
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,280
and there could be a structure theory

429
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:49,799
>> sharp example in the two um has to be

430
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,799
sharp example in the projection

431
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,799
>> yeah so the question is how how do sharp

432
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,039
examples in the two things compare

433
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,640
Um so if you start with a sharp example

434
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,480
in the projection theorem um then you

435
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,240
can make a set of lines that's the set

436
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,520
of lines that go through X and have

437
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,919
directions in D and that will become a

438
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,840
sharp example in the in the general

439
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,440
theorem.

440
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,200
Now if you start with a sharp example in

441
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
the general theorem it may not have the

442
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,799
special form that makes it relevant for

443
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,919
the projection theorem. So you can't go

444
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:26,080
the other way.

445
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:29,279
always have to read that. But like the

446
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:33,120
sharp example, they are like the the

447
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,720
rectangle with the square grid and the

448
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,559
one

449
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,320
all of them they are sharp for both

450
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,480
cases.

451
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,960
>> Yeah. So all the sharp examples we

452
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,960
mentioned are sharp examples for both

453
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,960
cases.

454
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,640
Um that's right. I guess there's one

455
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,559
more comment about it that um this setup

456
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,080
is invariant under projective

457
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,080
transformations.

458
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,679
Projective transformations take lines to

459
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,640
lines and of course take points to

460
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,039
points. And so if you start with a sharp

461
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,039
example maybe coming from a grid, you

462
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,200
can apply a projective transformation to

463
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,799
it and get a new sharp example for this

464
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,880
theorem,

465
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,520
but it won't any longer correspond to

466
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,240
the projection set.

467
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,760
Um so okay so the full list of sharp

468
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,520
examples for this theorem that we know

469
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,200
about is the ones I just wrote on the

470
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,200
board plus you can apply projective

471
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
transformations.

472
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,799
Um and yeah, in terms of proving an

473
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,039
inverse theorem, which is a big open

474
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,919
problem, proving an inverse theorem for

475
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,600
this would be harder and more general

476
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,679
than proving an inverse theorem for the

477
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,000
projections.

478
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,360
But we don't but that that the one for

479
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,720
projections, we don't know either. And

480
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,679
that would be a good starting point and

481
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,679
it might be a little more accessible.

482
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,799
Okay, let's keep going. Um so the goal

483
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,159
for the class is to describe how to

484
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,679
prove this thing, right? Um so the first

485
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,120
thing I'd like the first estimate I'd

486
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,679
like to show you is a double counting

487
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,279
estimate for the incidences which is in

488
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,720
a similar flavor to the double counting

489
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,559
estimates we've done earlier in the

490
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,159
class. But let's just see how much

491
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,159
double counting tells us about this

492
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,159
problem.

493
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
All

494
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,279
right.

495
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,840
So, double counter

496
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,159
All right. So by double counting we will

497
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,960
prove the following estimate. I'll call

498
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:06,240
it lema one. The incidences between x

499
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:09,520
and l are bounded by x * l to the 12

500
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,840
plus l.

501
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,520
All right.

502
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,159
So here's the proof. Um okay. So the

503
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,960
incidences

504
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,720
are the sum over the lines and I count

505
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,600
how many points are on each line.

506
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,400
And now I'm going to Koshy Schwarz that

507
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,400
so it's less than

508
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,799
Okay. So, what do I gain by Koshi

509
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,799
Schwarzing it? Well,

510
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,440
you think about the number of points on

511
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,399
this line squared.

512
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:09,480
It's very similar to counting the number

513
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,480
of pairs of points on the line.

514
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,279
And then we can make use of the fact

515
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,480
that for any pair of points, it only

516
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:20,960
lies on one line.

517
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:25,120
All right. So I'm going to bound this by

518
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,640
um here. So okay, so it's not quite

519
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
true.

520
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,279
Let me say all right, let me say

521
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,159
something in parenthesis. It is not

522
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,320
quite true that the number of points on

523
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:39,039
the line squared is smaller than

524
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,360
the number of points on the line choose

525
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,559
two.

526
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,000
That would be true if the number of

527
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,440
points on the line is pretty large. But

528
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,159
if there's only one point on the line,

529
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,880
then this is one and this is zero. So I

530
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:54,120
have to add here um I guess I can just

531
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,120
add one.

532
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,270
Okay. So now I get two terms. So this

533
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,200
one contributes

534
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:10,600
[Applause]

535
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,600
number of points on the line choose two.

536
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,720
So I all I'm doing is changing this to

537
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,640
this. Um and then I still have my L to

538
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,240
the 1/2.

539
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,320
Um and then um if I put in one here,

540
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,320
this gives me the number of lines to the

541
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,240
1/2 which groups with that. I get the

542
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,240
number of lines and this matches that.

543
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,200
Okay. So this here represents lines that

544
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,120
contain at least two points and this

545
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,360
represents lines that contain only one

546
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,760
point.

547
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,360
All right. And now the key point is that

548
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,360
that is smaller than

549
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,960
that.

550
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,600
Right? So what are we counting here? For

551
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,000
each line, we're considering pairs of

552
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,840
points on that line.

553
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,559
But you could also think you could sum

554
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,760
over all the pairs of points and then

555
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,840
ask how many lines go through that pair.

556
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,200
And there are at most this many pairs of

557
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,360
points and for each one of them there's

558
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,360
only one line. So that's the double

559
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,360
count.

560
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:30,480
So this here is the number of x1, x2 and

561
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:32,799
l. So that x1 and x2 are on l.

562
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
If you count the lines first and then

563
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,600
add up over the lines, you get this

564
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,159
expression. But if you fix x1 and x2

565
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,480
first, there'll only be one line. And so

566
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,480
you get this.

567
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,440
All right? and and now this is that. So

568
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,440
that's the end of the proof.

569
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Okay.

570
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,640
So let's make some remarks about this

571
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,880
simple proof.

572
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,399
What double counting tells us and what

573
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,399
double counting doesn't tell us.

574
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,799
All right. So,

575
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:27,290
first we only used

576
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,279
that two points determine a line.

577
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,960
[Applause]

578
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,840
The only fact we used is that through

579
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,399
two points there's only one line.

580
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,919
So that means that it works in some more

581
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,559
general cases. So for instance it works

582
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,160
uh for points and lines over finite

583
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,329
fields

584
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,329
[Applause]

585
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,039
because over finite fields it's still

586
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,440
true that through any two points there's

587
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,440
only one line.

588
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,240
Okay. And generality is good but this

589
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,399
sort of a blessing and a curse in this

590
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,440
case um because the whole sorre troder

591
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,440
theorem is not true over finite fields.

592
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,480
I'll show you an example in a second.

593
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,279
And that means that this proof which

594
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,799
only uses this fact cannot really be

595
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,279
proving the whole summary troder

596
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,840
theorem. So that's remark B. So the

597
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,679
summarity troder theorem

598
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,000
is false

599
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,000
over FQ2.

600
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:37,919
U here's the example.

601
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,600
X is uh the entire plane, all the points

602
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,080
at Q2.

603
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,600
And L is all of the lines.

604
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,000
You could take literally all the lines.

605
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,640
Uh or you could take all of the lines y

606
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,360
= mx + b where n and b are in fq. Uh it

607
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,159
doesn't matter very much which one.

608
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:03,200
Uh okay. So size of x is q ^2. The size

609
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,519
of L is Q ^2.

610
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,919
And how many incidences do we have?

611
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:16,399
Well, each line has Q points. So

612
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:20,120
incidences between X and L is uh Q * L

613
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,120
which is Q cubed.

614
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:30,720
Okay. So this example is sharp for lammo

615
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:33,519
1. is that's equal to x L to the 12. It

616
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,960
matches that term up there and it's much

617
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,519
bigger than the right hand side of

618
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,519
summarity trotter,

619
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,080
right? Okay. Yeah. So, let's do a little

620
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,720
algebra. So, we have here an x * l to

621
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,559
the half and semi troder. We have an x

622
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,720
to the 2/3 l to the 2/3. Um, so there

623
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,080
are different regimes about who who who

624
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,760
dominates there. Um but this thing is

625
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,480
always bigger than this thing and it's

626
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:07,679
usually much bigger. Um so

627
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,879
and so here x * l is q cubed x to the

628
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:15,119
2/3 l 2/3

629
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:18,159
would be q 8/3 which is much less than

630
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,919
the number of instances. So the the sum

631
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,919
troder bound does not hold in this

632
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,919
example.

633
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,119
Okay. So um

634
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,359
okay so that shows something important

635
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,159
about the semary troder theorem that we

636
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,000
cannot prove it just by using the fact

637
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
that two points determine a line and

638
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,159
doing our double counting in a very

639
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,639
clever complicated way. we generally

640
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,480
need another input

641
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,639
and all of the proofs of summarity

642
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,839
troder theorem use somehow the topology

643
00:34:50,639 --> 00:35:00,560
of the plane. Um so see

644
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:03,839
all proofs of similar trout

645
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,800
use the topology

646
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,640
of the of the plane in some way and the

647
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,720
topology of R2 is kind of different from

648
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,720
the topology of FQ2 whatever that might

649
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
mean.

650
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,520
Okay cool.

651
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,040
Um, so I know four different proofs of

652
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,400
I've seen four different proofs of the

653
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,640
Seady Troder theorem and they use

654
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,200
topology in some different ways. I'll

655
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,200
show you just one. I think it's probably

656
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,280
the one. I don't think it the proofs are

657
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,599
not that different from each other and I

658
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,320
uh I think this probably is the one that

659
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,480
um would is the most convenient for

660
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,839
thinking about projection theory for

661
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,079
balls in R2. Yeah,

662
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,760
>> you're saying Troder, but you always

663
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,640
mean this one on the lower board, not

664
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,280
the

665
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,839
>> Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah.

666
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,520
So, we'll prove this theorem and it's

667
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,520
not very it's not too hard to see that

668
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,400
this theorem implies the one on the top.

669
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,079
Yeah.

670
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,839
Okay.

671
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,960
Um, cool. So the proof I'm going to show

672
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,960
you is based on uh cutting the plane

673
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,079
into pieces

674
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,760
and it goes back to work of Clarkson,

675
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,839
Griebus,

676
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,079
um Edles, Briner, Shereir, and Welzel.

677
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,680
Um it's not it's not the very first

678
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,320
proof, but I think it's a very nice

679
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,920
proof. Um and then it's a slightly

680
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,359
revised version of that that that

681
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,040
Netscats and I worked on. Um, okay. So,

682
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,920
it's based on cutting the plane into

683
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,880
pieces. So, let me say what I mean by

684
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,880
that by stating a lema.

685
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:50,359
All right.

686
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,359
So, cell decomposition lab.

687
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:04,480
says that if x is a finite subset of the

688
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,720
plane and s is a natural number

689
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,040
um then there's a way to cut up the

690
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,119
plane.

691
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:16,320
So it's um I think of it as a cell wall

692
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,200
and then a bunch of cells. So each one

693
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,880
of these is open and I'll call it a

694
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,320
cell.

695
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,720
and the set W is closed

696
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,599
and I'll call it the wall between the

697
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,839
cells. So the image here is that I have

698
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,640
some points.

699
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:39,760
So that's X and then um

700
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,520
have something like this. That's W and

701
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,520
this is 01, O2, 03 and 04.

702
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Okay.

703
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,680
Um

704
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,680
Okay. Okay, so it has some properties.

705
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,079
Number one,

706
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,040
each line

707
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:03,520
intersects

708
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:07,200
at most around S cells.

709
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:12,359
And also the line can intersect the wall

710
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,359
but in at most around S points.

711
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:23,040
Okay. And then um

712
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:29,800
each cell in the cell decomposition

713
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,800
has at most x over s2 uh points.

714
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,359
Okay. Now um it's not very obvious yet

715
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,960
where all this where all these formulas

716
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,440
came from. And it's definitely not

717
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,520
obvious how to prove this. Um, but it's

718
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,640
it's pretty easy to prove this in the

719
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,880
example that X is uh approximately like

720
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,960
a square grid. So, let me just show you

721
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,359
that as a motivation for where this

722
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,359
might come from

723
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,359
and to help digest what the what the

724
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,359
lema says.

725
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,400
>> Ah, yeah. So right

726
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,160
so the comment is I didn't say anything

727
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,839
about a set of lines. Um

728
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,240
so so

729
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:29,599
what what this means is uh for every

730
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,839
line L and here this is for every line.

731
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,200
Um now if we had a set of lines all we

732
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,200
would really need is to have this for

733
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,480
the lines from our set of lines. But in

734
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,640
practice it's actually just true for

735
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,640
every line.

736
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Okay.

737
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,880
All right. So, the cell decomposition

738
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,800
lama in general is some somewhat

739
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
difficult. We'll talk about the proof,

740
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,680
but let me show you an easy case that I

741
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
hope will motivate the statement.

742
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,880
>> Yeah,

743
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,760
>> we want X to not intersect the wall.

744
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,160
Looks like you just put X in the wall.

745
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:16,200
It looks like we could just put X in the

746
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,200
wall. Um, let's see here.

747
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,400
Yeah. So, another comment is that X is

748
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,720
allowed to be a subset of the wall. And

749
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,320
that sounds a little suspicious.

750
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,880
Um, but um, we do get something from

751
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,320
that because every line only hits the

752
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,640
wall in S points. So if X were a subset

753
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,520
of the wall, then every line would only

754
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,560
hit X in S points. And that would be a

755
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,800
useful tool for us, right? Also remember

756
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,280
that S is a parameter. So for each S,

757
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,560
there's a way of doing this. And we're

758
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,880
going to eventually, you know, we'll

759
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,400
look at our set of points and our set of

760
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,359
lines and then we'll pick an S that's

761
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,560
strategic. So if S is small, this is

762
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,560
really quite quite strong.

763
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,079
Okay.

764
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,079
So here's an example

765
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:19,240
is that x is uh is roughly

766
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,240
a square grid.

767
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,200
So let me make that more precise. Let's

768
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,920
say x is contained in 0 to n^2

769
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:33,720
and x intersected with a unit ball

770
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,720
around any center is small

771
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,640
and let's say that there are around n^2

772
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,160
x.

773
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,720
So what does this x look like?

774
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,240
have an n byn box

775
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:55,400
and um yeah, let me imagine cutting it

776
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,400
like a checkerboard into unit squares

777
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,359
and um this tells me that I have on the

778
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,359
order of one point of x in each unit

779
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,359
square.

780
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,359
Okay, but this is a class of sets that

781
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,520
so I call this this is like roughly a

782
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,200
square grid.

783
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,680
Okay, so now how would we cut it up?

784
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,000
I cut it up

785
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,000
like this

786
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:38,160
and over s. So the wall is S vertical

787
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,920
lines

788
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,920
union with S horizontal lines.

789
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,440
Okay,

790
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,400
so the wall cuts it into S squared

791
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,160
pieces. And because my set is

792
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,560
distributed so evenly, each of these

793
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,359
pieces has about the same size. So that

794
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,359
gives me the third bullet.

795
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,800
And if we were to make a line in this

796
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,160
picture, well, it can only cross each of

797
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,520
these other lines once. So a line will

798
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,079
intersect the wall at most 2s times.

799
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,839
And it to go from one cell to another

800
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:33,000
cell, it has to cross the wall. So we'll

801
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,000
only enter about two S cells.

802
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,359
Okay. So the

803
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,160
the bullets are not hard to check.

804
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,739
Okay.

805
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,739
[Applause]

806
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,520
Okay. Um

807
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,040
so

808
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,280
so this um de decomposition method based

809
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,760
on the key observation that it's

810
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,920
actually helpful to cut up our problem

811
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,079
like this. Cut up our space like this

812
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,880
and then count the incidences in each

813
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:22,560
cell separately and the incidences on

814
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,560
the wall. Um and in each of those pieces

815
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,240
we can use our double counting argument.

816
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,760
But when we add it up at the end, we may

817
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,880
get something better than using the

818
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,880
double counting argument globally.

819
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Okay.

820
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,960
All right. So, proof of theorem two

821
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,960
assuming this lema.

822
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:10,000
All right. So, we're given uh x and l

823
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:13,200
and s is going to be tb

824
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,400
and we can apply this uh thing.

825
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,760
Okay. So let's say that x i is x

826
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,280
intersected with oi

827
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:29,119
and we can say that x i is less than or

828
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,359
equal to less than x / s^2 that was

829
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,359
given to us as a bullet point and the

830
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:39,920
sum over i of x i is at most x because

831
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:44,079
these are disjoint sets. Okay. Um now

832
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:48,920
let's say that li is the set of lines

833
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,920
that intersect the cell oi.

834
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,599
Okay. Now these are disjoint. Each point

835
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,599
is only in one cell. These are not

836
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:04,560
disjoint. Um because a line goes through

837
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,280
many cells. So this blue line belongs to

838
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,880
LI for this I and this I and this I but

839
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:15,520
not for this I or this eye or that I.

840
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:19,040
Okay. So if you add up over I the size

841
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,319
of L I that is bounded by S times the

842
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:26,160
size of L because each line in L belongs

843
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,079
to at most S cells.

844
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,079
All right. So now let's count our

845
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,079
incidences.

846
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:38,359
So

847
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,359
there are incidences from each cell

848
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,599
and the incidences related to the E cell

849
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,560
have points from the E cell and they

850
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,880
have lines that enter the E cell.

851
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,720
There also are incidences involving the

852
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:59,720
wall. So add the incidences from X

853
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,720
intersected with the wall at L.

854
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,880
Okay. Now we apply our double counting

855
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:11,040
LMA to estimate each of these things. So

856
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:18,040
that's less than um the sum on I

857
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:18,040
X I L I to the 12 plus LI.

858
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,160
And for the wall, well, each line only

859
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,960
hits the wall s times. So we have s

860
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,960
times the number of lines.

861
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,440
Okay. Now from this point on, we just do

862
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,359
a little bit of algebra. We just have an

863
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,000
expression involving these numbers x i

864
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:47,280
and li. And we know a few inequalities

865
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,440
about x i and li. and we'll just put

866
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,839
them together.

867
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,560
Um

868
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,560
here, uh it's reasonable to Koshy

869
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,880
Schwarz because I know information about

870
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:06,160
Xi and Li separately. So that will

871
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:12,079
disentangle this sum on i Xi 2 to the 12

872
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:14,400
sum on i li to the 12. This sum on li I

873
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,440
just read that off and that can be

874
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,440
grouped with that.

875
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:26,720
Okay. Um, and now what do I do with this

876
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,720
sum of squares? Well, I know that each x

877
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,960
i is bounded by something. So, I can

878
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,880
pull that out.

879
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:38,720
So, I'll have x over s^2. And I'll have

880
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:44,160
left the sum of x i.

881
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:48,880
This sum of li is just here. So it's S L

882
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:53,760
to the 12 and I copy this.

883
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,440
Okay, this sum of X I is bounded by X.

884
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,480
And so then I'll do a little algebra

885
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,400
here. This is the important term. I'll

886
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,119
have an X^

887
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:08,160
squared to the 12.

888
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:11,040
So X and X. I'll have an L to the 12.

889
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,800
And I'll have some powers of S. There'll

890
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,440
be a 1 over s coming from here and an s

891
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,839
to the 1/2 coming from there. So al

892
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:25,400
together I have an s to the negative

893
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,400
one2 and this I'll copy over.

894
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,960
Okay, let's pause there for a second

895
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,960
after the algebra.

896
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,920
Okay. So let's take stock of the bound

897
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,960
that we got and how it compares to the

898
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,800
double counting argument.

899
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,559
If you compare this to the double

900
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,880
counting argument, the terms sort of

901
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,480
match up. So in the double counting we

902
00:49:52,880 --> 00:50:00,400
have x l to the 1/2 and that first term

903
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:03,599
gets decreased by s to the minus a half

904
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,240
when we when we uh introduce our cutting

905
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:10,160
and then the second term of l gets in

906
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,559
increased by a factor of s.

907
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:16,000
So if originally the first term

908
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:20,319
dominated then life will get better when

909
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,559
we uh do this decomposition

910
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,640
and if originally the L dominated then

911
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,720
life will not get better when we do this

912
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,920
decomposition.

913
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:33,760
Okay. So at the at the end here we just

914
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,960
choose S greater than or equal to one to

915
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,960
minimize the right hand side.

916
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,160
Um, and if you do a little bit of

917
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,559
algebra, you'll get out the summary

918
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,559
trout bound.

919
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,440
Okay.

920
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Um,

921
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,480
so I remember spending some time trying

922
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,800
to digest why things were getting better

923
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,200
when we subdivided.

924
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,720
And here was one thought I had about it.

925
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,319
If you look at the double counting

926
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,440
bound, there are these different

927
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:11,200
regimes. So there's a regime where the

928
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,880
left term dominates and in that regime

929
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,559
the double counting bound is bigger than

930
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,160
the truth

931
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,000
and there's a regime where the right

932
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,000
term dominates

933
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,680
and you can always have L incidences so

934
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,559
that's not that when the right term

935
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,559
dominates it's the truth

936
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,760
okay and so what are the regimes the the

937
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,240
right term that the L dominates if L is

938
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,000
bigger than X square.

939
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,200
So we have a lot of lines compared to

940
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,720
the number of points then um then double

941
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:45,599
counting already gives a sharp bound.

942
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,520
Okay. So suppose originally that L is

943
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,079
not bigger than X squ. So if I just

944
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,160
apply double counting out of the box the

945
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,640
the X L to the half would dominate which

946
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:58,000
I'm not so happy with.

947
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:01,359
Then I try cutting things up into cells.

948
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,640
I count the incidences in each cell.

949
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:08,480
Is life any better?

950
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:10,240
Well, I have S squared cells. So, if I

951
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,000
if I look and and the points are kind of

952
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,480
evenly distributed. So, if I look inside

953
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
one cell, the number of points goes down

954
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,240
by S^ squ, which is quite a lot.

955
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,079
How about lines? Well, not every line

956
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,720
goes through this cell. So, the number

957
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,280
of lines also goes down.

958
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,079
But because each line goes through many

959
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,680
cells, each line goes through S cells,

960
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,240
the fraction of lines that I would

961
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,200
expect to go through this cell is 1 / s

962
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,040
of all the lines.

963
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,960
So the number of points goes down a lot

964
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,119
and the number of lines only goes down a

965
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,800
little.

966
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,200
By doing that, I'm tilting things

967
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,000
towards having a lot of lines and few

968
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,599
points. And if you think about if you if

969
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,400
you track you know what is the best

970
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,200
value of this S. What happens is the S

971
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,280
is best when we cut it in such a way

972
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,319
that inside of each cell the number of

973
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,920
lines is the number of points squared.

974
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,920
And that means the double counting is

975
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,920
giving the correct bound inside of each

976
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,920
cell.

977
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,200
Okay. Uh, questions or comments.

978
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,960
Okay. So, let's talk about how to prove

979
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,040
the cell decomposition LMA, which uses a

980
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,960
little bit of topology.

981
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:47,119
Um so in our cell decomposition lema we

982
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,359
want to take our points and kind of cut

983
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:53,280
them up in evenly in some way and that

984
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,839
is reminiscent of a classical thing in

985
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,079
topology called the ham sandwich theorem

986
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,599
and the cell decomposition lama is like

987
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,839
a like a cause a variant of the ham

988
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,280
sandwich theorem. So I will first recall

989
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:07,599
the ham sandwich theorem and how to

990
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,559
prove that and then we'll we'll uh work

991
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:14,400
up to this.

992
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:17,280
All right. So our our starting point in

993
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:20,280
topology is going to be the Borsuk ulong

994
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,280
theorem.

995
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,040
So I'll I'll recall that. I'll state

996
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:29,000
that and then we'll try to prove

997
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,000
everything else from from Borsukan.

998
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,960
All right.

999
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,599
So the borsak gulam theorem says that if

1000
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,119
you have a function from the n sphere to

1001
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:56,240
rn which is continuous

1002
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:59,520
and it's antipodal. So that means f of

1003
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:02,880
negative theta is negative f of theta

1004
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:06,720
for every theta in the sphere. Um then

1005
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:10,160
the conclusion is that 0 is in the image

1006
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:14,119
of f. There is some some point in the

1007
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,119
sphere that got mapped to zero.

1008
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Okay.

1009
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:29,280
Um,

1010
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:33,880
so as a correlary of that, we're gonna

1011
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,880
do the ham sandwich theorem.

1012
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,440
So one version of the ham sandwich

1013
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:48,480
theorem says that if 01 up to O N

1014
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:50,079
contained in Rn are bounded open sets

1015
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,160
um

1016
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:56,880
then there exists a hyper plane H that

1017
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,880
bisects the

1018
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,559
So for instance, if I had two bounded

1019
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:15,760
open sets in the plane, there would be a

1020
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:19,000
line somewhere that bisects both of

1021
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,000
these sets.

1022
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:29,680
Okay, so proof. Um, so first we need to

1023
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,599
sort of parameterize our choice of all

1024
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,599
the hyperplanes.

1025
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,480
And a good way to think about that is

1026
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,599
that a hyper plane is related to a

1027
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:43,280
linear function.

1028
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:45,359
So this is a hyper plane. I also I'm

1029
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,920
going to have one a hyper plane and one

1030
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:50,799
side of it. or pay attention to which

1031
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,400
side is which. So this shaded region

1032
00:56:50,799 --> 00:57:00,880
would be the region um

1033
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:02,640
a1 x1 plus a n xn is bigger than b. So

1034
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,480
one side of a hyper plane can always be

1035
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,640
described that way and we have the

1036
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:13,760
freedom to scale a. Um so let's say that

1037
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:16,079
theta is a1 up to a n comma b that could

1038
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:20,319
be in the n sphere by scaling theta

1039
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:22,160
which doesn't change the hyper plane.

1040
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:24,640
Okay,

1041
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,440
so those are my hyperplanes. And now f

1042
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,359
of theta

1043
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,359
um

1044
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:33,359
let me say

1045
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:36,960
here let me say it this way. This guy

1046
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:42,319
plus b is bigger than zero.

1047
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:46,760
And uh this thing here I will call l sub

1048
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:46,760
theta of x.

1049
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:57,119
Okay. So f of theta is f subi of theta

1050
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:59,680
is the volume of oi intersect l theta is

1051
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,160
bigger than zero. That's the volume of

1052
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:06,960
oi on this side

1053
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:11,000
minus the volume of oi and l l sub theta

1054
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,000
is smaller than zero.

1055
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,760
So f_subi of theta is the volume of this

1056
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:20,920
part of oi minus the volume of that part

1057
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,920
of oi.

1058
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:28,960
Okay. So notice that fi of theta is zero

1059
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,760
if and only if the hyper plane

1060
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:35,400
associated to theta

1061
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,400
biseects oi.

1062
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:45,119
Okay. Um also

1063
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,720
f_si is antipotal

1064
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,480
f_subi of minus theta is negative f_subi

1065
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,760
of theta

1066
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,799
because if I replace theta by minus

1067
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,880
theta I take the minus of all these

1068
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:02,240
coefficients and I'm replacing l of

1069
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,839
theta by negative l of theta and so that

1070
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,000
switches

1071
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,839
uh who so I so I'll have the same zero

1072
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,280
set the same hyper plane but now this

1073
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,079
one will be positive and that one will

1074
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,400
be negative.

1075
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:17,319
So I'll switch these two things which

1076
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,319
reverses the sign of fi of theta.

1077
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,760
Okay.

1078
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,880
Um

1079
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:30,559
f_subi is also continuous.

1080
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,280
So if I adjust theta then I'll make a

1081
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,720
small motion of this plane and that will

1082
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,640
change these volumes but only

1083
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,559
continuously because the sets are

1084
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:45,359
bounded and open.

1085
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:49,280
Okay, so finally I'll make f by just

1086
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:52,880
putting together all these fns. And so f

1087
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:58,040
is a function from the n sphere to rn

1088
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,040
and it's continuous and it's antipodal.

1089
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:03,520
So the conclusion is

1090
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,480
so then Borsagulam tells me that there

1091
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,559
exists some theta. So that f of theta is

1092
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:13,960
zero and that means that h theta bisects

1093
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,960
all these sets.

1094
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,040
Okay.

1095
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,160
Um

1096
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:31,680
all right. Now this by itself is not

1097
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:34,640
going to be super helpful for us. Um we

1098
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,640
have a set that lives in the plane. So

1099
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,960
the theorem says you know I can find a

1100
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:43,760
line that bisects any two things. Um I'm

1101
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,880
hoping to take a complicated set and cut

1102
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,440
it into many even pieces. And so a more

1103
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,880
relevant warm-up is some way of bicting

1104
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:58,079
many sets not just two.

1105
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:59,680
Um okay. So if I put more open sets here

1106
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,760
then there will not be a hyper plane

1107
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:06,880
that bisects all of them but I could be

1108
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,720
more flexible about what sort of cut I

1109
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,920
would allow. So it can't be a hyper

1110
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,160
plane. It has to be a little bit more

1111
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,720
complicated. And it turns out to be a

1112
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,280
reasonable idea to consider cuts by

1113
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,960
polomials of some degree. And there's a

1114
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,559
so there's a natural generalization of

1115
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,200
this.

1116
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,799
Uh you could do really any class of

1117
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,880
functions but but for this application

1118
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:31,240
polomials are useful and it's called the

1119
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,240
polomial ham sandwich theorem.

1120
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,440
All right.

1121
01:01:53,200 --> 01:02:02,079
All right. So here's

1122
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:04,400
here's a more general version polomial

1123
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:08,160
hand sandwich.

1124
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,079
Okay. So let's say polomials of degree D

1125
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,319
in Rn

1126
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,200
that is the set of polomials so

1127
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:18,799
polomials

1128
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:21,200
in n variables over R so that the degree

1129
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:26,280
is at most D

1130
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,280
and so this is a vector space

1131
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:35,920
and it has dimension approximately d to

1132
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,200
the n. If you if if the dimension n is

1133
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,200
fixed and the degree is going to

1134
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,200
infinity

1135
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:48,240
u the dimension is not hard to figure

1136
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,359
out. You count how many monomials are

1137
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,359
there of degree at most d.

1138
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,599
Okay.

1139
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:03,200
Um so the proposition says

1140
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:05,040
that if capital n is strictly less than

1141
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:08,319
the dimension

1142
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,000
of this space

1143
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:13,680
then

1144
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,440
there exists a polomial p the space of

1145
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,960
polomials

1146
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,599
which is non zero

1147
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:25,760
and the polomial bisects each of the

1148
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:31,119
open sets. So let's say

1149
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:36,720
fi of p is defined to be um

1150
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:41,680
the volume of oi intersect p is positive

1151
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:43,760
minus the volume of oi intersect p is

1152
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:49,119
negative

1153
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:52,920
and uh fi of p equals zero for all i

1154
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,920
from one up to Okay,

1155
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,799
so that's the statement of the

1156
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,520
proposition. Instead of using a hyper

1157
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:01,920
plane, we use a degree D the zero set of

1158
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,480
a degree D polinomial to bisect our

1159
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:07,839
sets. And then we can bict many more

1160
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:11,359
sets. And this is exactly how many. As D

1161
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:13,200
increases, we have more uh degrees of

1162
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:16,920
freedom, bigger dimension, and we can

1163
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,920
bisect more things.

1164
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,319
Um so at the level of intuition you can

1165
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,079
think of this in terms of degrees of

1166
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,760
freedom.

1167
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,440
Um

1168
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,440
so

1169
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,200
the dimension of this space tells us

1170
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,280
sort of how many degrees of freedom we

1171
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,839
have to play with. Each one of these is

1172
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,440
a constraint. And if the number of

1173
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,160
degrees of freedom is at least the

1174
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,760
number of constraints then the then the

1175
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,760
theorem says we can actually find a

1176
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,760
solution.

1177
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,400
Okay.

1178
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Um, the proof is essentially the same as

1179
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:57,920
this. So, proof, what do I need to

1180
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:01,400
check? Um, well, fi.

1181
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,400
So I I've

1182
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,480
so I just need to check

1183
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:14,240
that fi are continuous

1184
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:17,480
and fi of negative theta is negative fi

1185
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,480
of theta.

1186
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,160
Okay. So why is it continuous? I won't

1187
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,000
do a full proof but if you adjust the

1188
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,240
coefficients of this polomial a little

1189
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,400
bit then the set where it's positive

1190
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,079
changes but only a little bit and so

1191
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,039
this volume should only change a little

1192
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,079
bit that's continuity

1193
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:40,240
and why is it antipotal well if I switch

1194
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:43,799
P to negative P um actually yeah let me

1195
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,799
put P's here

1196
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:52,880
if I switch P to negative P then it

1197
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:57,599
interchanges these two sets and so it

1198
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:59,839
swi switches the sign of fi of p.

1199
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,920
Okay,

1200
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:05,760
cool.

1201
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:09,359
All right. And now f is going to be

1202
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:12,480
f_sub_1 up to fn.

1203
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:17,119
Now f is a map from where to where. F is

1204
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:19,920
a map from polomials of degree D on Rn

1205
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:24,039
take away zero

1206
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,039
to RN.

1207
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,960
Why is that?

1208
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,799
Okay,

1209
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,559
I was waving my hands a little bit when

1210
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:41,599
I said that f is fi is continuous.

1211
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:43,440
um and uh fi is is not continuous at

1212
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,200
zero.

1213
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,920
If you know if the polinomial is zero

1214
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,079
then both of these sets are empty. So I

1215
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:55,760
guess by the definition fi of zero would

1216
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:58,640
be zero. Um but um uh then if I move p a

1217
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,200
tiny bit so it's not zero then these

1218
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:03,200
sets are these sets will appear and

1219
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,240
they're they take up most of space. So

1220
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,839
there would be sort of a jump

1221
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,760
discontinuity in those sets. Um so the

1222
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:12,000
reason we had to do this is that fi is

1223
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,799
only continuous on the space of

1224
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,960
polinomials without zero. So if I take a

1225
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:18,720
nonzero polinomial and I change the

1226
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,680
coefficients a little bit then this set

1227
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,680
will only change a little bit.

1228
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,400
Okay.

1229
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,599
that. So actually I should say that

1230
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:42,559
that's not completely trivial that fact.

1231
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:45,559
Um it takes a little a little proving

1232
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,559
um

1233
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,640
it's related to the fact that if you

1234
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:54,720
have a nonzero polomial then any of its

1235
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,440
level sets like cannot have positive

1236
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,079
volume.

1237
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,880
If you have like polomial equals 3 that

1238
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,400
defines a hypersurface and it cannot

1239
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,480
happen that that hypersurface has

1240
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,920
positive volume and that's basically

1241
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,920
what you need to check that this is

1242
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,920
continuous.

1243
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:19,279
Okay. So this is a space from here to

1244
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:22,880
here and to apply borsk ulam I need to

1245
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:26,000
have a sphere for my domain. So this

1246
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:28,000
sphere is sitting in here as long as n

1247
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,440
is strictly less than the dimension of

1248
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,920
this space. So this is this is where we

1249
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,920
use this hypothesis.

1250
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,239
Okay. And then Borsulam says that zero

1251
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:49,560
is in the image of f which is what we're

1252
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,560
trying to prove.

1253
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:08,239
Okay,

1254
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:09,600
cool.

1255
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:11,359
All right, so we're getting close to

1256
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,839
having a tool that we can use to do this

1257
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:17,279
decomposition. And now we have a little

1258
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:20,319
technical issue or a little mismatch

1259
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,400
because in what we want is to start with

1260
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,159
a finite set and have a cell

1261
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,319
decomposition that kind of cuts it into

1262
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:29,440
into even pieces.

1263
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:31,279
And um this proposition is about open

1264
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,359
sets. If we have a bunch of open sets,

1265
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,359
we can simultaneously cut them each in

1266
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,000
half. So we need a version where the

1267
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,600
open sets are replaced by finite sets.

1268
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,560
And that's not difficult to do. It's

1269
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,719
just a technical thing. Oh, that's how

1270
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,719
it works.

1271
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:50,139
[Applause]

1272
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:21,360
Okay. So proposition

1273
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:25,880
um if SI contained in R2 or Rn I guess

1274
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,880
is okay are finite sets

1275
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:36,080
I = 1 up to N and N is less than the

1276
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:37,840
dimension of poly D of Rn

1277
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:40,960
um then

1278
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:43,280
there exists a nonzero polomial poly D

1279
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,280
of Rn

1280
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,960
So that

1281
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,360
um what does it mean? So in some sense

1282
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:55,120
we'd like this polomial to bisect these

1283
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:58,080
sets. Um but we have to say something

1284
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:01,600
slightly weaker and I'll explain why. So

1285
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:05,040
that SI intersect

1286
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:08,960
P positive is less than or equal to SI /

1287
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:15,800
2 and SI intersect

1288
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:15,800
P negative is less than SI / 2,

1289
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:22,000
right? Okay. So you know this set could

1290
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,159
be a set of three points. So it's not

1291
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,520
possible that half of them will be

1292
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,440
positive and half of them will be

1293
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,679
negative. So the best we could hope to

1294
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:33,800
is that one would be positive, one would

1295
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,800
be negative and one would be zero.

1296
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,560
Okay.

1297
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:43,040
Um Okay. So proof

1298
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,560
for any epsilon bigger than zero, let's

1299
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:49,280
say O epsilon I is the epsilon

1300
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,840
neighborhood of SI.

1301
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:56,480
So that's an open set. And so we can

1302
01:11:51,840 --> 01:12:01,920
apply our proposition to that set.

1303
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:06,400
apply polomial ham sandwich

1304
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:09,760
to O epsilon I and we output a polomial

1305
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:11,910
pepsilon which is in the unit sphere in

1306
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,100
the space of polomials

1307
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:15,100
[Applause]

1308
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:22,880
uh and it bisects them. So we know that

1309
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:26,800
the volume

1310
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:34,199
of oepsilon I intersect P bigger than

1311
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:34,199
zero is half of the volume of oepilon I

1312
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,360
okay so we have this for every epsilon

1313
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:42,560
and now we want to take some kind of

1314
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:47,360
limit as epsilon goes to zero and the

1315
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:49,199
sphere is compact so the sphere sn is

1316
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,880
compact.

1317
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:54,960
So we have a subsequence

1318
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,360
uh pepsilon

1319
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:03,640
some subsequence of them converges to a

1320
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:03,640
limit p which is a polomial in sn

1321
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:13,560
okay and the claim is that the p does

1322
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,560
the job.

1323
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,120
So

1324
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:21,520
let's say this is the zero set of P.

1325
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:25,440
Over here P is positive and down here P

1326
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,800
is negative. And suppose a particular SI

1327
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:33,400
was not split up evenly like this. It's

1328
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,400
more than half of that on that side.

1329
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:38,360
Um here let me do that

1330
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,800
yellow.

1331
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:50,800
There's SI. So why can't that happen?

1332
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:55,360
Well, think about what

1333
01:13:50,800 --> 01:14:00,679
the eps pepsilon would be doing.

1334
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,679
So oepsilon i would look like this.

1335
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:10,159
And what would pepsilon look like? Well,

1336
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,679
it's a little perturbation of p. We take

1337
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:15,600
uh you know we have some convergence. So

1338
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:19,120
so that would be the zero set of

1339
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:22,239
pepsilon here's pepsilon is positive

1340
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:26,280
here is pepsilon is negative

1341
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:26,280
and that violates this.

1342
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,920
So

1343
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:39,120
if SI intersect

1344
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:45,600
P is positive was strictly greater than

1345
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:48,719
12 of SI um then we'd have O epsilon I

1346
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:53,840
intersect Pepsilon positive would be

1347
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:56,320
strictly greater than 12 of OI epsilon I

1348
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,320
contradiction

1349
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,120
Okay.

1350
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:11,080
Okay. So now let's prove the cell

1351
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,080
decomposition lema.

1352
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,719
So we improve the cell decomposition

1353
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:26,679
lama by using the polomial by using this

1354
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,679
proposition many times.

1355
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,120
Okay. So we have some set of points

1356
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:43,760
x

1357
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:49,679
and first we use our uh proposition with

1358
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:51,840
um n equals 1 and so d equals 1.

1359
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:53,679
So we're only so actually easy case of

1360
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,679
our proposition we're only bicting this

1361
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:59,440
one set of points. So here's p1 equals

1362
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:03,280
z.

1363
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:08,320
So the output is a polomial P1 of degree

1364
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:13,920
D1 = 1 and it bisects the set.

1365
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:19,199
So we have X plus is the set of X and X

1366
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:22,400
where P1 of X is positive etc.

1367
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:27,760
Okay. Then we use our proposition with

1368
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:31,199
n= 2 and we get a polomial P2 of degree

1369
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,960
D2. D2 would probably also be one, but

1370
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:37,840
it let me just put sort of the general

1371
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:42,199
thing. So it would be less than our N2

1372
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,199
uh to the 12.

1373
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:54,679
Um okay. And P2 P2 bisects X plus and X

1374
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,679
minus.

1375
01:16:54,719 --> 01:17:00,719
So here's the zero set of P2

1376
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:02,800
[Applause]

1377
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,199
and it bisects each half. So now I've

1378
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:10,400
divided X into quarters.

1379
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:13,600
Okay. And we keep going. So at step K,

1380
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:18,800
I use my proposition and I have N K

1381
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:22,000
which is 2 K and DK which is less than N

1382
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:24,320
K to the 12. So that's like 2 to the k

1383
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,400
over two

1384
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:30,719
and uh and I I output a polinomial pk

1385
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:33,360
and it bisects

1386
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:37,480
the 2 to the k minus one previous guys

1387
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,480
or two to the k previous guys.

1388
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:45,280
So I'll draw one more. I have four

1389
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:48,920
pieces and I find a new polomial and I

1390
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,920
bict all four.

1391
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,880
Okay. So now uh when do I stop? I choose

1392
01:17:54,239 --> 01:18:01,440
the final K.

1393
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:05,199
So 2 to the K is S squared.

1394
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:09,400
And that means the final DK around 2 the

1395
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:09,400
K / two is around S.

1396
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:17,320
Okay. So since I bisect at every stage

1397
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:28,560
um I get x intersect o y smaller than x

1398
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:31,800
/ 2 k which is like x s^2. So that's my

1399
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,800
third bullet.

1400
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,320
So I'm trying to prove

1401
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,400
each cell has only a 1 over s^ squ

1402
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:45,440
fraction of the original points. We have

1403
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:47,840
that. And then I'm trying to think about

1404
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,520
uh how each how the lines intersect the

1405
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,520
cells and how the line intersects the

1406
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,520
walls.

1407
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,400
So these are the different cells and the

1408
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:01,600
red stuff is the walls. So if I draw a

1409
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:04,600
line here,

1410
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,600
um

1411
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:15,280
the line intersected with the wall

1412
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:17,840
is smaller than d1 + dot dot dot plus dk

1413
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:20,480
because you know how how many times does

1414
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,239
a line intersect the zero set of a

1415
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:26,120
polomial?

1416
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:26,120
It's at most the degree.

1417
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,320
Okay,

1418
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:35,199
so these degrees are bounded by 2 to the

1419
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:37,520
2 to the k / 2. So this this is a

1420
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:40,400
geometric series.

1421
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:43,520
It's bounded by its last term 2 the k /

1422
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:47,600
2 which is around s.

1423
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:49,840
So that's the second bullet.

1424
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,600
Okay. And every time this pol this line

1425
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,760
moves from one cell to another, it has

1426
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,440
to cross the wall. So that also bounds

1427
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,440
the number of cells that the line

1428
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,440
intersects.

1429
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,120
Okay. So that ends this the proof or

1430
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,640
proof sketch of the cell decomposition

1431
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:13,159
lema.

1432
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:13,159
Um any questions or comments?
