00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm Sarah Hansen and today I'm talking

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,160
with Anna Bell. She's a super smart

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,800
programmer, author, and senior lecturer

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,880
at MIT. Her computer science videos on

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,800
our channel have captivated millions of

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,880
learners around the world. Today, we

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,720
talk about Python, growth mindset, and

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,359
rubber ducks. I have to know what the

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,119
ducks are now. Like, I I can't continue.

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,279
Then I ask her, with the emergence of

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,680
AI, do we even still need to learn how

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,480
to code? What's the value proposition of

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,640
learning a language like Python? Do we

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,000
still need to do it? So, not sure if

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,920
this exactly answers the question. Oh,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,040
tell me more. Find out her answer today

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,200
on Chalk Radio. Hi, Anna. Hi. How are

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,160
you? I'm good. You're here. I'm so

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,079
excited. Yes, me, too. This is one of

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,719
our pilot episodes for something new

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,440
that we're trying, which is a video

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,680
version of our Chalk Radio podcast. Many

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
ways, it's an experiment. How do you

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,280
feel about experiments? Are you an

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,359
adventurous person? No, not at all. Oh,

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,600
great. We're going to be great. Yeah, I

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,440
like stability and I like boring days.

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
Oh, well, I'm not sure we're going to

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,680
have one of those with these with these

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,760
ducks and so I I actually don't know

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,640
what the ducks mean. Um, so I think

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,640
you're going to tell me a little bit

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,439
later, but as we Yeah, I think we're in

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,880
for an adventure and a little bit maybe

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,640
of a choose your own adventure. Mhm. So,

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,439
you're at MIT, you've been here for

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,560
about 10 years. Um, and you spend most

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,720
of your time thinking about and teaching

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,320
people who are new to programming,

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,240
introducing them. And I'm wondering what

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,159
that means to you, why you're interested

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,400
in teaching in particular, like people

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,600
like me. What do you get out of that?

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,799
And tell me about that experience. Um,

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,520
so I recognize that I well I don't want

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,240
everyone to become a computer scientist,

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,320
but I do think that everyone should

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
learn programming as a skill. So

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,200
programming is should become sort of

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,640
like what math is now where you kind of

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,479
learn it in um elementary school and you

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,479
obviously use it here and there in your

53
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,799
adult life. But I don't know, you know,

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
when you've last used calculus, right?

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
like we don't all need to become

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,800
mathematicians after we've learned basic

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,599
math. Similarly, I do think people

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
should learn basic programming, but they

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,920
don't have to become computer

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,959
scientists. So, the reason that I enjoy

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,040
teaching students intro programming and

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,400
exposing them to intromputer science is

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,160
because it was really hard for me to

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,959
understand programming when I first

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,080
started and I just always remember how

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,160
tough it was.

67
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,840
And I'm at right I teach at MIT and

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
there's obviously a lot of really smart

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,480
people here. And I think as you teach

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,560
more and more it's easy to forget how

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,720
hard it was to start learning. And so

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
you know as an intro course you know you

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,840
might make the problems you give

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,599
students harder and harder each year

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,440
just because they get maybe boring for

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,080
you but it's not boring for the

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,000
students. And I try to recognize that

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
every like every semester I just

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,760
remember it was really hard for me.

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
they've never seen this before. So, it's

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,720
really important to make sure that they

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
have a really good experience. You

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,800
mentioned that when you first started

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
programming it was difficult. Y I'm

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,640
wondering like what made it difficult

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,680
and then what are you doing in your

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,200
teaching to make it less difficult? I

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
honestly don't know what made it

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,800
difficult. The the beginning was easy

90
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,440
just kind of understanding the basics of

91
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,840
just you know writing uh the basics of

92
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,440
creating an algorithm is basically three

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,879
things. So the first is a sequence of

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,000
steps. So step one, step two, step

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,239
three. Um some sort of way to control

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,400
the flow of those steps. So usually you

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,400
go step by step, but at some point you

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
say, well, if this is true, do this,

99
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,879
otherwise do this. So like a branching

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,799
kind of idea. And then there's also a

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,040
way to control the flow by asking the py

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120
the program to repeat certain lines. So

103
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,879
it's like, well, if this is true, go

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
back and repeat this a million times,

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,840
which is very easy for a computer to do.

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
So a sequence of steps, a way to control

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
the flow of those steps, and then a way

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,360
to stop. Those are the three things that

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
make an algorithm. That's that's how you

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,959
write a program. And the grasping that

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,479
was not hard. It was just sort of once

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,239
you've gotten over that learning curve,

113
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,919
it's learning sort of some of the more

114
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,680
advanced concepts that were

115
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,080
um that were harder some of the details

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,400
for how that specific language works. So

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,560
I started with Java, not Python, which

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,080
was a little which was harder than it's

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
a lot harder than Python. There's a

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,520
bunch of details that you need to think

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,960
about there. So I had the opportunity to

122
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,000
watch some of your lecture videos. Yeah.

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,720
And I noticed that you make space and

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,919
time for students to practice like right

125
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,440
in the class itself. Um definitely

126
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,280
outside the class as well, but like in

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,199
the actual space where you're teaching.

128
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,560
And I'm wondering if you could talk

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,680
about that a little bit, why you do

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,440
that.

131
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
Yeah. So, I think I mentioned this

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
before. I sort of see programming like

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,639
math is now, but this will be, you know,

134
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,440
many years from now. Um, it's a skill

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,919
that people need to get that they don't

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,680
have yet. And so, if we think about the

137
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,759
way we learn math in school, it's a lot

138
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,400
a lot of practice, right? You just

139
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,000
always constantly practice adding,

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,520
subtracting, multiplying, right? The

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
kids. Yeah. So I think it's very

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,759
important for students to actually get

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the time to to do to do that practice.

144
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
The way I run the class is a sort of a

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
flip classroom or a blended learning

146
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,280
style where students watch sort of the

147
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,039
basics through video first and then in

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
the actual classroom we do active

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,400
learning. So, uh, I go over maybe

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,960
something that's a little bit more

151
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,680
confusing and then I give them time to

152
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,479
break with the hope that me forcing them

153
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,000
to have them actually start coding,

154
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,360
they'll be able to see, oh, um, I

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
totally understood what she was talking

156
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,560
about in the video and I can totally

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,560
code that, but then when they actually

158
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
when I'm forcing them to actually do it,

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,880
you know, starting with a blank slate,

160
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,039
it's pretty daunting. And so I want them

161
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,120
to get over that bump where it's like

162
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,960
you have a blank piece of, you know,

163
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,319
blank editor or whatever. And then you

164
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,639
just have to start writing something

165
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
down once the more you do it, the more

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,240
you feel comfortable with it. So there's

167
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
all these breaks for all these

168
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,720
activities that I that I try to keep the

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,880
class lively, of course, and and kind of

170
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,600
indirectly have them practice these

171
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,759
skills like just just write something

172
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,759
just write something down. Yeah. And

173
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,440
also that does two things I think. Um it

174
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,520
deemphasizes perfection. You're like

175
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
this is practice like Yep. I think like

176
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,000
an artist, right? So just like get a

177
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,080
sketch, write a few lines like just get

178
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,960
something down. Yes. And then we can

179
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479
improve it. Yep. Um and then that speaks

180
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
to something else you've mentioned

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,120
before and that's like growth mindset

182
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,800
and that programming is not like a gift

183
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,800
and you have it or you don't but it's

184
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,039
really something that can be developed.

185
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
Yeah. A lot of a lot of you know you see

186
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,120
some people who are really good at

187
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,199
programming they didn't get good just

188
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
because they had that skill they were

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
born with it right there's a lot of

190
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,319
growth mindset involved in that and

191
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,919
anybody can reach that level of being

192
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,880
good at at something programming

193
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,560
included just by lots of practice trying

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,720
different things challenging themselves

195
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,880
so not just sticking to things that are

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,759
obviously way too easy because then

197
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,599
you'll never grow but you kind of like I

198
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,240
don't know if you know this um the state

199
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,240
of flow. It's like this chart where you

200
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
kind of want to be in this like middle

201
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,360
band

202
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,039
um but kind of oscillating between doing

203
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,639
things that are too easy and then

204
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,280
challenging yourself and doing things

205
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,720
that a little bit harder. Um and not you

206
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,720
don't want to always do two things too

207
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,879
hard because then that's discouraging

208
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
and you'll stop. But you don't want to

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,440
do things that are always too easy

210
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,879
because then you'll never grow. I wonder

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,199
if we could write an algorithm for

212
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,240
staying in the flow like it tracks like

213
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,160
oh this is too easy for you get in a lot

214
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,720
of the education platforms right are

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
trying to give uh students based on

216
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,919
their responses you know even in math

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,440
questions right and be like oh this

218
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,879
student totally got all these let me

219
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
give them a harder one and it's like oh

220
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
that was too hard let me yeah how did

221
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,879
you find your way to programming is this

222
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,520
something that you've always wanted to

223
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:30,560
do or did it develop along the way um so

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,039
my my parents immigrated from Romania

225
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
and we went uh we immigrated to Canada

226
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,240
and my dad was a electrical engineer and

227
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,919
then he went into software engineering

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,680
and uh being an immigrant uh immigrant

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,200
parents from Europe uh we were highly

230
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,600
encouraged my sister and I were highly

231
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,279
encouraged to get uh some sort of

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,959
engineering job right so it's just what

233
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,480
what what is done and so uh computer

234
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,080
computer engineering or computer

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,680
science, something along those lines

236
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,440
seemed to be the best option uh given

237
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,720
sort of where things were going in the

238
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,320
future. This was the '9s. Um so just the

239
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,519
beginning of the internet, the beginning

240
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,839
of all that um right that boom. Uh, so

241
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,880
my dad recognized that that was sort of

242
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,880
what the what the future would be and he

243
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,399
said, "You should probably learn to

244
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,680
program and potentially go, you know,

245
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,920
and probably go into that sort of

246
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,279
career." And I wasn't super interested

247
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,839
in anything else, so I just said,

248
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:39,680
"Sure." Um, and so he taught us Java

249
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,200
when I was about 12. Um, I have a a

250
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,399
picture here. Oh, yeah. Let's see it.

251
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
Okay. And it's in this really cool

252
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:50,000
frame. Oh, I love that frame. Okay. Uh,

253
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:54,480
very fitting. And so this is this um

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,519
this is very '9s. Like this exudes '90s.

255
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,920
Peak '9s right there. So we've got the

256
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
room with the computer, right? Like as

257
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
was in the '9s. You all had like the

258
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,480
room with the computer. Yes. And then

259
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,200
like the big chair and the side ponytail

260
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,880
or whatever. That's me on the on the on

261
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
the left there. That's me. Yep. Yep. And

262
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,360
that's my sister in the on the chair. Uh

263
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,279
sitting on the chair. Yeah. And that's

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,079
when we first um or maybe before like

265
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,720
very close to the time that we had first

266
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,240
uh started programming. My dad just

267
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,160
said, you know, here's you know, here's

268
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,040
some really basic things. And then I

269
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,720
only got to the the if like the the

270
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,399
branching part of the control flow. I

271
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,079
didn't really get to the repeating part

272
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
of the control flow. So I made this

273
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,680
choose your own adventure program where

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
it was like I forget what it was like.

275
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,959
get out and you know exit a castle or

276
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
whatever it was and it was just like a

277
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,440
bunch of if else if else if else if else

278
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,839
if like something like that. It looked

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,399
really ugly but I had a lot of fun doing

280
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,560
it. But in a way you're helping people

281
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,800
choose their own adventure today through

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,200
programming like gaining independence,

283
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,640
critical thinking, uh doing things that

284
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
they rely on other people to do like

285
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,560
they can do themselves. Like that's kind

286
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,160
of incredible that you do that. It's

287
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
pretty fun. That's that's what I get out

288
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,079
of it. I like I said, I don't want

289
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,480
people to become computer scientists. I

290
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,920
just want to empower them to I don't

291
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,000
know like if they want to make their own

292
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,560
app, they can totally do that using

293
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
really basic computer science skills or

294
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,800
programming skills, not necessarily

295
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,399
computer science skills, but yeah. Yeah.

296
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,640
So, uh controversial question. Uh I

297
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,440
asked you before the show a question and

298
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,200
I have not seen the answer yet but um

299
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,720
the question was um in an environment

300
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,920
when there are coding tools out there

301
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,079
that allow people to build things um

302
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,279
what's the value proposition of learning

303
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,279
a language like Python to do that? Like

304
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,040
do we still need to do it? And what's

305
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,800
the value proposition of doing it? So

306
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,560
you're going to reveal your answer. I'll

307
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,920
reveal my answer.

308
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,560
So, not sure if this exactly answers the

309
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,480
question, but I said trust, but verify.

310
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,959
Oh, tell me more. Okay. Yeah, I've

311
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,480
certainly definitely used Genaii tools

312
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,560
before. And for even for really simple

313
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,839
things, it can get it wrong, especially

314
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,160
um mathematical things and even

315
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,360
programming things. And so, I have sort

316
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,360
of a I would say a basic knowledge of

317
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,440
programming. And I Wait, I'm not ready.

318
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,000
IoT is a little more than basic for

319
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,920
everyone out there. More than basic.

320
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,360
Continue. Um, and so I was able to start

321
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,639
with what Genai gave me as a as as a

322
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,639
program and kind of kind of tell, you

323
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,279
know what, it in this particular test

324
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,240
case, it doesn't really work that well.

325
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,399
And I didn't have to go back and ask it

326
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,040
to fix it because that requires a lot

327
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,200
more sort of back and forth with the

328
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
with prompting. And I was able, you

329
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
know, to just fix it on my own. It

330
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,079
wasn't that hard of a fix. And, you

331
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,200
know, as soon as you go back and prompt

332
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
the the genai again and again and again,

333
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
you start to introduce sort of

334
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,639
variability of English language, right?

335
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,399
You're like when you're talking to

336
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,399
someone online, it's really hard to tell

337
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,279
what they mean or right, there's all

338
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,399
these double meanings. Um, and Genai is

339
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,079
all probabilistic. So they're basically

340
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,600
going to, you know, pick the highest

341
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
probability of what you mean and then

342
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,959
when they give you answers back again,

343
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
they give it to you with whatever the

344
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,240
highest probability for the next word to

345
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,760
be, that's what they spit back at you.

346
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
So as soon as you introduce sort of that

347
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,760
prompting back and forth, it can

348
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,160
introduce errors that potentially stack

349
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,399
on top of errors, misunderstandings, and

350
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,800
things like that. So having a really

351
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,880
basic knowledge of programming could

352
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,560
allow you to maybe start with a piece of

353
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
code that the Genai gives you back so

354
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
you're not starting with a blank slate.

355
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,720
It's not super daunting to write it

356
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,399
yourself, but you start with something

357
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,240
and then you potentially test it and

358
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,079
then debug it and then, you know, figure

359
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,959
it out. Okay, now I trust that it works

360
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,399
well. Yeah. I feel like the ability to

361
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,160
verify is the human component. Yes. And

362
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,399
that is sort of what creates the balance

363
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,120
with AI. Like if you let AI make all the

364
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,000
decisions, then you've lost your

365
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,040
self-reliance. Um, and you can't choose

366
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,240
your own adventure because you're going

367
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,320
to get a bunch of errors and it's going

368
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,959
to lead you down the wrong path. So, you

369
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,279
need the knowledge to be able to choose

370
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,600
um a path that makes sense. Yeah. I have

371
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,760
to know what the ducks are now. Like I I

372
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:29,040
can't continue. So, okay. And a pig. I'm

373
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,920
Is that like noisy data or just noisy

374
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,040
data? Okay. So, okay. Uh every semester

375
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,040
when we run our classes uh on intro to

376
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,839
programming and computer science, there

377
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,959
is one particular class that is on

378
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,680
debugging. Okay. which is the process of

379
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,480
okay, you wrote a piece of code and it's

380
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,480
not running as you expect it to. So how

381
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,519
do you fix it? That is the debugging

382
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,440
process. And so a a lot of times a bunch

383
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,199
of the errors might be things that you

384
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,680
can easily fix but most of the time uh

385
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,920
your program runs fine and it gives you

386
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,920
an answer but the answer is not what you

387
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,079
thought it should be. That's kind of

388
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,959
where like uh programming is kind of

389
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,079
different than like English for example

390
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,800
because in English like if you write a

391
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,279
sentence somebody else can interpret it

392
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,120
however they'd like. Like one example we

393
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,880
give to students is the chicken is ready

394
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
to eat. What do you think about when you

395
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,519
when I say the chicken is ready to eat?

396
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,000
Well I'm a vegetarian so I don't want to

397
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,000
actually eat the chicken but I would

398
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,639
like because I'm a vegetarian I assume

399
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,720
the chicken wants to eat his food. Okay,

400
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,360
there you go. But I would assume I enjoy

401
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,600
meat.

402
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,199
So, so I my uh my take on that is uh I

403
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
have a chicken on the table and I'm

404
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,120
going to eat it. Right. So, there's two

405
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,079
interpretations to that. But when we

406
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
write code, there's only one way to

407
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,040
interpret that piece of code that is

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,040
written, right? So, um, so that's where

409
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,959
things go wrong in our code because

410
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,800
we're like, well, it should work because

411
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,399
in my mind, like when I kind of thought

412
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,240
about it, it's supposed to give me the

413
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
right answer, but it doesn't, right? And

414
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,959
so, obviously, the program is the one

415
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,959
who's wrong because the computer is

416
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,720
merely following the algorithm, the set

417
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,959
of instructions, and there's only one

418
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
way to follow those instructions. That's

419
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,639
basically what that whole lecture, that

420
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,560
whole class is about. And then I bring

421
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:28,079
out this big box of ducks and I say and

422
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,199
I say, um, well, uh, programming is

423
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,759
actually kind of

424
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,240
creative

425
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,720
because the solution to a problem, I

426
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,680
mean, you could brute force a bunch of

427
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,040
things, but often times the solution to

428
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:50,000
a debugging problem is just to take time

429
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,800
away from it and then potentially

430
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,759
explain exactly what your you think the

431
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,079
code is doing to someone who knows

432
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,399
absolutely nothing about programming. It

433
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,360
could be you. Yes, I'm available. Or it

434
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,959
could be a rubber duck. Oh, so this is

435
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,880
called rubber ducky debugging. Oh,

436
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,480
because uh it's an inanimate object that

437
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,199
doesn't know anything about programming,

438
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
right? And it forces you to scrutinize

439
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
every single line of code that you

440
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,919
wrote, even ones you think are correct.

441
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,480
Um, most often it's the ones that are

442
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,160
that you think are correct that kind of

443
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,799
are are the issue. It's kind of like

444
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,799
like where did I put my glasses, right?

445
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,400
And you spend a long time looking for

446
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,320
them and they're on top of your head.

447
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,160
It's that exact feeling. It's like where

448
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
is that error coming from? And it's

449
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,840
going to be something super simple. So,

450
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,160
the rubber duck is what um helps you

451
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,559
figure that that problem out because

452
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,400
you're explaining it in very grave

453
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,400
detail to something that doesn't know.

454
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,559
And if ducks are not your thing, there

455
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,000
are frogs. Oh, and the pig pigs, of

456
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,320
course. Of course. Or friends, you want

457
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,280
to explain it to them. But friends can

458
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,919
be judgy. Friends can be judgy. Yes. So,

459
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,520
I used to explain my code to my son when

460
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,960
he was one. Yeah. Yeah. When I had

461
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,720
issues cuz he doesn't know anything

462
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,880
about programming, right? And so it's

463
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,039
the act of talking it through. But you

464
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,360
said it has to be in great detail. Yes.

465
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,360
You can't skip because that's when cuz

466
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,880
you already like clearly your code is

467
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,480
wrong

468
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,160
because of you. And and so don't skip

469
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,039
any details. Right. That's I feel like

470
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,320
this very much like life outside of

471
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,160
academia. like you 90% of the time the

472
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,559
problem is probably you you know and

473
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,039
it's like you have to figure out how to

474
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,120
interact in the world or with others. So

475
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,679
I brought all this all these ducks a

476
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,919
wide variety. So now I have a a question

477
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,640
for you. Which duck would you like to

478
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,360
keep? This is a hidden personality test.

479
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,559
Oh

480
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,720
we'll probably have to cut this because

481
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:55,679
it might take a long time. Um I would um

482
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,799
this guy. This guy. Yeah. He's a little

483
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,720
bit offbeat. Yeah.

484
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,919
Um, you know,

485
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,320
eye-catching and I feel like I could

486
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
explain stuff to him. I get to keep him.

487
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,720
Yeah, of course. Thank you. That's so

488
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,520
great. You put one for the set as well.

489
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,120
Really? Oh gosh. Does someone from the

490
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,559
crew want to like pick a duck for the

491
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,600
set? You took the one I would have

492
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,520
picked. Oh, no.

493
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,320
All right, then. Um, there's another

494
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,080
mohawk guy right over there. Yeah. Yeah,

495
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,080
we'll go two mohawks. There you go.

496
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,679
Thank you. Yeah, of course. What a gift.

497
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,679
So, you can use it for programming if

498
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,679
you decide to start or as you said in

499
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,559
even in your day-to-day life, you can if

500
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,720
you just explain the problem to Yes. You

501
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,679
know, something that doesn't judge or

502
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Yeah. Um this idea of taking a break

503
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,559
like the process of programming itself

504
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,039
seems quite intense. There's like an

505
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,919
image in popular culture of like a

506
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,840
person working alone in the dark like

507
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,640
with a hoodie and like tap tap tap. um

508
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,520
for hours on end. Like that sounds

509
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,480
intense. Um so there's two pieces like

510
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,000
is that accurate and two like do people

511
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,960
work in isolation like that or is it

512
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,919
more collaborative? Um so I tend to

513
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,720
encourage collaboration. Okay. Uh I have

514
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,679
certainly put a hoodie on and the hood

515
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,320
on in the past just like a leave me

516
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,640
alone kind of state. Uh mostly for you

517
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,880
know homework and things like that. But

518
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,240
I for for students learning to program I

519
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
definitely encourage collaboration

520
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,799
because it's when you talk to somebody

521
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,559
else you kind of see their viewpoint and

522
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,120
in programming I know I talked about

523
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,880
like an algorithm but for you know for a

524
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,440
particular algorithm or even just to

525
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,480
solve a specific problem there's a ton

526
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,799
of ways to solve it. So I learn from in

527
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,240
the classroom when students when I ask

528
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,600
students for how did they solve a

529
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,840
particular problem after I give them

530
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,159
some time to think about it they have so

531
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,480
many different approaches to it that I

532
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,159
would never have thought of and it's

533
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,480
important for students to see all these

534
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,720
different approaches because my way

535
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,720
might not be the way that they think uh

536
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
to approach the problem. So I encourage

537
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,159
kind of working together especially as

538
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,320
you're learning now after you find your

539
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,799
groove maybe it's you know not necessary

540
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,080
but yeah as an outsider to this I didn't

541
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,919
realize there was such room for

542
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,000
divergent thinking so that's really

543
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,960
cool. Yeah, but the taking a break. So,

544
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,960
especially at a place like MIT, like I

545
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,159
don't I don't know if like taking a

546
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,679
break is on the menu really. Um, but it

547
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,679
should be. I'm guessing it should be.

548
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,240
Yeah. And then I'm wondering if you can

549
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,919
talk to us about like the thing you

550
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,080
created in the world to help people take

551
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,360
a break and why it's important. Sure.

552
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,559
So, this was a project uh for I don't

553
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,760
know. I just had an idea. I was like,

554
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,440
let me just make a coloring book. um

555
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,559
like you know one of those uh coloring

556
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,640
books that you just kind of doodle in

557
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,760
into. And I thought let me just make it

558
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,080
um computer science themed. And so each

559
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,280
one of these is you know like here's a

560
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,600
circuit and it's like here's a network

561
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,240
right of connected people and then

562
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,520
here's a like a matrix kind of thing

563
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,520
right with bits.

564
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,000
So uh it was just kind of all these

565
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,880
ideas from uh computer science and the

566
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,280
hope is that if you are stuck and you

567
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,360
don't have a duck right then you can

568
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,840
take a coloring book doesn't have to be

569
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,840
this one but just something that uh

570
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,720
gives your brain a break but it's this

571
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,600
idea of mind wandering and this is an

572
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,280
idea from uh psychology where mind

573
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
wandering is not bad like if you're

574
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,880
folding laundry right you're doing a

575
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
very repetitive task

576
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
your brain doesn't have to super focus

577
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,480
on it. And so that's when inspiration

578
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,080
comes because you're kind of

579
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
subconsciously thinking about other

580
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,159
things, maybe problems that you have or,

581
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,640
you know, things that you're worried

582
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,840
about. And that's kind of when solutions

583
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,440
come. Just like, you know, when you're

584
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,520
taking a shower, that's mind wandering

585
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,960
as well because you're doing a test that

586
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,200
you already know how to do. You don't

587
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
need to dedicate any thought to it. So

588
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,520
your brain kind of dedicates thought to

589
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,679
other things that um might be worrying

590
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,640
you or on your mind. That's great that

591
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,440
you've created that. Do you feel like

592
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,200
programming

593
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,720
is like what's the percentage of logic

594
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,240
to creativity when it comes to

595
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,640
programming? Are we like 50/50, 8020?

596
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Interesting. 6040

597
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,720
maybe 50/50 I would say. I think

598
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,880
creativity comes into the process at all

599
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
the different levels. So when you're

600
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,919
coming up with a problem or something

601
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,520
that you want to solve using

602
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,039
programming, right, you have to be

603
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,720
creative like right. Um so just coming

604
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,200
up with that is mostly is creativity

605
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,760
when you're deciding how to solve the

606
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,000
problem or how to uh how to write the

607
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,080
code sort of maybe what algorithm to use

608
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,720
or how to structure it or like what

609
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,039
pieces to use and where. um that

610
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,120
requires some creativity potentially,

611
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,360
you know, putting things together that

612
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,760
you might not have put before, you know,

613
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,039
pieces of uh uh programming concepts

614
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,280
together that you might not have put

615
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,880
before. And then you're obviously going

616
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,320
to uh run into an error after you write

617
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,320
the code the first time. And so then

618
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,159
tons of creativity comes into play

619
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,960
there. Uh but you know, drawing or

620
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,559
talking to a duck. Um, I'm liking

621
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,640
programming more and more, I have to

622
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,840
say. I know once you're programming,

623
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,440
it's kind of like reading a really good

624
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,960
book. Like, you're in this zen space

625
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,640
where you're just like, "Yeah, this is

626
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,559
working." Like, I totally see where I'm

627
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,159
where this is going. Like, I know what I

628
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,000
want to write next, you know? Like, the

629
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,600
code just kind of fits together. So,

630
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,559
just like being in a good book is is

631
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,200
awesome. Wow. And then the more you

632
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,480
program, the more you want to program

633
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,799
cuz you're just gaining these skills

634
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,559
along the way. So, it's like you're like

635
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,400
I play video games, so you know, you're

636
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,279
just constantly like looking for new

637
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,799
ways to level up, but there's no cap.

638
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,279
It's uh really fascinating because

639
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,520
unlike video games, most of them like

640
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,400
you could use open-source

641
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,799
um coding languages and financial

642
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,039
barriers don't come into play to get

643
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,320
that area for growth and that like that

644
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,159
dopamine hit of like leveling up,

645
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,679
increasing your skills. It's just Yeah,

646
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,960
it's just kind of a different Like you

647
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,360
said, it's a growth mindset, right? It's

648
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
a different way of of It's a different

649
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,720
fun. It's a different fun. It's a

650
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,760
different fun. I I'm like more and more

651
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm like maybe I want to try this one.

652
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Well, oh, there's a book right here.

653
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
Get programming. Learn to code with

654
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,320
Python. Yeah. So, this I wrote a while

655
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,279
ago.

656
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,440
Um, it's a book made lots of books or

657
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,760
lots of things claim to be for

658
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,919
beginners, but I wanted to write

659
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,240
something that is actually for people

660
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
who have never programmed before. So, I

661
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,000
think we don't even get into writing

662
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,520
code to like chapter 7 or something like

663
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,440
that. It's mostly kind of just setting

664
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,679
up motivation, but not not boring like I

665
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,039
wanted it to re read like a novel,

666
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,080
right? Like you're just like, "Oh, I'm

667
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,240
just following along." Um, so if you

668
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,600
want to start, you could also, you know,

669
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,440
you could try this book. You can keep

670
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,039
this hot. Oh my gosh. I have to tell you

671
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,640
a secret. Yes. So, I requested this

672
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:17,679
through interl loan at my home library.

673
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,520
So, and I asked um one of my family

674
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,200
members to pick it up and I was like,

675
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,120
just so you know, it's really for me.

676
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,799
Like, cuz they would be like, why is she

677
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,320
getting this book? This must be the

678
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,720
wrong thing. I was like, it's not a

679
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,720
mistake. Like, it's actually for me. And

680
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,760
but I didn't really believe that, but

681
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,320
now I feel like it is for me. Oh, great.

682
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,799
Like I do want to read it now, learn.

683
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,279
Yeah, anybody can can start for sure.

684
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,120
Yeah, that's just great. Um, do you have

685
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,279
any like hot tips for newbies who might

686
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,880
um want to start or even people who are

687
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,360
like deep into programming, deep into

688
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,279
the hoodie already? Like things you're

689
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,200
interested in reading or you think other

690
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,279
people should view or listen to um to

691
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,760
start or continue their journey? Mostly

692
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,799
tip for mostly tips for newbies I would

693
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,960
say. Okay. Um don't get discouraged.

694
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,120
Learning curve is steep. Yeah. Okay.

695
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,840
Yeah. It sucks. But can I text you when

696
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,360
I Yes, you can text me. Thank you. If

697
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,679
the duck doesn't work. If the duck

698
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,039
doesn't work. Yeah. No, it's it's I

699
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,799
mean, you're learning a new language.

700
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,279
Like it's called a programming language,

701
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,200
right? And it's basically learning a new

702
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,200
way to write things that you already

703
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,440
know how to do in or how to write in

704
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,039
English. Yeah. You're just structuring

705
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,720
it structuring it in a completely

706
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,960
different way and a different language.

707
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,400
So it the learning curve is steep. But

708
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,320
don't get discouraged with Genai tools.

709
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,799
Now though it's easy

710
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,880
to get started right that's not from

711
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,799
scratch. So like I mentioned earlier, if

712
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,679
you're stuck on a problem, just ask

713
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,880
prompt it to give you a solution and

714
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,120
then work on the trust but verify

715
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,440
uh piece where you'll actually get

716
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,720
valuable experience debugging, right?

717
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,720
Because you already start with a piece

718
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
of code. So like the confidence level is

719
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
already kind of there. You're like,

720
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,600
okay, I'm not starting blank. And then

721
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,399
you can, you know, try to fix it or

722
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,559
agree that it works. And both are really

723
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,480
valuable skills to to practice as

724
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,480
beginner programmers. I love the idea of

725
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,559
starting with code and practicing

726
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,600
debugging. That feels like low stakes

727
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,520
and doable. Totally. Yeah. Um, what have

728
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I not asked you that I should have asked

729
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,760
you? I want to know what games. What

730
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,799
games? What games you play? Oh my gosh.

731
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,799
Like video games? Y I like driving a

732
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,320
lot. So I drive in the real I do not.

733
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,679
You said you don't like being stuck in

734
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,640
traffic. No, I don't like being stuck.

735
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,760
So, I like to drive. So, I also enjoy

736
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,279
driving games. Okay.

737
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,000
Not just around the track, but like

738
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,640
through random cities and things like

739
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,640
that. Escaping the police and you know,

740
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,399
like the You have a whole other side to

741
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,720
you. Me for speed.

742
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:00,720
GTA played Need for Speed. Yeah. Yeah. I

743
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,840
have the setup with the wheel and Yeah.

744
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,240
Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, thank you so much

745
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,080
for being here. I learned about myself.

746
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,960
I learned about programming. I have a

747
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,880
whole new world view on what is possible

748
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,880
with and through programming. And that's

749
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
just an incredible gift. And I'm so glad

750
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,480
we get to share that with a lot of

751
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,000
people who might also take that gift and

752
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,000
run with it. So, thank you. That's

753
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,360
awesome. Glad to hear. Thank you for the

754
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,080
chat. This was awesome. And thank you

755
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,080
for the duck. Yes.
