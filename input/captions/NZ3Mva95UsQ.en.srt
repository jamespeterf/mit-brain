1
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,720
So, uh, in the rest of the class, let's

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,279
talk a little bit, uh, about, um,

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,920
interest rates, uh, and a little bit

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:33,920
about bonds, uh, because that's very,

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,320
important for and central for many will

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,440
be will be definitely part of many

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,640
classes and is generally central for uh

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,760
for finance and for life in my opinion.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,520
So what is interest?

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,520
Um well let's start with

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,520
now

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,039
and suppose we have $1 which we uh

13
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:07,479
invested oh put it in the bank. So what

14
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,479
happens in one year?

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,360
Well you expect to get your dollar back

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,360
with some interest. And what does it

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,040
mean? So you get one plus something I

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,920
know 5% nowadays and this r is called

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,320
interest rate. So what happens if you

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,520
reinvest it what what will you get the

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,000
the whole thing? So in two years you

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,079
would expect to get

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,799
1 + r * 1 plus r right? So 1 plus r 2.

24
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,799
So in n years

25
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,479
you will expect to get

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:59,840
1 plus r to to the power m right

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,560
well let's let's make it small and small

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,360
not to confuse ourselves. So uh now

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,080
let's uh let's make life a little bit

30
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,599
more complicated. What happens if you uh

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,360
if you decide to take your money in half

32
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,239
a year,

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,280
right? You had one here. So what happens

34
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,040
in h half a year? Well, you get half of

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:30,800
the interest, right? So it will be 1 + r

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:33,760
/ 2 and in one year it will be 1 + r / 2

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
squared, right? Because re you reinvest

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:42,800
it. So suppose you you keep it in the

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,879
bank and in n years it will be 1 + r / 2

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,120
but twice n right because there are

41
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,840
twice as many periods.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:56,400
Okay let's subdivide further let's make

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:02,640
m periods. So in one in the first period

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:05,599
you get one over 1 + r / m

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:16,239
in one year it will be

46
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:19,640
1 + r / m ^ m and here you'll get 1 + r

47
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,640
/ m

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,440
* n.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,280
All right.

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,760
What if we take the limit? Let's if we

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:36,120
are able to reinvest every second, every

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,120
millisecond, what happens then? So

53
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,599
we'll send this m to the infinity.

54
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,760
So what is who knows what what is that?

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,280
>> Well, it is E but

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,959
R

57
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:11,040
>> right has to be there and N this N will

58
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:15,360
stay there right well yeah if we keep N

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,400
here. So in fact interesting historical

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,960
fact that's how E was discovered and

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:28,639
defined. It was Berni in his seinal

62
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,720
paper in uh 1683

63
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,360
where he

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,880
described this computation and it was

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,160
about interest rate uh about uh how

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,759
interest is compounding. So maybe this

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,400
was the first mathematical finance paper

68
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:51,120
in in the history.

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,880
Uh okay. Now let's change uh the uh game

70
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,040
a little bit. Not a game change the

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:01,840
question a little bit. So suppose we

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:06,440
know that we will receive uh uh we will

73
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,440
receive $1 in one year.

74
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,000
uh how much

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,160
should we pay for this right to receive

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,560
a dollar in one year? How how much

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,880
should should we pay now to receive a

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
dollar in one year, right? So, and let's

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,160
compute it. So, suppose we don't uh we

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,160
don't know. Let's let's assume that now

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,800
it is act x dollars

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,080
and let's consider the the following

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,840
strategy. Let's borrow $1. Uh let's

84
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,840
borrow X this amount

85
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,880
now and let's see what happens at the

86
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,960
end. So at the end in one year I mean

87
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,919
we'll receive $1 dollar for sure, right?

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,080
And we'll have to repay our debt but

89
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,039
with interest.

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,800
So we'll have repay

91
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,680
1

92
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,680
plus uh x * r uh uh

93
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,520
sorry x

94
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,680
* 1 + r

95
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,280
right

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,400
now

97
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,880
what should this be?

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,800
Can it be greater than zero this

99
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,520
difference?

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,319
Well, if it's greater than zero, why

101
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,560
wouldn't we borrow? Why why wouldn't we

102
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,080
buy a right to receive a billion

103
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,400
dollars? Then we'll have a lot of

104
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,120
profit.

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,280
Can it be less than zero? Well, then we

106
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,960
would be stupid to enter this contract

107
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
because we'll lose money for sure.

108
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,759
That's that's we know that this will

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,759
happen in one year. So for no arbitrage

110
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,360
and we we don't assume that anybody our

111
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,919
counterpart is stupid. We don't think

112
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,400
that we are stupid right? So it has to

113
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,520
be zero.

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:13,280
So and this x

115
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:16,800
is equal to 1 + divided by 1 plus r

116
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,720
and this is called discounting

117
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,440
meaning that if we know that we'll

118
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,280
receive certain amount in the future and

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,039
we know the interest rates pre

120
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,120
prevailing interest rates then we have

121
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:37,199
to discount the the uh the future value

122
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,680
to today using a discount factor and

123
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:45,440
this is the discount factor assuming

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:49,440
analyzed compounding. Right? If uh if we

125
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,560
if we assume analyze compounding and uh

126
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,199
receive n dollars in the future uh in

127
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,400
the future n years, right? the value of

128
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,400
n dollars in the future.

129
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,440
It is the value of our n dollars which

130
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,919
which we'll receive in the future n

131
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,440
years but it has to be discounted by n

132
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,440
years right so it it should be

133
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,240
and here it is discounting right if we

134
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,400
assume a continuous discounting

135
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,599
something like this then it will be our

136
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,440
price will be n

137
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,759
*

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,959
e to minus

139
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,719
RN right this will be our discount

140
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,839
factor

141
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,640
assuming continuous compounding

142
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,480
so and we already hitting the uh the

143
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,399
problem or not a problem but we are

144
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,839
already hitting a situation uh where uh

145
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,839
some model is needed

146
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,839
so

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,560
which brings us to the world of

148
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,560
financial interest is financial

149
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,920
instruments, interest rate related

150
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,279
financial in instruments.

151
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,880
Uh and the simplest financial instrument

152
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,320
is a zero coupon bond. That's exactly

153
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,680
the right to receive certain amount of

154
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,640
uh of notional or notional is quite

155
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:27,279
often one or 100 in certain amount of

156
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:31,200
time, right? And that's the value of our

157
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,920
zero coupon bond. More common uh

158
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,920
financial instruments are coupon bonds,

159
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,800
right? Because most people would like to

160
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,760
receive periodic interest

161
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,600
for uh for giving for lending money,

162
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,480
right? And that's effectively lending

163
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
money. And uh this is typical b uh

164
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,920
bonds. For example, if you buy

165
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,480
government bonds, that's that's what

166
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,839
will what will happen. You'll give the

167
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,399
government your $100

168
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,240
and government will be repaying you

169
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,200
coupons periodically usually semianually

170
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,200
uh here in US in Europe it's quite often

171
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,959
quarterly and the notional all your $100

172
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,640
at the end right so what what the pri a

173
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:20,399
pri the price of such a coupon bond

174
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,800
should be well we'll need to take all

175
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,360
the cash flows

176
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,600
and discount them.

177
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,600
And if we assume a constant interest

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,399
rate,

179
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,440
we'll have to discount it with our

180
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,720
constant discount factors.

181
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:43,040
And that's how uh how much and this

182
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,399
assumes well say annual coupons and

183
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,880
annual rate. So that's will be your

184
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,440
sequence with a notional at the end,

185
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,920
right? the the whole big notional at the

186
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:59,519
end. And can we sum this up?

187
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,079
Well, sure. That's geometric geometric

188
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,279
sequence, right? Everybody can sum up

189
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,600
geometric sequence. And that's

190
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,160
uh that's the value. That's what you

191
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,839
get. Uh so u and that's the value of the

192
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,440
bond.

193
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,120
Now

194
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
uh

195
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,120
the bonds are traded on the markets

196
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,720
uh there are prices of the bonds uh and

197
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,680
if you start uh investing into uh into

198
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,640
bonds and not in just in one bond you

199
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,360
should be able to compare two bonds

200
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,200
and comparing the price is not really

201
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,040
convenient

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,760
because bonds of different maturities

203
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,360
even with the same interest would will

204
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,959
have different prices, right? Because

205
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,839
there will be different number of cash

206
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:54,399
flows. Bonds of different coupons will

207
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,959
have different prices. So what turns out

208
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,160
uh to be more convenient measure to

209
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:05,519
compare bonds and various fixed income

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:09,680
securities is yield. And yield is

211
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,720
such a constant interest rate

212
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,880
which by this discounting gives you

213
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
market price. You so you you buy

214
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,279
something at the market price. You know

215
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,560
the market price. So uh you know all the

216
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,839
cash flows. So you back out one flat

217
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,440
interest rate which will give you uh the

218
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,920
price of uh of the bond. Right? That's

219
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,399
called yield of the bond. Obviously

220
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,079
there is uh onetoone relationship

221
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:43,440
between price and yield. So for our

222
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,880
zero coupon bond yield is pretty simple

223
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,079
right you just invert this uh this

224
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,160
formula and here this is here on the

225
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,160
slide for coupon bonds

226
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,399
yield computation is more complex

227
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,639
because inverting this formula is uh

228
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,440
more involved in in fact it has to be

229
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,839
numerical right but that's uh that's how

230
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:14,160
fields are computed. Um

231
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:18,800
here I'll I give you an example

232
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:22,160
of uh of a few uh of price yield

233
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,880
relationship for a 10-year bond with

234
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,880
different coupons. So what's important

235
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,240
to know here is that the higher the

236
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,440
coupon and that's natural the uh the uh

237
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,760
the higher the the yield is right for

238
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,079
the same bond of the same maturity. Uh

239
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,160
but what is important to know is the

240
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,880
yield and price are in inverse

241
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,440
relationship. The higher yield the low

242
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,079
lower the price right because it's all

243
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,959
about discounting.

244
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,560
It's in denominator. The higher the the

245
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,560
price the lower the yield.

246
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,279
Um

247
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:05,120
so uh that's that's what it is. Uh and

248
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,639
but real life is

249
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,000
uh is more complicated than that in real

250
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,199
world as if we wanted everything to be

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,519
the same simple interest rate and all

252
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,399
bonds have

253
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,120
to be discounted the same. Uh real life

254
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,320
is slightly different. So if you take

255
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,440
market uh uh securities, market bonds

256
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,760
and start baking up their yields, they

257
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,120
uh they will not be constant uh

258
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,519
particularly with maturity.

259
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,560
And this is called the yield curve. And

260
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,160
I gave you uh here I plotted a yield

261
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,959
curve

262
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:49,519
uh for uh 10-year uh term structure of

263
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,560
10-year yields,

264
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,199
US government yields for a variety of

265
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,279
times and I want to talk just a little

266
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,519
bit about it because it's quite topical.

267
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,040
So that's the the the thickest line is

268
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,240
this. That's uh the yield curve uh for

269
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,040
September 3rd. So two days uh two days

270
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:15,199
ago right? Um so quite different and

271
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,760
yields here in for a very short dated

272
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,079
securities are quite higher than for

273
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,160
longdated security. This this is still

274
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:27,120
quite atypical. For example, in 92

275
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,760
around the same September time, yield

276
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,079
curve looked like this.

277
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,360
Uh considered to be more or less

278
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:39,519
classical curve. And generally speaking,

279
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,760
we expect upward sloping curves because

280
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,560
generally speaking, people would like to

281
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,160
receive more yield for longer term uh

282
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:53,279
for longer term investments, right?

283
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:58,759
And that's what uh was the case uh in uh

284
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,759
this is what uh this is

285
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:07,600
21 uh this is uh 14

286
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,600
uh yeah nice looking curves. The only

287
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,079
difference here is that now they they

288
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,160
are ground if in 92 they were grounded

289
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:20,800
at 3% and went all the way up to seven.

290
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:25,279
Uh they those were grounded at zero and

291
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:28,720
went only to two 3%. Right now

292
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,880
interesting observation here is so where

293
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,759
uh let's look at this inverted curves. A

294
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,160
year ago it was inverted.

295
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,399
Now it is inverted.

296
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:47,360
It was inverted in 2007. Uh no, this is

297
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:52,720
20 2019 and this is 2007.

298
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:56,480
So what do do you have anything

299
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,120
in your mind? What's uh what's common

300
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,800
between 20

301
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,800
21 and 2007?

302
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,839
So

303
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,959
>> the year before recession.

304
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,400
>> Yes. Exactly. Well, 2007 the recession

305
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:18,319
was the recession, right?

306
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,559
2021 there was a recession in 2020. Even

307
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:25,679
this this this yield curve is before

308
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:28,000
COVID. So nothing was and if you look at

309
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,160
the shape of the yield curves and

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,120
recession times

311
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,000
uh well it is common analogy and there

312
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,679
there are papers on that uh how

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,080
predictive is inverted yield curve for

314
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,280
the recessions.

315
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,160
Generally it is uh assumed to be

316
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,320
predictive. So here we go we have

317
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,120
inverted heel curve. What does it tell

318
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,039
us about the future?

319
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,400
Well, that's all Fed's job to keep it uh

320
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,520
to to keep it to make it a soft landing

321
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,880
and and and for a recession not to

322
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,280
happen. And we'll see maybe it will be

323
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,880
or maybe not. But uh what what I want to

324
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,440
emphasize that there is a lot of

325
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,520
information in yield curves. uh one of

326
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,600
the lectures in the future Andrew Gston

327
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,600
he will be talking mostly about yield

328
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,360
curves and yield curve constructions and

329
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:27,280
the instruments around that so uh uh

330
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:31,039
it's very uh important piece

331
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,960
um of knowledge uh and uh yeah I I'll

332
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,520
promise you when I come back later on to

333
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
talk about black shs uh I'll I'll bring

334
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,320
this slide back and we'll see what

335
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,640
happens with with the yurf because what

336
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,679
and I can guarantee you it will look

337
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,200
different because the Fed is happening

338
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,799
the Fed meeting is happening in

339
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:54,480
September. Everybody expects uh uh the

340
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,799
yields to be cut which immediately will

341
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,480
bring the short end down. What happens

342
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,480
with the long end? I wish I knew.

343
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,520
Anyway, u that's about yield curves. Uh

344
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,440
but uh another important thing to

345
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:15,360
emphasize that no matter what

346
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,559
uh bond prices

347
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,880
are sensitive to uh to yields obviously

348
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,000
right and they are sensitive to yields

349
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,760
in nonlinear fashion. What does it mean?

350
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, it means that if you hold bonds on

351
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,840
your hands and yields change and they do

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,160
change,

353
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,080
you will your your investment will

354
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,000
change. So it's quite important to

355
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,360
understand the sensitivity of your

356
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,039
investment to uh to interest rates and

357
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,880
yields. So uh and uh and what are

358
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,120
sensitivities? Those are derivatives,

359
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,640
right? So or uh in in finance and fixed

360
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
income world they're called durations

361
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,960
because they're usually uh scaled by

362
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,679
price. So uh very important measures are

363
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,600
duration of the bond

364
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,559
which is derivative with respect with

365
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,640
respect to yield u and there for each

366
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,559
different bond and each different

367
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,160
security they will be slightly different

368
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,600
right uh and uh not only the first

369
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,080
derivative is important the second

370
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:25,120
derivative or convexity

371
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:28,960
uh is also important so um yeah and

372
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,720
that's what we'll be talking about uh

373
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,880
in in a various classes. Uh we will be

374
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,440
talking about more interesting

375
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,679
uh interest rate objects in the future

376
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,039
in particular forward rates and swaps,

377
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,200
but I'll leave it to Stefan and and

378
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:54,960
Andrew uh to to talk more about that.

379
00:20:49,200 --> 00:21:00,039
Uh that's probably all for today and any

380
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,039
questions to to any of us?

381
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,039
>> Have you done this? Have you done that

382
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,200
game before?

383
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,760
>> Uh not specifically this format. So we

384
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,039
tried before it was more open-ended. I

385
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,600
was thinking I so I think by fixing the

386
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,400
dates you don't have to make the market

387
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,400
timing decision. We already made it for

388
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
you.
