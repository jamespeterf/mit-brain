1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,679
My name is Angela Kohler and I have the

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,120
priv privilege and pleasure of chairing

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,960
the future of uh health and life

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
sciences. I do not have the pleasure of

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,680
following Sally Cornbluth because it's

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,359
always a challenge to follow Sally. But

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,439
luckily you gave the vision statement

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,160
for heels. So yeah, it's great.

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
Uh yes. So I will have the pleasure of

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
introducing three speakers who are

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
thinking about the the interface of

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,480
health and life sciences and

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
nanotechnology. And so um I think there

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,239
will be a slide that will show their

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,120
faces but we have Anna Jaglennic who is

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,760
at the Koch Institute. We have Jag Shaw

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,920
who um is from Mariah Bio and Geot

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,039
Traverso just snuck in kind of he's a

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,199
professor in mechanical um engineering.

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,760
Let's see. So, uh, Sally mentioned the

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,000
vision for heels and, um, what we're

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,879
really doing as one of the presidential,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
uh, strategic initiatives is trying to

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,600
think how we can build f build a

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,360
community with folks across campus,

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,159
including all five schools and the

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
college of computing to try to tackle

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,840
some of the most trans transformative

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,000
problems in human health. And that

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,439
includes artists, that includes uh

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
people who are thinking about ethics,

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,159
that includes our colleagues at Sloan,

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,840
but also engineers and scientists. Um uh

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,360
there's some guiding principles

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
associated with how the different

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,479
strategic initiatives that you're going

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
to hear about today. You're going to

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,040
hear about manufacturing, you're going

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,400
to again hear about life sciences,

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,000
you're going to hear about climate.

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,720
there's some guiding principles for us

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,520
and that is again trying to bring in

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,479
community trying to undertake um

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
open-source strategies there's sally I

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,119
won't repeat

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
um trying to be people focused as was

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,920
mentioned trying to develop trainees

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,880
across MIT we really want to build

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
communities um and I think also

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,479
important for this audience all the

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
strategic initiatives are thinking about

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,560
how do we engage our colleagues in

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,679
industry at the earliest stage stages

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
for partnership and collaboration. Um,

55
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,560
and then we have an institutional

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
commitment as these strategic

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,319
initiatives to work with you to try to

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,800
identify funding sources to actually

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,040
enable that research.

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,520
So on the heels side, here's sort of our

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
our pillars within heels. We're focused

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
on developing talent. So for us, that

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,400
means trying to develop um funding

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,480
sources for trainees across the board.

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
We care deeply about entrepreneurship

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,400
and trying to take our innovations from

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,560
within the institute to the wider world

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
often through new venture creation. So

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,360
we partner with the engine, we partner

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,760
with Martin Trust Center, we partner

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,440
with the Bandai Center. Um we're

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,599
particularly interested in catalyzing

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,519
discovery. I'll say more about this um

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,040
through seed grants. So we're often

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
providing seed grants to different

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
folks. I'll say more about nanocience,

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
but here are some of the topics that

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,120
have bubbled up across campus. The seeds

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
in our case really require

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,920
interdisciplinary teams, people from

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,159
different departments, different DLCIs.

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,159
And moving forward into year two, we're

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
working with industry partners to issue

84
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
grant challenges to the community. And

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,239
then from an impact perspective, we're

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,080
hoping that we can grow some of these

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
seeds that we're planting literally

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,440
today on October 1st. Our seed grants

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,280
start today um into strategic

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,959
initiatives. We have some that already

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,159
exist. I'll say a little bit about the

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,440
MIT MGB seed program and the MIT program

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,519
for um health sciences and

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,319
semiconductors.

95
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,440
So heels across uh MIT I was really

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,920
shocked when I learned that 75% of the

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,159
MIT community has already published a

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,319
paper in health and life sciences.

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,200
That's really remarkable. We're a very

100
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,560
large community spanning like I said all

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,720
the schools as of this weekend even I

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
should say heels launched on December

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,959
4th but we've really been ex in

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,120
existence for six months and as of this

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,080
weekend we uh reached the milestone of

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,920
having funded 140 different labs on

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,040
campus through a variety of mechanisms

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,319
including fellowships grants etc. And if

109
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,000
you're interested in the health and life

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,080
sciences, please mark your calendar.

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
We'll be holding an annual symposium in

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,120
March.

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,400
So, I figured I would say a little bit

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,799
about these seed grants that are

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,639
starting today. Um, I don't have cool

116
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,600
images yet because the research is

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,639
literally starting today, but of the 19

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,160
seed grants that we issued, 13 of them

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
self-identified as being in the

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,440
nanotechnology space. So just listing

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,040
some of these we have um just one on the

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,800
top is a a collaborative um project

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
thinking about mapping multi-body

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
multi-organ dynamics of the maternal

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,639
fetal system. Nanotechnology plays a

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,560
role in this and we have colleagues from

127
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,800
ECS material science BCS mechanical

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,320
engineering um and civil and

129
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,479
environmental engineering as part of

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
that team. There are a number of uh

131
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,520
projects that are associated with drug

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,440
delivery and sensing and imaging. Um so

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,759
we actually think within the se the

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,800
heels umbrella we can create a cohort of

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,160
teams that are thinking about

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,240
nanotechnology and work with nano.

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,800
Um I'll say something briefly about the

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,600
MIT MGB um seed program that's run by

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,080
Alex Jalick and Emory Brown. The goal of

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,320
this program is really to um plant seeds

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,000
with our colleagues at the local area

142
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,199
hospitals focusing on MGB. Um and uh

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,400
they issued a call thinking more about

144
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,400
uh a AI enabled diagnostics and digital

145
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
health solutions. They got 134

146
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,039
proposals. They've now narrowed it down

147
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,360
to 32 finalists. I got a peak at what

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,120
those who those finalists are and I

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
would say probably 75% of those

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,880
proposals relate to nanocience. So

151
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,120
that's really cool.

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
Um and then finally the MIT health

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,039
sciences and semiconductors program is

154
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,039
another program that I think people here

155
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,280
should know about. They uh ran their

156
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,680
first grant cycle over the summer. Their

157
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,400
strategic areas of focus are biosensing

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,199
imaging micro nanofluidics, magnetic

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,080
diagnostics and ultrasound technologies.

160
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,280
Um these projects uh require partnership

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440
with IMC to actually move forward and

162
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,800
they were able to fund four grants in

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,240
this area over the summer and they'll

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,840
have future runs as well. Um and then in

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
the spirit of entrepreneurship I'll just

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,919
say there's an upcoming grant call um

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,960
which is called the momentum grant. This

168
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,759
is co-sponsored between MIT Heels at

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,199
Climate and the Desponde Center. Um, and

170
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,720
here what we're doing is giving a little

171
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,160
bit of money for people to sort of check

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,840
the boxes on internal academic work with

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,440
the idea that this would let you know if

174
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,919
there's a there there for commercial

175
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,960
translation downstream. So these

176
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,039
applications are due October 15th. Uh,

177
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,639
we have a heels leadership team. If you

178
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
have questions, thoughts, we would love

179
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
to hear from you. There's an email

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
address. If you send us a question, I

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,800
promise you I'll get I'll get the email

182
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,720
and I'm uh happy to answer.

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Um, and with that, I'll transition to

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,479
the real show, which is the the amazing

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
science that our speakers are going to

186
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,360
talk about. Um, as as I said, we have

187
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720
Anna Jenk from um, the Koch Institute,

188
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,919
and she's going to talk about next

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,560
generation mRNA delivery powered by um,

190
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,720
predictive AI. Then we'll uh, transition

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,479
to Geot Traverso who will talk about uh,

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
engineering for extremes, nano for

193
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,039
health. And then we'll close out with

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
Jigash Shaw who is at Marai Bio. He will

195
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,039
talk about targeted lipid nanoparticles

196
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,520
for extrahypatic delivery. Once we're

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,840
done with the talks, we'll uh basically

198
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,080
sit down for panel and um take questions

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,720
from the audience. So with that, I'll uh

200
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,720
bring in uh Anna.

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,120
Well, thank you so much, Angela, and

202
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,240
really a privilege to be here today and

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,560
talk um with all of you. Hopefully um my

204
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,599
slides will work um because I'm not sure

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,960
how to give a data talk slides. Um

206
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,759
excellent. Um

207
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,919
so I want to u talk a little bit about

208
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,840
um kind of our health care and medicine

209
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,560
how it's really changed over the last 30

210
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,039
plus years. I think we've really um

211
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,840
transitioned from treating illness when

212
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,520
it occurs um sort of when you're you

213
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,280
know bleeding you go to the hospital and

214
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,360
you get treatment to really thinking

215
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,039
about how can we prevent illness from

216
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,080
happening in the first place and I think

217
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,639
it it sort of started in the 90s and has

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,800
really I think expanded greatly in the

219
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,400
last 10 years or so and I think part of

220
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
the things that have made this possible

221
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,880
is not just advancements in

222
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,279
biotechnology and science um but also

223
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,039
personalized and digital health um that

224
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,959
allows and really information that

225
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,959
allows all of us to really understand

226
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,039
disease progression and understand

227
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,200
things that we can do to prevent it from

228
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,320
happening. Uh nutrition and microbiome

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,320
science also is a big part of that. So

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,040
there are many tools that we use for

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,279
this and I think we're all um familiar

232
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
with things like vaccines. I want to

233
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,000
highlight one thing and you know um work

234
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
at the cancer institute about 13% of

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,839
cancers are actually caused by

236
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,320
infectious disease and some of which can

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,080
be prevented with vaccines. HPV is a

238
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,959
great example and I'll talk about that a

239
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,320
little more in a in a second. HPV is a

240
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,360
virus that um uh infectious disease that

241
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,680
leads to cervical cancer in women. Um of

242
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,320
course early dete uh cancer interception

243
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,560
is very common. We all have screenings

244
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,920
um whether it's through imaging or other

245
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,680
um Gio may talk about um colonoscopies

246
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,519
later but but there's many different

247
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,600
ways to screen for that and of course

248
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,920
nutrition metabolic health is extremely

249
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,920
becoming extremely important and I think

250
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,160
we all understand why this is important

251
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,480
it can reduce health care costs but most

252
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,600
importantly we can have healthier better

253
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,240
lives and longer lives as well and so

254
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,880
just to go back quickly to the HPV

255
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,800
example um we know that um HPV causes

256
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,680
cervical cancer and we know that

257
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,279
vaccines now we have data from the CDC

258
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,080
that show that the vaccines that were

259
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,399
developed against HPV can help prevent

260
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,320
that cancer from occurring which I think

261
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,320
is really um a huge um finding but but

262
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,440
the issue still remains as you can see

263
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,920
in the graph here that um we're not

264
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,640
immunizing uh not everyone is getting

265
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,040
those immunizations um and there's still

266
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,880
quite a bit of people that might be not

267
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
protected against this disease. It's

268
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,120
actually if you're HIV positive, it can

269
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,120
be worse. Um so, so what I've spent my

270
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,000
effort really is trying to understand

271
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,680
what are um some of the challenges that

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,079
persist there and globally there's

273
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,480
estimates that go up to as high as 40%

274
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,160
of people who start multid-dosese

275
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
vaccinations don't complete them, which

276
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,040
means they're not protected. Um and even

277
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,440
in when we look at cancer therapeutic

278
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,800
vaccines which we all know might be the

279
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,920
next um great uh imunotherapy to treat

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,399
cancer um oncology patients also drop

281
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,720
out and as low as 50% um do not adhere

282
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,959
to their full dosing regimen. So there's

283
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,959
really a huge need to make these things

284
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,920
easier for people to get the therapies

285
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,160
that could really be lifechanging. Um,

286
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,480
and so I've devoted a big part of my

287
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,839
career in trying to address these

288
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
issues. Of course, there's societal

289
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,600
issues, but really from the technology

290
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,440
standpoint. Is there a way for us to

291
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,760
lower the bar for people to get these

292
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,360
therapies? Um, and I certainly do a lot

293
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,360
of work in the global health space and

294
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
collaborate with the Gates Foundation.

295
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
And um, in those cases, we're talking

296
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,800
about low to middle inome countries that

297
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
don't have the infrastructure we have

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
here. But also in the United States,

299
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,360
there are areas once you go outside of

300
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,279
Boston and big city centers that are

301
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
rural and that just don't have the same

302
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,880
infrastructure. I think sometimes we

303
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
take for granted that we live in an area

304
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,600
with some of the best um hospitals and

305
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,279
medical care in the world. And so those

306
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,079
people may not have access to many of

307
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,560
the therapies as well. So our group

308
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,120
really tries to develop um new

309
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,160
technologies and new manufacturing to

310
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,399
improve access and delivery of both

311
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,639
preventative and therapeutic medicines

312
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,600
for people across the globe including

313
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,839
here. Um we also do a lot of work um in

314
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
the area of microlastics

315
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,000
um and um micronutrients and nutrition.

316
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,279
But today I'm going to focus on um the

317
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,680
the two platforms that we developed um

318
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:28,240
for um one to um extend the efficacy and

319
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,880
durability of vaccines um or

320
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,120
therapeutics um and two to make the ease

321
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,440
of administration easier. So the first

322
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,399
quickly I just want to talk a briefly

323
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,360
about um how we developed what we called

324
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,600
our seal platform and really the idea

325
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,800
here was can we develop a single

326
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,720
injection formulation that uh for

327
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,720
vaccines that are self- boosting so you

328
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
don't need to have the repeated shots so

329
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,959
this can have improved efficacy and it

330
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,200
can be durable from that one single

331
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,959
injection and the idea is as you know

332
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,959
there's many different vaccines now we

333
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,720
have the mRNA LMP vaccines which I'll

334
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,240
get to in a minute But there's different

335
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,320
types of vaccines, different type of

336
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,600
molecules that need to deliver. And so

337
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,200
we decided um that we wanted a platform

338
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,839
solution, one that could be applied

339
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,480
across the different u modalities of

340
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,079
vaccines or molecules. Um and actually

341
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,680
as uh professor Bulovich um echoed to

342
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,920
sort of echo what professor Bulerich

343
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,120
said earlier um we ended up really

344
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,519
looking at the semiconductor uh industry

345
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,839
um and how they can package things in

346
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,920
tiny little things um because we wanted

347
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,480
to essentially build a tiny little cup

348
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,000
that could take any drug and could be

349
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
injected and delivered and then it

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,680
releases that drug at some point in time

351
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,800
after it's injected. Um the nano lab was

352
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,240
just um instrumental in helping us

353
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,800
develop this technology. There's

354
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,959
actually a dirty room where they let us

355
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,959
play around uh with various things to

356
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,680
make this work. We ended up publishing

357
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,320
this work um in in science. And really

358
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,600
what we did is until now until that

359
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,560
point, this was in 2017, the um pulse

360
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,399
the drug delivery field really with um

361
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,440
the drugs that were to be delivered were

362
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,199
usually for long-term delivery were um

363
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,279
placed in these matrices and the drug

364
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,600
was throughout the matrix that limited

365
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,079
the type of control you can have with

366
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,800
regard to drug kinetics. In the case of

367
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:27,360
vaccines, you need the vaccine to be um

368
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,360
stable and then released months after

369
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,360
you inject it. And so to really have

370
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
that kind of precision and control over

371
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,360
the kinetics, we went to a core shell

372
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,920
structure. We wanted to design a core

373
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,839
shell structure just like an egg um has

374
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
a shell on it and the egg is stable, but

375
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
once the shell breaks, it comes out very

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
quickly as we all know. So that was

377
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,959
really what we wanted to create but at a

378
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,600
scale so tiny that could be injected

379
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,680
with a regular needle and syringe. Um

380
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,360
and so it was very difficult to do this.

381
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,880
We failed for those students in the

382
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,000
audience. We failed many many many

383
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,320
times. Um but eventually we created this

384
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,199
new manufacturing process. It was almost

385
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,320
a new way of 3D printing where we can

386
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,959
make these bases um that are made out of

387
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,199
material medically approved material um

388
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,959
and then we use PZO electric nozzles

389
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,040
which are found in inkjet printers to

390
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,279
fill it with any drug or vaccine you can

391
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,199
imagine um and then we seal these

392
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,639
particles. So we created this core shell

393
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,720
structure where the drug is in the

394
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,199
center and it's stable until that shell

395
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,680
breaks just like an egg. Um and we were

396
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,920
able to achieve this using the MIT nano

397
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,839
facilities. Um, and today we have a

398
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,639
company that's now scaling this process.

399
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,199
And if you can see this little um, a

400
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,279
3-in wafer has about 7,000 of those

401
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,000
particles in it. So, we really took

402
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,839
something that you can do in micro

403
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
electronics and semiconductor industry

404
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
and brought it to the pharmaceutical

405
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,959
industry. And this allows you for these

406
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,639
very precise kinetics. Um, we and this

407
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,120
is just what the particles look like.

408
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,040
You have an SEM on the bottom. Um and

409
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,959
you can make these with high fidelity in

410
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,880
these large arrays. So it's really a

411
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,560
beautifully manufactured process just

412
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,560
like you have in the semiconductor

413
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,880
industry. Um and but most importantly

414
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,279
we're able to these each vertical line

415
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,560
here in this graph shows invivo release

416
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,320
of the drug inside or vaccine after it's

417
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,880
injected. And you can see we can not

418
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
only release days after injection but

419
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
months. That last one on the right is

420
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,279
six months out. And the way we can do

421
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,519
this is the material of the shell is

422
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,519
from PLGA polymer which is a polymer

423
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
used uh in the medical industry as

424
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,480
resorbable sutures as screws. It's used

425
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,360
in some drug formulations. So it's has a

426
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,759
huge record of safety. Um and we can so

427
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
we can tailor this release um to

428
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,320
whatever is needed and we can mix and

429
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,160
match these particles. Um, there's a lot

430
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,920
of data I could show, but I just want to

431
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,759
highlight that we've shown that we could

432
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,839
use these particles from a single

433
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
injection to deliver three doses of the

434
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
polio vaccine. We've shown that in

435
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,320
non-human private primates, you can get

436
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,600
protective titers. Um, and we've shown

437
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
we could do this for many different

438
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,480
types of vaccines. hepatitis B which is

439
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,439
a recombinant protein vaccine um

440
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,520
influenza and of course mRNA um COVID

441
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,720
vaccines and I'll get to that later but

442
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,039
hepatitis B and polio virus vaccines um

443
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
have completed non-human primate studies

444
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,480
we've also shown that you could use this

445
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,559
technology

446
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,120
to treat other diseases you could use

447
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,520
this for cancer immunotherapy drugs we

448
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,799
have um again all published data we

449
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,600
published in science translational

450
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,679
medicine um you can use it as photo and

451
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,480
chemotherapy drugs to treat metastatic

452
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,960
cancers. Um, and also you can also um

453
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
use it to leave drugs behind after open

454
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,880
heart surgery on the heart to help the

455
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,919
heart tissue uh regenerate. This was

456
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,320
just accepted to sell biomeaterials. Um,

457
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,320
and so we've shown that we can do all

458
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,840
these really beautiful things to extend

459
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
the durability from that single

460
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,000
injection, single time of contact with

461
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,559
the patient. The other thing that we're

462
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,039
really interested in um is really to

463
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,760
make the ease of administration of drugs

464
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,520
and vaccines easier. Um and for that we

465
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,720
went to micro needle technology. And I

466
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,280
don't know if those of you that are

467
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,840
familiar with micro needles are kind of

468
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,640
a bed of nails um a little band-aid that

469
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,160
you can pre uh press into the skin and

470
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
releases the drug in the tips. It's

471
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,760
actually made from sugars. Um, and as we

472
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
know during the the COVID pandemic,

473
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,440
there was really an issue with

474
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,760
delivering the vaccines, the storage and

475
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
so on. These little micro needles are in

476
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,480
solid format and they don't need to be

477
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,280
refrigerated. So, they're easy to um

478
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,880
handle and you know, here's one for

479
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,640
those you probably can't even see it.

480
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,320
And that could administer your dose of

481
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,400
vaccine or any other um drug if that's

482
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,799
the case. Uh, and you can just press it

483
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,559
onto your skin. Um, and so what we did

484
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,799
is we designed and built these three

485
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,960
three-dimensional printers that could be

486
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,720
shipped basically around the world to it

487
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,480
doesn't even have to be a pharmacy. So

488
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,280
it could be shipped around the world and

489
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,200
the ink contains the vaccine um as well

490
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,039
as the material to make the micro

491
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
needles and so they could be made on

492
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,679
demand. Um, for that we had to come up

493
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,919
with a new manufacturing process to fit

494
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,600
it into a box which you see there in the

495
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,520
center if you look there's a centurfuge

496
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
free mold filling. So we were able to

497
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,280
build that into these printers and you

498
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,400
can again build these arrays of these

499
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,919
micro needles that can be delivered. Um

500
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
we then I'm not going into all the

501
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,679
detail this was published in nature bio

502
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
technology for the sake of time but

503
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,360
we've shown that these are a lot more

504
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,840
stable at room temperature. Um they

505
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,480
contained mRNA L&P vaccines. We did this

506
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,240
work during COVID. Um and we showed that

507
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,960
much more stable at room temperature

508
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,200
than the conventional vaccines that are

509
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,120
in liquid format for in fact we had six

510
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,720
months stability at at room temperature

511
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,280
with these solid state formulations. Um

512
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,240
so to to just sort of the but the

513
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,280
challenge remained in for us to create

514
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,840
these we had to develop a new L&P a new

515
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,840
nanoparticle that was stable under these

516
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,520
conditions. there's a has to survive the

517
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,160
manufacturing process which involves

518
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,919
drying and then it has to be stable in

519
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,600
storage conditions and in the first

520
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,360
technologies has to be stable in the

521
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,360
body for a long time as well. So um my

522
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,080
students got a little frustrated in

523
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,160
posttos in trying to formulate some of

524
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,760
these things. Uh and like I said, we had

525
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,600
this really great formulation, but what

526
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
we what we wanted after all this work

527
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,520
was done, people called us and they want

528
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,159
us to work with some of the clinically

529
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,919
approved vaccines um and formulations

530
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,159
from uh companies like Madna and Fizer.

531
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,840
And what we found is that the Madna and

532
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,760
Fiser LMPS when they go through our

533
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,799
processes for these two technologies,

534
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,640
they don't survive. Um and so we had to

535
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,760
really think of this from a formulation

536
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,039
perspective. Um and so we developed in

537
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,000
collaboration with professor uh Mina

538
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,360
Konakovich um at the at uh the computer

539
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,480
science department. Um we created a a

540
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,880
machine learning accelerated um program

541
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,960
that allow us to really test all these

542
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
different formulations. Um and this is

543
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
an example what it what it did. It would

544
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,320
tell us what exipients to test. We had a

545
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,559
in a small 96 well plate. we would dry

546
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,240
the samples um and see which ones

547
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,760
survived and we'd feed that information

548
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,520
back into the algorithm um and this then

549
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,280
once we had the lead formulations we

550
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,440
would then test them in our devices and

551
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,120
eventually in animals and so very

552
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,440
quickly again we worked with Madna and

553
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,480
Fiser vaccines and this really shows you

554
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,799
the progress of our optimization

555
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
algorithm and the various rounds that we

556
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,480
tested at the top there shows you the

557
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
various round our target was to reach

558
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,880
100% stability compared to the liquid

559
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,760
formulation The bottom shows you the

560
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,520
various compositions that we tested. Um

561
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,000
and you can see after six rounds it's

562
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,960
not a linear process but we reached um

563
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,360
100%. Um again we characterized these

564
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,200
various aspects and I'm happy to I sake

565
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,600
of time I can't go into it but we can

566
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,360
talk afterwards. Um and then we tested

567
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,760
is in two models. one, we went to the

568
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,720
mouse model and we validated that in

569
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,480
fact the AI assisted formulation ended

570
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,960
up performing just as good as the um the

571
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,559
regular injectable vaccine. Um so it

572
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,919
really validated that this works in a

573
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,280
mouse and of course a lot of things work

574
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,600
in the mouse. So um and again just more

575
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,440
data reiterating that. So we then we

576
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,600
went to non-human primate model to see

577
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,679
if it works there which is closer to

578
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,720
human as we all know and again we had

579
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,360
these brilliant results that showed that

580
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,360
you get the exact same immune responses

581
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,000
whe if you use the solid state

582
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,159
formulations with the AI optimized um

583
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,280
formulation versus the liquid stuff that

584
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,960
you can get from Madna or Fizer. Um so

585
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,000
this was really thrilling but what I

586
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,159
wanted to end on here and highlight that

587
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,520
um the development timeline of AI

588
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,000
assisted uh map formulation was really

589
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,120
tremendously shorter than anything else

590
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,440
we've done. So first we started um doing

591
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,400
this process manually. It took over four

592
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,679
months. We explored a hundred different

593
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,600
exipients and no formulations matched.

594
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,320
So we failed after four months. We

595
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,720
failed and could not have uh formulation

596
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,240
that worked as well as it needed to. And

597
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,440
so um then we decided to try a different

598
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,919
approach and started using the AI um

599
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
implemented the AI model uh and within

600
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
less than a month we had our lead

601
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,520
formulation which I just showed data

602
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,799
for. Um and then after that we went into

603
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,559
rodents and finally NHPS. So um with

604
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,480
that I just want to emphasize how

605
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,039
powerful some of these tools are that we

606
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,200
have in accelerating our progress and

607
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,440
then I also want to highlight how great

608
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,360
MIT Nano has been to us. It's really

609
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,919
allowed us to innovate in so many

610
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,799
different spaces and really bring this

611
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,360
semiconductor micro electronics aspect

612
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,760
into the pharmaceutical um space and

613
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,840
really to advance uh health care for for

614
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,840
global health. And then most importantly

615
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,200
I want to thank our really terrific

616
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,000
terrific staff and of scientists in

617
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,480
particular the work I show today um Jimi

618
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,360
and Khan uh Jim is a graduate student

619
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,200
core six and Khan is a postoc in our lab

620
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,520
who really have been tremendous in in

621
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,600
doing a lot of this work and of course

622
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,440
all of our funding agencies as well

623
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,400
including the gates foundation in barta.

624
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,400
So with that, I thank you.

625
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,440
All right. Um, let me see if our slides

626
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,400
are

627
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,400
I see them on the screen.

628
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,159
All right. Well, uh, wonderful to meet

629
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,520
you. I'm Gio Traverso. As you heard

630
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,799
earlier, I'm in the department of

631
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,640
mechanical engineering. I'm also a

632
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,200
gastronurologist and I practice across

633
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
the river over at the Bighgam. And what

634
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I'd like to do over the next 10 minutes

635
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,480
or so is share with you three recent

636
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,240
stories really speaking to the nano sort

637
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,159
of aspect and how it relates to health

638
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,120
but really across length scales. And so

639
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,520
with that uh let's dive right in and you

640
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,760
know we tend to focus on the GI tract um

641
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,000
and hence the the the picture of the uh

642
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,360
pill. So the first body of work is work

643
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,720
that was led by two incredible

644
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,120
post-docctoral scientists in our group

645
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,440
Alvin Chan and Amea Curtine who are now

646
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,080
faculty members at uh in Singapore at

647
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,880
NTU as well as in Minnesota respectively

648
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,799
and the challenge that they took on was

649
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,840
really thinking about how to accelerate

650
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,240
the development of nano particles for

651
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,480
delivery of nucleic acids including mRNA

652
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,760
and others. And this is work that has

653
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,600
been supported by several bodies

654
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,159
including art by age as well as the

655
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,200
marble center here um as well as uh the

656
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,400
Singaporean government. And the you know

657
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,559
how we refer to this system is as comet

658
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,880
and uh in that it is a transformer-based

659
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,640
model that really helps accelerate the

660
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,640
whole development process. But let me

661
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,000
just take a step back for a second and

662
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,960
remind you of the challenge that we have

663
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,200
in front of us. So mRNA is a nucleic

664
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,679
acid. If one injects nucleic this

665
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,400
nucleic acid into the body it is unable

666
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,440
to be taken up by cells usually andor

667
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,679
degrades fairly rapidly and so somehow

668
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,159
we need some help from a lipid nanop

669
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,000
particle and that carrier or vehicle is

670
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,200
what enables essentially entry into the

671
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,760
cell traditional L&PS are composed of a

672
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,440
set of ingredients and so here we have

673
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,200
some of the more common ingredients

674
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,840
there's an ionizable lipid a helper

675
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,640
lipid a pegbased lipid and cholesterol

676
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,919
and very fine sort of changes in the

677
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,640
ratios of each have incredible effects

678
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,320
on the ability of that nanop particle to

679
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,039
enter the cell or even to target

680
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,440
different parts of the body. And so

681
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,679
recognizing that you know there's this

682
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,919
tremendous sort of impact on both

683
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,159
delivery but also the site of delivery.

684
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,559
uh what uh Alvin and Amaya and the team

685
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,360
decided to do was initially build a very

686
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,320
large set of experimental formulations,

687
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,799
test them and then use that data to then

688
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,400
train a transformer-based model that

689
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,880
really could treat each individual

690
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,720
component on its own but then use that

691
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
framework to then help accelerate the

692
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,320
next step. And so uh they were

693
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
successful in doing this. This paper

694
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
just came out in nature nano just a few

695
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,279
months ago. And this is just to give you

696
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,200
a flavor of the kind of things that one

697
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,799
is able to achieve very quickly through

698
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,039
these encilicoerated kind of

699
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,039
formulations. So I include here data

700
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,360
from the rodent work and we have in

701
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,840
green the clinical benchmarks and then

702
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,440
in the light blue the level of

703
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,760
expression of the amount of protein that

704
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,480
is produced in vivo and what we're

705
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,799
seeing there are improvements that are

706
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,880
greater than five to 40fold above the

707
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,480
clinical benchmarks. But now we have the

708
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,559
ability to very quickly arrive

709
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,880
essentially at the answer by using that

710
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,240
framework. Now I'm going to shift gears

711
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,640
a little bit. I'm going to go now to the

712
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,400
macro, but you'll see how macro enables

713
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,159
and actually works together with a nano.

714
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,000
And this is work that we've been doing

715
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,679
now for about a decade. And we've had

716
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
collaboration with Novonortis, the NIH,

717
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,880
but also ARPH. There have been many

718
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,039
people involved and these are some of

719
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,039
our students and collaborators uh over

720
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,600
this journey. And the fundamental

721
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,760
challenge here that we were tackling is

722
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,919
the recognition that most people if they

723
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,520
have to take a drug would rather take it

724
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,840
through the root or the system that is

725
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,159
shown here on the right a capsule over

726
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,919
the injectable format here on the left.

727
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,279
Now the challenge of course is that many

728
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,200
drugs like insulin or humra or even mRNA

729
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,360
vaccines is that they are degraded in

730
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,440
the GI tract and that's because our GI

731
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,600
tract has evolved to degrade these

732
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,600
materials. Many of our foods are made of

733
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,480
proteins and nucleic acids and you know

734
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,480
we've evolved to degrade these but also

735
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,559
these molecules are so big that they're

736
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,760
unable to essentially transport or

737
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:48,240
travel across the GI mucosa. And so what

738
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,120
we um did really inspired by uh in this

739
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,799
case by sephalopod squid was think about

740
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,159
systems that could use jets to really

741
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,600
facilitate that injection. And we had

742
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,120
done a lot of early work using different

743
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
tiny little needles. But we said you

744
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,960
know maybe we can eliminate needles uh

745
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,880
from this process. And um someone can

746
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
click on the screen. Perfect. Thanks.

747
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,840
And so what we did was we developed a

748
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,480
family of devices that facilitated

749
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,480
delivery of these jets and these jets

750
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,880
essentially carry nano particles through

751
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,679
the tissue and then these are able to

752
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,840
distribute to generate the therapy that

753
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
is intended for the specific condition.

754
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,720
And so having developed a family of

755
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,279
devices uh let me just show you uh what

756
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,159
this looks like. So this is one of those

757
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,559
uh sets of devices. Uh essentially they

758
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,720
use a jet and what you'll see here is

759
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,960
essentially that jet sort of delivering

760
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,559
that stream of nanoparticles. In this

761
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,559
case this is on the bench but this also

762
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,559
happens in vivo. And to show you what

763
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,279
happens in vivo here we have

764
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,200
cross-sectional imaging of delivery in

765
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,279
different parts of the GI tract in this

766
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,520
case of a pig. But what we were able to

767
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,240
do was quantify the fundamental uh

768
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,080
pressures required to really inform the

769
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,320
optimal delivery parameters in different

770
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,480
parts of the GI tract. So having

771
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,080
established all of this, we looked at a

772
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,919
few different therapies that typically

773
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,399
are not administerable through the oral

774
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,159
route. We looked at for example GLP1

775
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,480
receptor analoges, but now we're

776
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,880
achieving bioavailabilities or levels

777
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,600
that are comparable to an injection. So

778
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,080
there is an oral semaglutide on the

779
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,840
market. that bioavailability is 1 to 2%

780
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,559
in that formulation. Here we're

781
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,399
achieving 50 to 90% bioavailabilities

782
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,559
that are comparable to subcutaneous

783
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,200
administration. We also demonstrated the

784
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,600
ability to deliver sirna using these

785
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,120
systems. So I'm going to transition I

786
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,320
should say that that body of work was

787
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,720
just published at the end of last year

788
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,480
in nature and then this uh body of work

789
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,240
that's been supported by our page and

790
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,640
the Gates Foundation and led by an

791
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,760
extremely talented uh scientist in our

792
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,840
group Troy Kang really set out to tackle

793
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,520
a fundamental challenge of initially

794
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,880
adhesion or engagement with wet

795
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,640
surfaces. So certainly I think we

796
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,720
recognize that on the wearable side, but

797
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,520
this is a big problem in the GI tract

798
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,520
where we have a wet moist system or

799
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,760
surface that is turning over on a

800
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,360
regular basis. And so we said, well,

801
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,039
maybe we can look at nature for

802
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,120
inspiration. And uh essentially what

803
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,520
Troy did together with our collaborators

804
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,760
was look at a fish or or a family of

805
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,919
fish called raora or sucker fish. And

806
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,240
these are fish that essentially are able

807
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,320
to adhere to many substrates. And so on

808
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,240
the right of the slide, you can see uh

809
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,000
the range of substrates, right, in the

810
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,480
form of whether it's a shark or a

811
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,799
turtle. And these fish have evolved to

812
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,559
adhere to these different surfaces. And

813
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,120
so we said, you know, maybe there are

814
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,440
some lessons that we can take from this

815
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,120
evolutionary experiment. And if I hope

816
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
you can appreciate there the sucker that

817
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,080
has been highlighted. Um essentially you

818
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,840
can see that there are a lot of

819
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,480
similarities even though the substrates

820
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,840
are actually quite different. And so uh

821
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,039
what Troy together with our

822
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,240
collaborators did, we were able to get

823
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,559
Raora and study essentially the sucker

824
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,960
system to really understand how this

825
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,919
system can integrate and facilitate that

826
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,840
engagement with the mucosa. Um we also

827
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,960
filmed them. So we collaborated with a

828
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,640
group at uh BC and we were able to film

829
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,960
the engagement with synthetic sort of

830
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,120
gastric tissue to really understand the

831
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,679
steps involved in how this sucker fish

832
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,840
can engage with the surface and studied

833
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,519
and really delineated all the individual

834
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,000
steps of that process and developed a

835
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,440
synthetic remora capsule that can do all

836
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,120
of this. And so uh we demonstrated that

837
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,519
not only could we do this but we could

838
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,480
recapitulate that adhesive system. And

839
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,720
this is of course at the macro uh scale.

840
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,880
And what this system allows is

841
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,760
essentially you can administer this and

842
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,919
the natural paristoic motion in the GI

843
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
tract essentially is acting really to

844
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,440
help with the engagement with the

845
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,880
mucosa. So you'll see here there's a

846
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,679
contraction in the esophagus and then

847
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,640
the system is adherent to the GI tract.

848
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,880
Now this is where nano comes into the uh

849
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,480
the conversation where now we have a

850
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,320
macro structure enabling that

851
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,159
juxtaposition of the device with the

852
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,399
tissue or the side of the delivery and

853
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,720
now we're able to load these devices

854
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,960
with nano formulations in this initial

855
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,519
example of an anti-retroviral for the

856
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,080
treatment of HIV where we're able to now

857
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,799
support treatment orally for once with a

858
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,840
once a week capsule and beyond that

859
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,960
we've also delivered mRNA using uh these

860
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,480
systems. So, similar to some of the

861
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,919
things you just heard from Anna, we've

862
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,360
developed some solid formulations that

863
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,440
we're able to immobilize on these

864
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,559
systems. And not only are we able to

865
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,880
immobilize them, but we're able to

866
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,679
achieve uh delivery and functional

867
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,039
expression in pigs using these systems.

868
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,200
So, hopefully it gives you a little bit

869
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,039
of the flavor of what we're doing in

870
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,679
nano and bridging some of the medical

871
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,440
device macro sort of aspects and how we

872
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,840
are at least reimagining what we can do

873
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,440
for patients. I want to thank the work

874
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,440
of many and these are some of the folks

875
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,360
and their families at our recent uh

876
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,360
celebration on one of the Boston

877
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,120
islands. And with that, uh in case I

878
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,960
don't get to your questions, uh here's

879
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,399
my email. I want to acknowledge all of

880
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,640
our incredible institutions, but of

881
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,320
course all of the funders and sponsors

882
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,960
that really enable and support our work.

883
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,960
So, thank you so much.

884
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,440
So uh while my slides are coming up uh I

885
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:23,839
put in the fact that I'm of you PhD 999.

886
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,720
So uh uh uh but uh spent some time at uh

887
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,879
institution up the way uh then

888
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,240
transitioned into industry. So, one of

889
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,440
the through lines that I'll take

890
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,520
advantage of of what Anna and and Gio um

891
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,159
uh talked about was the idea that we can

892
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,119
deliver mRNA, which is the language of

893
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,200
the cell to reprogram cells. We can get

894
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,679
them to make vaccines so that they can

895
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,440
present antigens so that we can generate

896
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,520
an immune response. But we can also get

897
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,000
them to reprogram in a variety of

898
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,000
different ways including if you're

899
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,040
familiar with cartis cells so that cell

900
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,520
the cart cells can go and kill uh uh

901
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,480
cancer. So I'm going to give you a

902
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,440
flavor for how we're trying to get to

903
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,359
these other cell other cell types using

904
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,480
lipid nanoparticle technology that was

905
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,200
leveraged during the uh uh pandemic. So

906
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,280
Marai is actually a flagship company and

907
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
I'll give you a bit of a flavor of our

908
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,440
business model first. We do not make our

909
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,760
own therapeutics. We are a foundry of

910
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,760
sorts. We generate targeted lipid nanop

911
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,440
particles that go to a variety of sites

912
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,240
that I'll describe and try to identify

913
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,560
partners that have therapeutic cargos or

914
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,880
therapeutic hypotheses that would then

915
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,680
leverage our ability to be able to get

916
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,560
to those sites. So our work is really

917
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,040
very broad in the context of trying to

918
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,760
get our nanoparticles to a variety of

919
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,560
different tissues and then enable uh

920
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,240
therapeutics for for the next stage. Our

921
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,400
model is really built on um another

922
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,000
through line here is AI and the use of

923
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,880
those tools. But lipid nanoparticles as

924
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,280
geo described is a chemistry game right

925
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,200
now. It's really understanding what kind

926
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,640
of ionizable lipids which are thought to

927
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,480
be the lynch pin of the um nanoparticle

928
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,040
but also other components that can be

929
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,839
put together and then screened at scale.

930
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,480
So how do we screen them at scale? So

931
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,040
part of what we've developed at um Marai

932
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,280
is a micrfluidic technology that allows

933
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,240
us to make large numbers of different

934
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,800
L&P formulations all at once and then be

935
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,599
able to put many of those into an animal

936
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
into a single animal and then deconvolve

937
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,680
and multiplex where each one of these

938
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,599
formulations has gone and it'll be a

939
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,000
technology that many of you be familiar

940
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,920
with a barcoding technology that allows

941
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,560
us to not understand just where the

942
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,520
nanoparticle went but as you saw in

943
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,599
Geo's uh animation where it actually

944
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,839
delivered to the cell. So where it

945
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,560
actually got out of the endoome which I

946
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,040
think of as the lipid nanoparticle gel

947
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,320
of the cell how can escape so that it

948
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,320
can have therapeutic effect.

949
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,320
One of the other when we carry out those

950
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,880
invivo multiplexing we generate a lot of

951
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,839
data that data allows us then to refine

952
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,839
where our nanoparticles can go and this

953
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,400
is where the active learning based

954
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,920
approaches based on this invivo data has

955
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,839
really um dramatically increased our uh

956
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,079
potential for getting to cells of

957
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,480
interest. We're a part of the flagship

958
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,839
ecosystem and leveraging that allows us

959
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,920
to also look at things like binders. So

960
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,400
once you can get a nanoparticle to go

961
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,640
there by chemistry, don't forget about

962
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
biology. Biology has binders and

963
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,480
antibodies that can actually even

964
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,720
increase the level of potency. So we're

965
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,040
bringing those two technologies together

966
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,480
to be able to get high potency delivery

967
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,800
to cell types of interest. And I think

968
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,480
we've heard a lot about scale here and

969
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,720
you know being able to do something at

970
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,400
the benchtop being able to do something

971
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,240
in mice really does ultimately is just

972
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,720
the aperture that you need to open up to

973
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,280
be able to get to pre-clinical studies

974
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,280
and monkeys but also into human beings.

975
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,200
So how do we make sure that we can scale

976
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,160
that material in the context of clinical

977
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,079
and commercial production GMP quality

978
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,480
and that's where we have some

979
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,280
partnerships with our industry partners

980
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,359
like thermo um there we've been able to

981
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,240
now take our partners all the way from

982
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,240
the discovery element all the way to

983
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,680
clinical evaluation and hopefully their

984
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
success that would result in

985
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,320
commercialization.

986
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,760
So I'm going to talk about the elements

987
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,520
of the platform that we've built and

988
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,520
then give you an example of how we've

989
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,960
built a particular uh targeted

990
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,880
nanoparticle uh for our our our goal. So

991
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,000
we have some chemistry. I think that

992
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,000
this is kind of the table stakes in L&P

993
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,839
biology is trying to understand kind of

994
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,320
what kinds of ionizable and other

995
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,440
components you can put together. We've

996
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,920
developed this high throughput

997
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,079
formulation platform internally a

998
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,079
proprietary system to be able to get you

999
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,960
know 96 nanoparticles of different

1000
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,200
formulations simultaneously. We've also

1001
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,200
developed a proprietary barcoding system

1002
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,440
as I'll describe. It allows you to

1003
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,960
distinguish from being just getting to

1004
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,359
the organ of interest but actually

1005
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,760
getting into the cell type of interest

1006
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,640
and escaping the endoome and delivering

1007
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,119
that therapeutic uh capability. And then

1008
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,200
we, you know, machine learning for us is

1009
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,200
a tool and we try to sprinkle it in

1010
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,079
wherever we can and to give us the

1011
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,480
advantage of being able to take large

1012
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,000
scale data sets and turn them into new

1013
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,720
learnings.

1014
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,160
Another piece of uh the flagship

1015
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,640
ecosystem that I just wanted to

1016
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,720
highlight here is mRNA is just one

1017
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,320
language that the cell speaks in. There

1018
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,680
are a variety of different languages of

1019
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,760
nucleic acids that uh the cell uses and

1020
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,240
we've been able to work with a large

1021
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,119
number of different kinds of nucleic

1022
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,720
acids um mRNA transfer RNAs um small

1023
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,720
interfering RNAs that you've just heard

1024
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,880
that you've heard about as well as DNA

1025
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,440
and gene editing and sample amplifying

1026
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,400
RNAs that are quite large and still

1027
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,359
remain to be are still are challenging

1028
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,599
to uh um formulate but we've been able

1029
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,599
to expose our lipid nanoparticles to

1030
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,760
those as well to be able to understand

1031
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,359
what else what other languages can we

1032
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,560
deliver and what other therapeutic

1033
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:21,440
hypotheses can we deliver to the cell.

1034
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,079
So our pipeline looks quite broad but

1035
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,800
really what we're trying to do is unlock

1036
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,200
tissues so that we can enable these

1037
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,599
therapeutic hypotheses to be developed.

1038
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,839
So I'll talk a little bit about how we

1039
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,560
have built out our first set of uh um

1040
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,480
components. We usually start by

1041
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,560
identifying a cell type of interest. The

1042
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,280
base L&P is really where most of the

1043
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,119
work needs to be done. Being able to

1044
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,359
ensure that the particle gets to the

1045
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,119
cells and tissues of interest and then

1046
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,560
doesn't get into the cells where you

1047
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,960
want to avoid offtarget toxicity.

1048
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,359
Then additional as I'll show you there's

1049
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,599
some benefit to adding um some

1050
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,520
intelligence to the particle as it were

1051
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,040
by adding in binders that then

1052
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,480
selectively get to cell types of

1053
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,079
interest. um and and revealing that. So

1054
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,920
I'll just describe our barcoding

1055
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,040
technology first. So we have a large

1056
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,119
library of of uh proprietary lipids and

1057
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,760
what we do is we formulate in this case

1058
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,760
um example is 10 lipids. So this is real

1059
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,079
data. So it's not even though it looks

1060
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,440
all very colorful. It's actual data. Um

1061
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,480
we took 10 ionizable lipids. Uh they are

1062
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,119
now encoded by 10 different nucleic acid

1063
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,720
barcodes. And what you see on the on the

1064
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,760
far right uh your left is the dose. So

1065
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,839
we're trying to dose in equal numbers of

1066
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,599
these barcodes and different L&P uh

1067
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,599
different lipid nano particles. What you

1068
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,040
see in the middle is now we're very

1069
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,560
interested in getting to immune cells

1070
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,720
for this particular example. So we're

1071
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,880
pulling out the spleen and then asking

1072
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,040
how much how many of those barcoded

1073
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,040
dosed barcodes actually ended up in the

1074
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,960
spleen. So that allows you to look at

1075
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,359
now the proportion in the stacked column

1076
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,839
plot of all the different uh barcodes

1077
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,920
that ended up there.

1078
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,040
This is a technology that has been used

1079
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,920
pretty widely. But one thing that um

1080
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,560
kind of causes some constrnation at

1081
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,560
least in uh in our in our experience is

1082
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,359
that only about 1 to 2% of those L&PS

1083
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,520
actually deliver their therapeutic uh

1084
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,160
cargo into the cytoplasm. So many of

1085
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,319
these barcodes are stuck inside the

1086
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,480
cell. What we do in the last part is

1087
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,119
that the nucleic acid that then gets

1088
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,720
delivered into the cytoplasm under goes

1089
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,200
a modification that changes its

1090
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,920
sequence. So we now can distinguish

1091
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,400
between the cytoplasmically delivered

1092
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,480
material and the material that was dosed

1093
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,720
into the animal. And that allows us to

1094
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,440
look at different kinds of uh

1095
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,040
phenotypes. So enrichment here we're

1096
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,280
we're seeing that the um an LNP gets

1097
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,560
well into the spleen and also seems to

1098
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,119
get well into the splenic cell

1099
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,440
cytoplasm. That's what the third column

1100
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,040
would be. There's also some examples

1101
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,119
where the reduction in the

1102
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,560
biodistribution is actually turns out to

1103
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:11,119
be very small in the in the dish in the

1104
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,760
splen spleen itself but very large in

1105
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,240
the cytoplasm. These are particles that

1106
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,880
now we've um done a a good deal of

1107
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,800
analysis on actually have increased

1108
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,960
endooal escape. If you put them in the

1109
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,560
endoome, they deliver their material

1110
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,160
very well. So much so that they don't

1111
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,640
even hang around in the endoome for a

1112
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,400
long time and as a result have very good

1113
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,599
delivery into the cell types of

1114
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,200
interest. And then of course there are

1115
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,960
nanoparticles that we can say we can

1116
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,800
exclude. They don't they don't really go

1117
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,800
to the spleen very well and they don't

1118
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,200
really accumulate in the spleen. So this

1119
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,760
allows us then to identify a set of

1120
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,880
lipid nanoparticles that can go to in

1121
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,000
this case um the spleen which is the

1122
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,160
second column here. One critical piece

1123
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,119
of the lipid nanoparticle field is how

1124
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,880
do we dearget the liver? So those of you

1125
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,160
that took your physiology you can't

1126
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,480
dearget the liver. It takes 25% of of

1127
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,079
the volume of the blood. So you can't

1128
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,240
get particles not to go there but you

1129
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,839
can get them not to go into hpatocytes.

1130
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,920
And that's part of what we've developed

1131
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:12,319
here is a number of lipid nanoparticles

1132
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,560
that don't undergo delivery into the

1133
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,800
liver so that then they can persist and

1134
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,640
go to other sites in the in the body.

1135
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,839
And what we've seen here is two

1136
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,560
different nanoparticles here that have

1137
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,720
modest levels of reduction in liver

1138
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,200
delivery and some increased levels of

1139
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,680
the spleen. And this is our base for our

1140
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,359
ability to then do

1141
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,440
um active learning based uh formulation

1142
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,760
optimization. So what we do is we take

1143
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,359
our formulation and luckily Gio

1144
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,079
described what the four components are

1145
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,599
that go into traditional nanoparticles.

1146
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,400
They're put together in a particular

1147
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,520
level of formulation components. We then

1148
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,599
put those into animals at large numbers

1149
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,680
and then identify all of that data to

1150
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,079
try to understand how we can hill climb

1151
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,400
and increase the level of ontarget

1152
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,119
delivery in the spleen and reduce the

1153
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,880
level of delivery in the liver. And what

1154
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,920
you can see here is over the course of a

1155
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,680
variety large number of invivo studies

1156
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,880
we can on the left on the right hand

1157
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,040
side sorry your left hand side

1158
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,680
uh you can see that we're minimizing

1159
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,839
liver delivery in this case almost two

1160
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,079
orders of magnitude in the context of a

1161
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,839
bioluminescent cargo and on the right

1162
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,480
hand side we're being able to maintain

1163
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,280
delivery to the extraatic site and so we

1164
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,839
started with our barcoding allowed us to

1165
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,440
identify a base LNP that was the

1166
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,000
substrate for machine learning then

1167
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,800
allowed us to then look at delivery. And

1168
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,280
so what you can see on the um bar graph

1169
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,160
here is delivery now to human cells in a

1170
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,839
mouse where we've uh put in human uh tea

1171
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,400
cells. And what you're looking at is

1172
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,319
you're looking you see that um our

1173
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,400
commercial lipid gets to about 30% of

1174
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,040
those tea cells and we can increase the

1175
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,319
level of delivery to about 60% in this

1176
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,480
model. But perhaps more importantly,

1177
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,640
the immunoistochemistry, which is a more

1178
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,520
qualitative readout, shows you that the

1179
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,520
commercial lipid gets avidly to the uh

1180
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,160
liver. And this is me measured by the

1181
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,319
brown staining, which is a uh readout

1182
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,000
for the reporter that we've delivered to

1183
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,720
these cells. And you can see that our

1184
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,599
MRI lipids have remarkably lower levels

1185
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,079
of delivery. So we've now created a

1186
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,119
particle that when injected IV will go

1187
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,880
to TE-C cells and not to the liver. That

1188
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,640
wasn't good enough. We wanted to see if

1189
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,240
we could do even better. So, we

1190
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,680
identified a number of receptors on T-

1191
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,119
cells. You're familiar, those of you

1192
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,800
that are familiar with the alphabet soup

1193
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,640
of T- cells will know CD3, CD8, CD4. But

1194
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,240
more importantly, we have a number of

1195
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,240
companies again within the flagship

1196
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,400
ecosystem that we love to take advantage

1197
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,119
of that are building many kinds of

1198
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,200
binders. Traditional vaccination or

1199
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,960
immunization based approaches, but also

1200
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,119
ones that are based on viral proteins

1201
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,960
that have been evolved over millions of

1202
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,119
years and that have low immunogenicity

1203
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,280
and high affinity on the order of

1204
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,760
picomolder binding some of these viral

1205
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,800
proteins. And then also uh you may be

1206
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,359
familiar with Lio Laya Sciences recently

1207
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,960
uh had a fairly significant A- round.

1208
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,920
They are building machine learning

1209
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,079
binders for us and they happen in a

1210
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,319
month and you don't have to wait for any

1211
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,400
mice to kind of develop antibodies for

1212
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,520
for any of this for any of this work. So

1213
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,599
we're very excited about the

1214
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,000
opportunities to build these binders.

1215
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,000
One of these binders against CD8 was

1216
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,079
then added to the surface of our lipid

1217
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,240
nanoparticle. And I'll just quickly walk

1218
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,839
through the fact that what we can what

1219
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,079
we've been able to do is take the base

1220
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,800
L&P and now increase the level of

1221
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,680
delivery dramatically inside these uh

1222
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,560
mouse models and maintain the level of

1223
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:46,400
offtarget uh delivery compared to our

1224
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:49,280
commercial LMP and and this um this is

1225
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,680
our base substrate for now doing some

1226
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,520
clinical studies with some partners.

1227
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,720
Those of you that are familiar with the

1228
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:59,359
CARTT field will know that in vivo

1229
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,200
reprogramming of te- cells to be able to

1230
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,800
not have to take the tea cells out for

1231
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,119
each patient and then put them back in

1232
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,000
again but actually directly reprogram is

1233
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:12,160
actually a particular uh case study here

1234
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,640
and we hope to have some uh NHP data on

1235
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,119
that very soon.

1236
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,800
We've taken the same uh approach and now

1237
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,359
we've been able to go after other immune

1238
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,559
cells and hematopoetic cells stem cells

1239
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,839
as well to be able to direct a lipid

1240
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:31,119
nanoparticle with a base to a cell type

1241
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:34,960
of interest using uh one of these uh

1242
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,640
base LMPS as well as an a binder. So

1243
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,319
we've developed a number of technologies

1244
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,559
happy to discuss those with others. They

1245
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:43,680
may be that may be of interest to you.

1246
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,079
multiplex barcoding in vivo the machine

1247
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,400
learning the active learning the immune

1248
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,760
cell tropism as well as our modular

1249
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,240
extrahypatic platform using a binder um

1250
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,640
again our model is really co-creation

1251
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,839
with a partner so we're currently look

1252
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,119
we currently have a number of

1253
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,119
partnerships where we're looking at a

1254
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,160
variety of different therapeutic cargos

1255
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,680
using these targeted L&PS and we're

1256
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,599
we've opened up a number of these cell

1257
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,440
types some of them may be of interest to

1258
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,319
people in the audience happy to discuss

1259
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,319
so thank you very much.

1260
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,599
>> Can you hear me?

1261
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,680
Um, that was great. Uh, and we're going

1262
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,119
to have questions from the audience, but

1263
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,720
before we do that, um, today has been an

1264
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,680
interesting morning. We started the day

1265
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,240
off with a government shutdown and this

1266
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:48,240
is sort of illustrative of um the sort

1267
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,079
of impacts that we're seeing across R&D.

1268
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,319
I often like to tell people that the

1269
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,880
model in this country for R&D is going

1270
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,280
to change and evolve in many ways that

1271
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,520
affects all the sectors. And given that

1272
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,920
we have two academics and one former

1273
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,880
academic who's made the jump into

1274
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,599
industry, I'm curious to um hear your

1275
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:11,920
perspectives about how this will impact

1276
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:14,480
you in your respective sectors.

1277
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,599
>> You want me to start? Um well, of

1278
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,319
course, it's it's not good from um many

1279
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,480
different um levels. I think it, you

1280
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,839
know, it's really hard for us while we

1281
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,920
are very good at controlling

1282
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,520
experiments, it's really hard for us to

1283
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,440
control the government and what's

1284
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,040
happening around us. So, I think there's

1285
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,400
really not much that um we can do

1286
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,720
outside of just trying to manage um our

1287
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,640
lab and our spending and sort of how we

1288
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,640
think about

1289
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,800
you know uh making sure that we continue

1290
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,960
to innovate and continue to push the

1291
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,400
work forward. I think actually at the

1292
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,640
beginning in your talk really

1293
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,040
illustrated that MIT given all the

1294
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,079
uncertainty around funding not just due

1295
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,160
to the shutdown but MIT has really uh

1296
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,880
put forward a lot of different programs

1297
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,280
to kind of help supplement maybe some of

1298
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,960
the losses that we'll see um you know

1299
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,880
and that we are seeing from from the

1300
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,839
government funding you know the other

1301
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,839
aspects are um looking at other ways to

1302
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,400
receive funding and that's foundations

1303
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:16,800
and myself and I know Gio we've been you

1304
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,400
know fortunate to work with um the Gates

1305
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,240
Foundation

1306
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,480
um and and other foundations that I

1307
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,520
think are not affected necessarily

1308
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,079
though obviously they're being asked for

1309
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,800
to fund more work so that's affecting

1310
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:34,319
how much they can give right to some

1311
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:37,359
extent um and then you know really being

1312
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:40,960
creative and maybe um Jack can talk more

1313
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:43,200
about that how uh we can partner um with

1314
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,040
industry perhaps some sort of inind

1315
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,440
things where there's an exchange change

1316
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,760
of scientists or access to different

1317
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,359
facilities. So really trying to make

1318
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,760
things happen even though you don't have

1319
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,880
that grant coming in, but maybe you can

1320
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,839
have a a free person if you will and

1321
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,280
free access to equipment or or something

1322
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,720
um that can really help move the

1323
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,920
research forward even though you don't

1324
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
have the big grants coming in.

1325
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,680
>> I mean Gio, you've talked a lot about um

1326
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:11,520
ARPA. So do you expect any sort of

1327
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,599
impacts on your group?

1328
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,480
So with respect to RPH, I mean I

1329
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,079
received our RPH grants. It's I don't

1330
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,680
know if people are familiar with RPH,

1331
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,800
but RPH sort of is a new entity

1332
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,480
relatively new. That's sort of about

1333
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:27,359
three years ago to basically support

1334
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,760
high-risk uh potentially high reward

1335
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,440
concepts and to try and nurture them,

1336
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,319
you know, all the way through ideally

1337
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,480
through early stage clinical trials. and

1338
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:39,280
RH is one of the largest ones in the

1339
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,200
country uh over $60 million aiming to

1340
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,160
transform what we can deliver orally and

1341
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,079
so far as can we deliver nucleic acids

1342
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,839
and achieve high availability or can we

1343
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,119
deliver electrocuts which wasn't

1344
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,680
something I talked about today but a lot

1345
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,319
of the work that we're doing now and so

1346
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,240
I received a notice yesterday that our

1347
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,319
funding happens to be managed by the

1348
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,000
department of the interior that's just a

1349
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,920
nuance of how the different funding

1350
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,839
comes through but I received a notice

1351
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,200
that we should continue so Our guidance

1352
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:10,559
was continue and that that was the

1353
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,400
guidance. I think just to add to what

1354
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,800
Anna was just saying and I think whether

1355
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,480
there is a shutdown or not, I think if

1356
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,359
anything it just highlights what I think

1357
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,240
increasingly we as an academic community

1358
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,920
recognize is that we need to diversify

1359
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,359
if we haven't done so already as far as

1360
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,200
our funding streams, right? And so as

1361
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,559
Anna said, we've been fortunate to work

1362
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,880
with the Gates Foundation for over a

1363
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,480
decade. And um you know, we I've worked

1364
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,040
very closely with Nova Nordis for over a

1365
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,880
decade as well. Um and a few others and

1366
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,079
I think if anything whenever there are

1367
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,640
shutdowns, it's not the first one at

1368
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,240
least unfortunately uh in the last few

1369
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,760
years. And I think it just again sort of

1370
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,319
reemphasizes the need uh as an academic

1371
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:51,200
to you know try and at least seek out

1372
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,640
opportunities and partnerships. And I

1373
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,079
mean that's my my tip.

1374
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,680
>> And then how's this impacting industry?

1375
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,200
And it's just like maybe it's the silver

1376
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,240
lining that we may all play better

1377
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,040
together.

1378
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:04,160
>> Uh uh I think we play well pretty well

1379
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,800
already. I think uh I I don't want to I

1380
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,480
said it's been said many times but not

1381
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,480
only does do the ideas the nent ideas

1382
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,000
that are leveraged in the context of

1383
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,920
industry whether by individual

1384
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
entrepreneurship or you know by

1385
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,400
licensing some of these ideas you guys

1386
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,720
are generating the workforce. I love

1387
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,880
hiring MIT students. Uh, you know,

1388
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,520
they're fantastic. They are well

1389
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,599
trained. So, I think that we just that

1390
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,920
the it feels like there's no more

1391
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,480
toothpaste in the tube at some point,

1392
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,079
right? If we do not fill this uh

1393
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,319
pipeline, we're not going to have those

1394
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,720
kinds of people. But to your point, in

1395
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,480
the near term, let's say that we can get

1396
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,800
over this at some point, I do think that

1397
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,200
there are some real opportunities for

1398
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,520
really interfacing some of these things.

1399
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,520
There's I'll be honest there's no chance

1400
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,079
I'm going to be getting any raora fish

1401
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,079
at Marai setting up some kind of lab

1402
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,760
there to look at those. So there are

1403
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:02,319
some really fantastic ideas that when

1404
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,559
academics are ready we really would love

1405
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,720
to partner. And what do we offer? We

1406
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,200
offer some of the opportunities to take

1407
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,440
things to scale perhaps that maybe are

1408
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,720
not always available. The ability to be

1409
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,280
able to scale out in some large sets of

1410
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,680
experiments. So we do have capital

1411
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,119
>> somewhat that I think could be deployed.

1412
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,359
So everybody will have to give a little

1413
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,119
bit on either side. It's not the same

1414
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:28,880
kind of uh trench warfare that we we

1415
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,280
might have uh experienced before, but

1416
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,960
I'm very excited about what we can do.

1417
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,040
>> And and you mentioned an interesting

1418
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,119
model system. So we also know that the

1419
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,680
federal government is changing how we

1420
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:42,079
think about the use of animals within

1421
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,680
research and trying to get us to think

1422
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,839
about sort of alternatives to

1423
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,400
traditional animal model animal models.

1424
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,640
So um how are you all thinking about

1425
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,640
that push?

1426
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,520
Well, I think it'd be great if we didn't

1427
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,799
have um didn't have to do all the animal

1428
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,680
work and there was a very uh validated

1429
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:08,559
way to evaluate things in a nonan animal

1430
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,319
model. Um I think and and so if that um

1431
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,559
you you know people some people are

1432
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,799
working on this and lab on a chip and

1433
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,440
and various um things we're doing some

1434
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:20,319
stuff with uh women's health health in

1435
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,880
that space trying to see how um you know

1436
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:25,040
drugs and lactating mothers get into uh

1437
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,359
the breast milk and um can we screen

1438
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,920
which drugs do that um without you know

1439
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,680
in in a dish rather than going to actual

1440
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,839
experiments

1441
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,520
in animals or or people and I think as

1442
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,079
long is it's safe. It's actually a good

1443
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,000
push, but there needs to be resources

1444
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,839
and funding to really develop and

1445
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,400
validate. That's really the key piece

1446
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:46,319
here is validate that um we have a good

1447
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,160
alternative that is predictive.

1448
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,880
>> Um and I think once we have that, it

1449
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,280
could be actually uh a you know,

1450
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,599
helpful. But of course, we don't want to

1451
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,760
um I certainly wouldn't want my child or

1452
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:01,200
myself to receive something that hasn't

1453
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,079
been tested in you, you know, an animal

1454
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,640
just on a chip and but you know um

1455
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,400
anyway you know in a few decades maybe

1456
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,720
we'll have such strong validation that

1457
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,799
we'll have confidence that that is safe

1458
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,200
and you what what can we do at MIT along

1459
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,200
these lines?

1460
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,640
>> Yeah. No, I mean I think that it's

1461
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,160
wonderful to see that sort of these

1462
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,799
things are aligning and we've been

1463
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,960
working on Xvivo and in vitro models of

1464
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,319
the GI tract for example and deliver you

1465
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,000
know for about a decade. I mean we

1466
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,760
started a company that is based here and

1467
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,160
in Switzerland that you know is doing

1468
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,240
this for drug delivery science and also

1469
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,799
we have some more recent data really

1470
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,720
predicting toxicity in a dish that

1471
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:39,200
translates really well to large animal

1472
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,040
models. So I agree I think that it's

1473
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,920
wise. I agree with Anna though. I think

1474
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,440
that it's still early, right? So the

1475
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,079
vision and dream of having these

1476
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,599
encilico twins that are able to predict

1477
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,040
the outcome of the experiment without

1478
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:55,280
having done the experiment in vivo is

1479
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,960
challenging with the current data set.

1480
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,040
Can we get there? You know perhaps and

1481
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,200
and I hope that that we do. You know I

1482
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,040
think that would be incredible. I you

1483
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,760
know I I just I don't think people want

1484
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,720
to use animals and and I think that we

1485
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,880
really try to do everything we can

1486
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,440
before we get to that point but I think

1487
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,680
it's more the burden of data to overcome

1488
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,760
that hurdle to convince you know the

1489
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,720
regulators and ourselves as the end

1490
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,280
users or or loved ones etc to to use it

1491
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,599
that

1492
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,720
>> and is industry looking at MIT to sort

1493
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,119
of help fill the critical path in some

1494
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,960
way?

1495
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,760
>> Absolutely. Hey, I I think that the you

1496
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,599
know I'm not going to add to what an NGO

1497
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,480
said. I think it's fantastic. I think

1498
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,960
the regulators are also thinking about

1499
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,160
the modularity of these things. So the

1500
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,920
idea that

1501
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,319
>> maybe for a single drug you'll have to

1502
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,119
do certain kinds of animal studies, but

1503
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:49,280
then if you just replace the mRNA, would

1504
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,200
you have to do all of that work again?

1505
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,359
And so this idea that we can then

1506
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,440
version you know for the computer

1507
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,079
scientists in the audience version

1508
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,040
control these drugs and then take

1509
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,200
advantage to reduce the burden of animal

1510
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,280
models in the aggregate I think is

1511
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,400
another area that uh where we we can

1512
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:11,040
exploit and you know again uh MIT is not

1513
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,000
just the tech part or the

1514
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,000
entrepreneurship it's it has strong

1515
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,319
binds into the regulatory agencies as

1516
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,480
well because they all do work through

1517
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:22,319
kind of the logic and education that we

1518
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,359
all use. So, how can we make that

1519
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,280
happen?

1520
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,119
>> We we have more questions on the list,

1521
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,359
but we have run out of time. So, I'm

1522
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,520
sure our speakers would be happy to uh

1523
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:33,520
address any questions that you have at

1524
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,799
the break, but please join me in

1525
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,799
thanking them again for a great panel.
