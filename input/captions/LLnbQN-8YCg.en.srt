1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,240
so I am Tom uh I'm a postto here at MIT

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,800
uh and today I'm going to be talking to

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,559
you about scaling AI enabled protein

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,040
engineering um and for this I think it's

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,199
important to uh focus on the context

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,680
I've been working in and particularly

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,119
the application spaces so if you join me

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,119
uh here in the middle of this design

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,279
build test learn cycle um I've been

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,760
working lots on neglected tropical

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,720
disease and particularly developing

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,119
recombinant snake antivenom um and also

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,640
in bioindustry and sustainability so

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,840
discovering binding proteins that would

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,800
modulate the activity of industrially or

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,280
agriculturally relevant enzymes now

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,960
these seem like two fairly disparate

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,719
Fields but I do believe they are united

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,719
by a commonality which is that lots and

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,160
lots of our um extremely powerful modern

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
biotechnological tools could be applied

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,199
to solve a vast range of problems in

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,280
these spaces but we are limited by the

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,199
costs associated with implementing those

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,680
tools um so my thesis is essentially

26
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,159
that by reducing costs we can increase

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,840
the number of people that are working on

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,000
relevant problems and thus increase the

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,439
number of solutions that are found um to

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,240
reduce costs I believe we can uh kind of

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,880
combine lots of advances we've had in

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,360
these uh three themes and particularly

33
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,400
um relevant to today is in the design

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,000
space so using phenotype enriched

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,880
Library design and this can either be uh

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,400
kind of Taken um notice of Nature's

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,240
ability to design things so looking at

38
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,000
metagenomic databases using AI guided

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,439
directed Evolution or um one of my

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
favorite things now is just entirely

41
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,320
denovo protein Generation Um and by

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,759
combining these things uh I think it

43
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,640
becomes possible to say that we can

44
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,920
achieve things like this where we can

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,439
get one to 10 binding proteins against a

46
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,600
specified epitope on a Target protein

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,079
with inv vitro validation and in silic

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,159
structural um prediction for less than

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,799
$100 and hopefully you agree with me

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,399
that that is a very impactful price

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,640
point if we want to actually go out and

52
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:03,439
develop um Solutions in some of these

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,079
spaces so to talk you through why I

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,759
believe that this is a reasonable

55
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,200
statement to make it can start with um

56
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,640
our work in the design space which was a

57
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,440
through a collaboration with the baker

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,560
lab using RF diffusion to denovo design

59
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,800
um mini binders against snake

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,000
three-finger neurotoxins um with this we

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,800
achieved a 2% hit rate uh with pamola to

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,040
nanomolar affinities and most

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,280
importantly achieved functional invivo

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,239
neutralization of these toxins and this

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,200
was massively aided um by the ability to

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,120
pre-specify the epitope on the Target

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,319
that we wanted to bind to so we could

68
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,640
block the known toxin receptor

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,319
interaction in Vivo if you want to learn

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,200
more about that you can follow this QR

71
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,760
code in the bottom left to the preprint

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,120
um so what so after that work um what

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,920
quickly became uh abundantly clear to me

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,599
was that design was no longer a

75
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,599
particularly rate limiting step in our

76
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,080
ability to implement Solutions uh and

77
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,879
instead that fall Fells more on our

78
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,440
ability to build build designs and

79
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,159
actually test them in the lab and this

80
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,519
is something touched upon already the

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,879
ability to generate data or

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,040
experimentally validate um our insoo

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,720
predictions so for this just as an

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,319
example um I've shown here how much it

85
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,760
costs to actually assemble uh different

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,040
numbers of 400 base pair mini binder

87
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,920
genes depending on the vendor and this

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,239
is going from ordering the DNA to having

89
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,040
an entirely sequence validated clone um

90
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,920
this I think is best uh showcased with

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,599
this example scaling it up to test for

92
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,000
instance 3,000 uh designs if you ordered

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,439
this as E blocks from IDT it costs over

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,879
$80,000 from twist as Multiplex Gene

95
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,319
fragments it's about

96
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,239
$25,000 but you can use alternative

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,000
sources of DNA so for instance oligo

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,799
pools where you can get the cost down to

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,720
about $3 to $4,000 for this or about $1

100
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,560
per design um now to actually achieve

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,959
this you need to assemble the oligo

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,400
pools into full length genes yourself

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,120
which um I've built a pipeline to do in

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,799
the and this I can chat about more at my

105
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,560
posto if you want to come and talk about

106
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,200
it but just to briefly show that we''re

107
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,400
already just on our first pass of this

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,040
achieving 76% of assemblies being

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,000
entirely error error free without any uh

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,040
required error correction

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,720
processes um obviously all of our

112
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,680
building means nothing if we can't also

113
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,120
test uh so for this we've been

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,360
establishing um the use of split

115
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,639
luciferase uh in particularly in a kind

116
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,080
of automated setup where it costs about

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
six cents um per assay to test each

118
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,880
design and with this we can get the

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
expression level of a protein of

120
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,240
interest and also the bind in affinity

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,759
and specificity um and what's very nice

122
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,240
about this is that it's an entirely no

123
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,199
wash homogeneous assay it works in cell

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,520
liate um so it's very simple to

125
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,680
implement we're now using that to test

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,880
more um designs against uh snake three

127
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,840
finger neurotoxins and in particularly

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,479
using the scalability of this pipeline

129
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,080
to look for cross reactivity which we

130
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,800
believe is going to be a fundamental

131
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,840
phenotype for achieving an actually

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,120
cheap and effective uh snake antivenom

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,600
product so hopefully today I've uh

134
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,280
interested you in maybe some new

135
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,320
application spaces of lots of the tools

136
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,000
that we're developing uh and also convey

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,520
to you the importance of building more

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,520
efficient build and test Cycles thank

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
you
