1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,120
good

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,120
afternoon

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,359
so the last time we have done uh um the

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:25,720
definition of a simple system

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,560
model is very important because we

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,599
acquire um the so-called

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,559
microscopic limit

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,480
which Al when we deal with many

9
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,200
particles in in a

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,440
container and which is the framework in

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:50,879
which most of thermodynamics uh has been

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:50,879
developed uh until uh maybe 20 years ago

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,079
or and so we will uh review

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,280
um just uh quickly what we've done uh

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:08,880
remember that the issue here is

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,520
that walls cause raction

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,680
effects because the density of the

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,400
particles must go to zero at the

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,040
wall in most Frameworks we have seen

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,799
some

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,560
examples and so these raction effects

22
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,759
are important like here because when I

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:38,280
remove a partition

24
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:42,399
they leave a sort of a hole or L faction

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,680
area that will spontaneously be filled

26
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,159
by the

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,439
particles as they realize that they wall

28
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,680
is not there anymore and so if you

29
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,680
remove the wall you get a spontaneous

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,479
and therefore the reversible process

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,399
that takes you as represented on the

32
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,240
evil sucess diagram from this state to

33
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,959
that

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,800
state and this is an irreversible uh

35
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,160
spontaneous

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,000
process later on today we will talk

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:21,879
about uh just in a few minutes about

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
going also up this way but for the

39
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:30,360
moment let me just uh uh recall

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,480
that in the limit of many particles

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,080
the stable equilibrium State curve for

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,720
the composite

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,159
system divided into uh two

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,200
partitions be gets closer and

45
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,400
closer uh to the stable equilibrium

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,040
State curve for the system the same

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,280
particles uh but no

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:03:00,080
partitions and therefore that

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:03,519
effect uh also the raction effect is uh

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,319
smaller and it becomes negligible as we

51
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,560
have several particles

52
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,319
fact yes we have seen some examples uh

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,200
in that paper that I pointed to you

54
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,200
where there are 10 to the 5ifth

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
particles

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,680
but that is

57
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,560
extremely cold temperatures I believe uh

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,560
whereas at normal

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,519
temperatures uh as soon as you have uh

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,680
maybe 10 20 particles uh these veraction

61
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,599
effects become

62
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,760
already

63
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,519
pretty neg

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,519
negligible and that's why we we can use

65
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,239
the

66
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:56,040
um the many particle the simple system

67
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,920
model uh for most the systems not only

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,599
macroscopic but also mesoscopic and even

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,000
microscopic as long as you don't go to

70
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,000
Just few

71
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:16,880
molecules and the idea is that in that

72
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,120
limit we can neglect the uh essentially

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:25,400
the effect of in inserting or removing

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,400
partitions from a stable equum

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,000
stake nothing ically that

76
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,080
is equivalent to assuming that the

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
fundamental

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,919
relation is a function a homogeneous

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,280
function of first degree in all of its

80
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:50,160
variables meaning

81
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,680
this and as we said from that

82
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
mathematical

83
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,520
uh condition which represents the

84
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:01,840
physics that we we said um we gain one

85
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,240
relation which is the Oiler relation

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,000
which I was unable to prove with the

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,560
previous uh view graph so here's a new

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,560
view graph which does a better

89
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:21,400
job this is the

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,880
condition and in order

91
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,720
to uh to prove

92
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,080
it yeah here's the proof you just have

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,840
to take the partial derivative of both

94
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,960
sides with respect to

95
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Lambda and so on the left hand side

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,039
there is no Lambda so partial derivative

97
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,639
is zero and on the right hand side it's

98
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,160
Lambda time U so it's

99
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,680
U uh plus Lambda time the derivative of

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,840
you with respect to the first uh

101
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,319
variable which is the

102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,720
temperature evaluated at the same

103
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,120
independent

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,759
variables times the derivative of this

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,440
um argument here that is s over Lambda

106
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,240
which does depend on Lambda so the

107
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,400
derivative is s over minus Lambda squ

108
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,120
and so on for the other derivatives and

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,800
here is what you get and now in this

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,120
expression here if you set Lambda equal

111
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,120
to

112
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,599
one outomes the oiler

113
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,120
relation you can also take from this the

114
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,400
fact that

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:36,039
the the the derivatives the partial

116
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,919
derivatives of fundamental relation are

117
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,880
homogeneous functions of degree zero in

118
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,280
other

119
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,479
words uh see there is no Lambda

120
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,440
multiplying in front so the temperature

121
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,120
of a system we've given sdnn is equal to

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,000
the temperature of course we're talking

123
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,000
about stable equilibrium States uh for a

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,240
system in which the sbnm are divided by

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,639
the same number

126
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,680
number as long as it's the same number

127
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
it will be the same

128
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,160
temperature so that means small or large

129
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,680
as long as the relative amounts are

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,800
equal you get the same temperature for

131
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,479
the stable equum

132
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,080
stage

133
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:26,199
okay so that's the oiler

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,759
relation and we have proved

135
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,440
that thanks to the oil relation we can

136
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,160
define specific spe

137
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:37,680
properties which for example is the the

138
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,520
specific energy is the energy divided by

139
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,840
uh n and

140
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,479
um and then we can see how this specific

141
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,120
property is a function of the other

142
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,639
specific property so and specific

143
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,879
entropy specific volume and the mole

144
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,800
fractions which are the specific amounts

145
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,840
of constituents

146
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,280
and and as we see here there is a lot of

147
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,560
inde dependence but we prove that the

148
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,039
partial derivative of U with respect to

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,280
n is equal to -1 / n

150
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,919
2times this quantity and this quantity

151
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,639
you remember is what we called the uh

152
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,960
Oiler free energy it's the

153
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
characteristic function in

154
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:35,320
fact and uh the

155
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:39,479
is still valid also for small

156
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,919
systems here is what we how we Define

157
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,800
the oiler free

158
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,959
energy and here it's a

159
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,959
differential from which for example we

160
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,120
can see

161
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,000
that the amount of one constituent is

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,880
equal to the partial of the oil free

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,040
energy with respect to the chemical

164
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,120
potential of that constituent

165
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,399
when you hold fixed the temperature the

166
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,560
pressure and the chemical potentials of

167
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,160
all the other constituents so if you

168
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,200
have a reservoir that keeps temperature

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,320
pressure and also chemical

170
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,720
potentials except this one and uh you

171
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,640
can by changing the chemical potential

172
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,720
and know knowing uh measuring the

173
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,600
amounts you you can measure the oiler uh

174
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,360
free

175
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,360
energy this might be

176
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:39,360
a possible procedure to measure these or

177
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,360
small systems using molecular

178
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,440
Dynamics well here um what we have

179
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:49,440
done in the previous slide in order to

180
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,480
compute the derivative of energy we

181
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,000
respect the

182
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,120
amount the derivative of specific energy

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,440
we respect to the amounts at fixed

184
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,920
specific uh entropy volume and mole fr

185
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,800
actions to find that it is minus 1 / n *

186
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,200
the

187
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,720
oiler the oiler free

188
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,079
energy uh we have done it also for these

189
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,480
other properties and they those

190
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:22,160
derivatives turn all to be all equal at

191
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,720
least for the for those that

192
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,320
uh for the specific properties that

193
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,640
emerge from the um from

194
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,399
the theander transform form of the

195
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,279
energy version of the fundamental

196
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:43,600
relation they all come out to

197
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:46,560
be Oiler free energy divided by uh n²

198
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,760
negative whereas for the

199
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,800
entropy it's minus one / T all all the

200
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,399
same

201
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,440
result

202
00:10:53,399 --> 00:11:00,480
so

203
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,639
since in the limit of many uh particles

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,639
there may be also significance here that

205
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:09,720
uh you are left with an N at the

206
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,240
denominator which so for many particles

207
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,320
grows up and whereas this is the

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,160
specific Oiler free energy the per

209
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,160
particle so this may be an indication

210
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
already that this dependence goes down

211
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,480
with

212
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,480
n uh in any

213
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:32,480
case again these uh relations may be uh

214
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,880
ways to uh

215
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,200
measure uh the

216
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,800
oiler uh free energy for small systems

217
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:45,560
of course because in the large system

218
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,600
limit uh uh the oer free energy is goes

219
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,160
to

220
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,680
zero the O relation is equivalent to

221
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,680
setting EU equal

222
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:03,720
zero so now let's go back to this um

223
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,920
issue of partitioning a

224
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:12,519
system a small system so many few

225
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:16,880
particles and uh we want to see uh if

226
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:19,639
there is a cost in uh uh

227
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,680
dividing the system which is in a stable

228
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,360
equilibrium state in this

229
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
one and

230
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,320
producing another stable equilibrium

231
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:36,120
state of a system with Lambda

232
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,600
partitions in which uh all in each of

233
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,079
which there is the same amount the same

234
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,079
uh um it has the same

235
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,839
volume and also the same entropy and the

236
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,639
overall entropy must be the same so if

237
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:57,600
we do this we can go from here to there

238
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,600
in a reversible weight

239
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:04,920
process and and uh if we go from

240
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,920
partitioned to without partition you see

241
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,720
we go down so we extract the adiabatic

242
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,680
availability

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,279
essentially of that state that is

244
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
generated that if we the moment we

245
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,279
remove those partitions the moment we

246
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,560
remove these partitions the this is not

247
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,279
anymore the stable equilibrium State

248
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,880
curve because we've changed the system

249
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:31,800
so St P becomes this one so yes we could

250
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,959
uh let thing uh evolve spontaneously so

251
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,680
the system will evolve spontaneously at

252
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:42,480
constant energy uh generating entropy by

253
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,800
reversibility but we could also be if we

254
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,600
are good enough and fast enough faster

255
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,760
than

256
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:53,199
irreversibility we could attempt to

257
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,000
extract this adiabatic availability and

258
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,199
go all the way down at constant entropy

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,040
to to

260
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,040
reach uh this stable

261
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,839
instead but this also says that if I

262
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,120
want to go from here and introduce the

263
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,279
partitions in a weight process so I

264
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,600
cannot

265
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:21,360
go leftward in a weight process I have

266
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,079
the the the first time I I reach the

267
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,759
stable equilibrium state of the system

268
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,000
curve of the system we partitions is

269
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:34,120
here so this is the um

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,480
the first available uh I mean reachable

271
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,399
uh State partition State others could be

272
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,040
up here and so as you as I go from here

273
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,680
to there I need to spend at least this

274
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,839
much

275
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,680
work or energy from the weight in order

276
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,600
to introduce those partitions and

277
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,320
physically you can think of the idea

278
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,920
that uh since there are raction effects

279
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,440
at the wall as you introduce the

280
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,040
partition the partition moves moves the

281
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,920
particles away because it has to create

282
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,920
that space and that is a

283
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,959
work of

284
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,639
course the mathematics of same idea is

285
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,959
that

286
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,600
you the you can compute the work to

287
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,480
introduce those Lambda partitions which

288
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,440
is the minimum work to go from zero to

289
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,160
from just one to

290
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,199
Lambda

291
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,040
uh it's the maximum you can extract if

292
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:41,079
you grow from Lambda 2 one and it is the

293
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,319
difference between the energy here which

294
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:47,199
is e

295
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:52,000
Lambda which is Lambda times the energy

296
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:54,639
of each of the partition so it's E1 E1

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,800
is the is the system with the

298
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,639
fundamental relation of the system

299
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,639
without partitions

300
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,959
that you

301
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,360
evaluate at the values

302
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,079
of of

303
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,560
the entropies volume and and amounts

304
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:17,800
that are present in in one

305
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,000
partition so e Lambda minus E and this

306
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,839
is

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,639
instead uh

308
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,040
E1 fundamental relation of a system

309
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,959
without partitions

310
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,399
evaluated at the value of the entropy of

311
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,560
of the overall system which is the sum

312
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,880
of all the ENT it's essentially Lambda

313
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:42,360
times the entropy that is in each

314
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,360
partition okay so this is this

315
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:51,199
difference and for example we could

316
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,759
uh see how it changes as we go from

317
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:58,279
Lambda to Lambda + one or which is

318
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:01,600
essentially the same from Lambda to

319
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Lambda minus one so minimum work to add

320
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:09,160
or remove uh one uh

321
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,880
partition and notice that it's not

322
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:15,439
exactly so obvious because when I add

323
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,520
one Lambda it's not just just have to

324
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,039
push in I have to also rearrange the

325
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,959
particles in the other lambdas so that

326
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,959
they all divided in uh in equal

327
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,600
amounts but with that understand

328
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,720
standing if you if you see that this

329
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,160
work so it's essentially the work of

330
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,200
going to Lambda + one minus the work of

331
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,400
going to Lambda partitions divided by

332
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,240
one and this is a fancy way of writing

333
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,880
one but to make this ratio look like the

334
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,080
the partial derivative of w with respect

335
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,160
to Lambda and so we can uh since we have

336
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,880
an expression for w we can take the

337
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,679
partial derivative with respect to

338
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:03,400
Lambda do the math and outcomes so that

339
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,360
that work is the oiler

340
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:12,679
um free

341
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:15,600
energy of the uh each partition in the

342
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,960
Lambda subdivided

343
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,320
system so that's

344
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,679
another uh physical interpretation of

345
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,640
the oil of free

346
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,240
energy okay

347
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,880
good

348
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,840
so now that we have the UL System

349
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,000
model there are a number of

350
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,520
results that

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,760
you

352
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,440
uh have seen in uh previous courses of

353
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,200
thermodynamics so I will do a very brief

354
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:51,880
uh review of

355
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,640
those because it also helps um brushing

356
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,159
up uh a

357
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,400
bit considering

358
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,720
um that the other day you didn't

359
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:07,480
remember the value all gamma for

360
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,720
a all right um so the first idea is that

361
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,120
of an extensive

362
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,480
property and here notice I keep

363
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,080
repeating in these titles the this is

364
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,640
now within the simple system model all

365
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,400
right what do we mean by an extensive

366
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,640
property for example the

367
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,360
energy is an extensive property this is

368
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,799
a a precisely

369
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,200
the definition of of this the

370
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,240
mathematical definition of the simple

371
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,360
system model now the homogeneity of

372
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,280
first degree of first degree of the

373
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,360
function that

374
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:47,320
represents um of that was for the energy

375
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,320
this is for any

376
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,960
other any other function that has that

377
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,520
property we call it extensive and you

378
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,000
can prove that examples in the list of

379
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,880
these extensive properties you find and

380
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,120
of course you find entropy find volume

381
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,000
the amounts the total amount which is

382
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,880
the sum of the amounts of the various

383
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,120
different

384
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,120
constituents the

385
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:18,919
enthalpy the enthalpy is not an additive

386
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,600
property

387
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,480
because if you have two systems that are

388
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,159
different

389
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,679
pressures uh enal is U plus

390
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:35,840
PV uh

391
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:39,280
the the P is different and therefore uh

392
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,720
uh u and v are additive but the P that

393
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,200
is is different doesn't make that linear

394
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,080
combination of u and v

395
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,240
additive

396
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:54,080
but if you have U

397
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:58,799
um a simple system in which you can

398
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,760
assume that um you see uh this independ

399
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,799
dependent

400
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:09,159
properties are all divided by the same

401
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,480
number we have uh said before that um

402
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,039
the partial derivatives of the

403
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,520
fundamental relation including pressure

404
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,240
temperature and

405
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,720
pressure uh do not change if you change

406
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,200
all this particular change of of

407
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,600
variables and that is why you find the

408
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,559
enpy uh here in this list if this

409
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,520
extension

410
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:34,039
also the Gibs free

411
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,720
energy it's missing in this list but it

412
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:38,520
is another

413
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,320
example as well as the specific and the

414
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,960
heat

415
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,240
capacities and the

416
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:50,679
mass okay now if I take any two

417
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,760
extensive properties and take the ratio

418
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,919
I

419
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:59,279
obtain uh specific

420
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,679
properties so for example the first line

421
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,480
here represents the specific

422
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,440
properties uh when I divide so these are

423
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,360
the mol specific processes because I

424
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,600
divide by

425
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,440
n or I could have the mass specific

426
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,440
properties when I divide by

427
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,240
m or I could have the volume specific

428
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,120
properties when I divide by V for

429
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,760
example the mass divided by the volume

430
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,559
is the

431
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,880
density of course they are

432
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:34,320
related between one

433
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,039
another and

434
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,400
sometimes here I try to uh differentiate

435
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:44,880
by using a different symbol like the the

436
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:48,200
the the star here is there just uh just

437
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,000
in case you need uh to make sure you

438
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,640
don't get confused but in most of uh uh

439
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,760
the treatments once you set the

440
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,400
definition it's and the context makes it

441
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,320
clear that you're working with uh

442
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,320
Mass specific properties you just use a

443
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,200
lowercase letter without the star and

444
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,240
you let the context uh Define what

445
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,000
you're

446
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,159
doing for

447
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,120
example the amounts if you divide it if

448
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:24,039
you divide them by n you get the mol

449
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,960
fraction I call I use the letter Y subi

450
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,279
but not everybody uses that

451
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:34,159
letters of

452
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:37,200
if I have the mass so I take the take

453
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,320
the the number of particles multiply by

454
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,840
their molecular

455
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:47,120
weight capital M of part

456
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:51,960
Mi and divide by the total mass that is

457
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,960
becomes the um Mass fraction of that

458
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,840
constit I divide the total the amount of

459
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,880
constituents divided per unit volume

460
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,360
what I get is a concentration of those

461
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,559
constituents which in in the

462
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,760
chemistry uh business sometimes is also

463
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:12,080
denoted this way this is the volume

464
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,080
concentration of particles of type

465
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,159
I so

466
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:23,400
notation varies depending on the various

467
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,400
fields in which you apply

468
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:34,360
thermodynamics uh remember

469
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,399
that we Define extensive property when

470
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,240
the for properties when the there is a

471
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:42,000
relation like this but there is a Lambda

472
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,000
here multiplying if there is no

473
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,880
Lambda like as we have said for the

474
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,399
partial derivatives the fundamental

475
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,120
relations so for TP and the chemical

476
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:55,840
potentials but also

477
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,640
for all of the specific properties that

478
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
we just defined

479
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,480
you can

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,880
prove that uh there is no Lambda there

481
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,240
and this relation holds we call these

482
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,240
properties intensive

483
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,760
properties also here I have to warn you

484
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:21,279
that I may be using a definition which

485
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,919
might differ from uh what you've seen uh

486
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,919
um

487
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:32,159
elsewhere so just uh me and careful when

488
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,399
you see the word intensive property uh

489
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:39,440
check how the author defines uh that

490
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:41,720
intensive this is our

491
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,039
definition there are many properties so

492
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,159
we said uh not just TP and uh and

493
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,799
chemical potentials but also all the

494
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,720
specific properties all right so if you

495
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:55,000
take the list of the values of all these

496
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,279
intensive

497
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,520
properties which is using an infinite

498
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,880
number of of of

499
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,960
properties but most of the times there

500
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,360
is an indep a smaller inde set of

501
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,880
independent properties okay the list of

502
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,120
those of all properties of this kind for

503
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,399
a stable equilibrium state is called the

504
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,480
Intensive

505
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,159
State and you can show that you have if

506
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,720
you have the Intensive

507
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:25,799
State then you and you also have the

508
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,720
value for one extensive

509
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,919
property then you have completely fixed

510
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,399
the

511
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,559
state so you must in order to get the

512
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,000
state uh we're talking about stable

513
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,360
equilibrium States within the simple

514
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,440
system model if you uh want the state

515
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:50,760
you can start from the Intensive State

516
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,760
and add a an extensive property

517
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,640
the other idea that is very

518
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,279
U important is a very important

519
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,840
consequence of the simple system model

520
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,559
is that the fact that you can add and

521
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,640
remove partitions allows you to describe

522
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:20,159
uh stable equilibrium States in which

523
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:22,520
you have the coexistence of parts of the

524
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:28,399
system that are in different intensive

525
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:29,320
States for example think of uh

526
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,000
a

527
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,720
pot

528
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,679
uh with water

529
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,000
inside and it's on the

530
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,799
stove and so you have a heating below

531
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,159
and there is boiling you you no boiling

532
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,200
will uh produce

533
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,360
bubbles these

534
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:58,240
bubbles will go to the

535
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:00,080
surface and may generate drops

536
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,760
if there is if the boiling is

537
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,200
sufficiently vigorous generate drops so

538
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,200
this is

539
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,519
a it's not really a stable equum state

540
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,399
but you can approximate the

541
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,159
properties uh with those of of a stable

542
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,679
equilibrium

543
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,320
State uh at least after a while that you

544
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,880
have um stopped the heating so you don't

545
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,960
have a as you get a sort of uniform

546
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,679
temperature uniform uh pressure but you

547
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,440
still have some drops and uh and Bubbles

548
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:39,080
drops in the in the vapor and bubbles in

549
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:43,440
the liquid okay so this is a complicated

550
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,240
system to describe but conceptually the

551
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,519
simple system model allows you to do the

552
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,360
following uh I can imagine

553
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,399
to take another

554
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,279
pot my my model pot so to

555
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,760
speak it's a mental image of that thing

556
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:06,440
and let me take a uh a physical

557
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:11,080
partition that um

558
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,080
runs at the interface between liquid and

559
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,039
vapor and as you know includ in

560
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,399
inserting that

561
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,360
partition doesn't

562
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:25,679
cost so you will already see that that

563
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,760
doesn't cost means you're neglecting the

564
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,519
simple system model is neglecting also

565
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:36,039
the the surface tension effects

566
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,039
because that interface does

567
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,240
matter but not within the simple system

568
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,760
model so I can take this and uh and

569
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,760
think of putting it

570
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:53,360
here then I take another um um Bubble

571
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,799
and uh and uh sorry let me let me put

572
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,279
them up here okay so I take all the

573
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,840
bubbles and I put them

574
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,799
there I also need to change the shape a

575
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,799
bit so that it feels the same space and

576
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,640
also here this I can take larger areas

577
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,080
essentially all the continuous area that

578
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,399
doesn't contain drops and put it there

579
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:22,720
So eventually what I managed to do is to

580
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:25,279
put all the vapor here and all the

581
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,279
liquid

582
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,600
here usually we use use these letters to

583
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,880
to represent

584
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,960
that okay so I've

585
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,240
generated two

586
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,200
regions in which there are no

587
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,679
inhomogeneities whereas here the

588
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,880
inhomogeneity stands from the fact that

589
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,240
as you know there is a huge difference

590
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,120
in density for example which is one of

591
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,200
the Intensive uh

592
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,320
properties uh like a factor of a

593
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:02,240
thousand between the density of the

594
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:07,600
liquid and the density of the vapor

595
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:13,240
so um this is an an inhomogeneous or

596
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,240
erogeneous uh situation that can be

597
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:22,200
represented uh certainly not in a

598
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,880
uniform um intensive state but I can

599
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:28,399
group the various intensive states that

600
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:32,760
are present in my multiple phase state

601
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:36,639
into just uh areas that we call

602
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,360
phases that are locally homogeneous so

603
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:42,039
the

604
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:48,440
F phase is the collection of

605
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:51,919
all the uh parts of my uh system that

606
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,000
have the same intensive State like the

607
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,440
liquid high

608
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,600
density uh and this G is the collection

609
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,760
of all the other uh parts that share

610
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,399
this other intensive

611
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:11,639
State and if you have a triple

612
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:14,840
point suppose you also have ice here

613
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:19,039
because we are at the proper

614
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:25,159
pressure okay if I have also ice I need

615
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:29,159
also to uh produce a third

616
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,159
phase okay

617
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,080
so that defines the idea of

618
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:43,000
phase and then as you know there is this

619
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:48,360
uh famous Gibbs phase

620
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,360
Rule and here is how uh it

621
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,480
follows all

622
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:04,000
right one one way of looking at at this

623
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,679
is that let's see what

624
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,679
happens let's choose this set of

625
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,880
variables that are uh the variables that

626
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,519
describe uh

627
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:23,000
this equilibrium

628
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,559
State temperature and pressure I select

629
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,679
them because I assume that all the

630
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:32,559
various parts are in a um the various

631
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,600
phases must be in mutal equilibrium

632
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,039
therefore they must be at the same

633
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:43,399
temperature for the overall system to be

634
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:46,639
uh in a uh stable equum State because as

635
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:51,440
we said we consider the overall system

636
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:53,720
as composite of the

637
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,880
phases and they are in mutual

638
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,600
equilibrium so the conditions for Mutual

639
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,679
equilibrium are equality of pressures

640
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,039
pressure because they can exchange

641
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:06,559
volume equality of temperature because

642
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,559
they can exchange

643
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,119
energy and the quality of chemical

644
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,240
potentials the Intensive

645
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:23,000
States uh that are present

646
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,480
here the number of independent

647
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,520
properties that Define intensive state

648
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:34,960
is this much

649
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:39,520
is uh TP plus plus the um

650
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,520
composition uh of each of the

651
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,560
the of each of the

652
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,839
phases because yeah here I consider a

653
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,040
simple system in which a simple

654
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,960
situation which the substance is only

655
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,000
water but you could have also a mixture

656
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,880
uh uh we will do that uh as we uh

657
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,760
approach the the second part of the

658
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,760
course this is already useful for that

659
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
part

660
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,040
so so these

661
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,440
are the Bas

662
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,400
variables uh

663
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,320
however they're not all truly

664
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,720
independent because first of all the mo

665
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,400
fractions by alus

666
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,800
definition must sum up to

667
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,640
one so so for each of the

668
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:39,359
phases for example for the summation

669
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:41,200
here is I only have R minus one more

670
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,880
fractions that

671
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,400
are

672
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,640
independent because the the LA the last

673
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,880
one can computed can be computed by as

674
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,960
one minus the summation of the

675
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,319
others

676
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,640
plus we also have the fact that the

677
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:59,640
chemical potentials

678
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,520
must be

679
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,000
equal so I need to have a quality of

680
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,440
chemical potential between the F the

681
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,359
phases for each of the constituents that

682
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:19,160
can be exchanged and here there are no

683
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,200
membranes or things that uh disallow the

684
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,240
exchange of types of particles they can

685
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,720
all be

686
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:30,880
exchanged and therefore I know I have

687
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,359
have to satisfy the chemical potential

688
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:38,119
equality for Mutual stable

689
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,119
equilibrium for each type of

690
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:47,680
constituents you see actually here the

691
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:50,280
reason why I have uh chosen as

692
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,480
independent uh as candidates for

693
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,200
independent variables a temperature

694
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,880
pressure and the mole fractals because

695
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,800
we proved the the that the chemical

696
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,800
potentials are functions of this TP and

697
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,040
Y and as we know

698
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,160
from the chemical potentials we can

699
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,160
compute uh we will see that we can

700
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,640
compute all uh the

701
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,640
properties at least

702
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,000
the yeah all the

703
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:28,119
properties

704
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and because we proved that

705
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,359
the chemical potentials are derivatives

706
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,760
of the G free energy which is one of the

707
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,599
characteristic functions the transforms

708
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,280
of the fundamental

709
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:45,720
relution all right so now it's just a

710
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:50,720
matter of counting how many do I did I

711
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:53,480
start with so it's Q * R is the mo

712
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,720
fractions plus two temperature and

713
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,680
pressure then I have to

714
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:02,319
subtract Q relations because of this

715
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,240
condition here and then I have to

716
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:08,960
subtract as many equations I have here

717
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,920
now the equal sign each equal sign

718
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,920
counts for an equation so uh I have q

719
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,440
phases so it's Q minus one and I have R

720
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,520
lines here because I have have one one

721
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,160
line like this for each type of

722
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:28,440
constituent so so it's Q - 1 * R and

723
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,680
then so if you subtract from that 2 + RQ

724
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,599
subtract q and subtract subtract Q -1 *

725
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,760
R you are

726
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:42,680
left with uh this r + 2 minus Q which is

727
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,920
the soall variance it's the real number

728
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,920
of independent variable intensive

729
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,880
properties and this is assuming that we

730
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,760
have no chemical equilibri chemical

731
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,640
reactions if we also have chemical

732
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:02,240
reactions

733
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:05,119
we will see that there is a um one

734
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,920
additional uh equation which we will

735
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:13,000
call the chemical equilibrium uh

736
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,520
condition for each independent reaction

737
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,960
in play in your system and so you'll

738
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,440
have to subtract also let call it Z that

739
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,480
number of independent chemical reactions

740
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,880
you have to

741
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,079
subtract uh this to get the

742
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,560
actual variant

743
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,760
for

744
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,520
example we take a pure substance like um

745
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,520
like

746
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,359
water so pure substance means only one

747
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,839
more fraction and of course one M

748
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,599
fraction is equal to one that's 100% of

749
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:51,640
that

750
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,640
substance so that's not really a

751
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,640
variable the Gibs um phase rule says

752
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,040
that the in defended variables are 3

753
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,040
minus

754
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,760
Q

755
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,319
so so for

756
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,560
example if I have a single

757
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:17,280
phase now single phase means that it's

758
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,640
all water for example

759
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,720
homogeneous it means that every every

760
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,400
point in my stable equilibrium State no

761
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,760
matter where I go and make my little

762
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,839
partition I I will find an intensive

763
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,280
state that it is equal to every where

764
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:41,839
else so homogeneous single phase is

765
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:45,960
homogeneous same intensive State

766
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:49,040
everywhere so with Q equals 1 one

767
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:54,119
phase uh the variance is 3 minus one so

768
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:56,680
it's it's two that means that if I have

769
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:59,079
if I am in that uh if I have a liquid

770
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:03,160
state

771
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:05,040
I can and I want to change that stable

772
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,160
equilibrium state to a neighboring

773
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,640
stable equilibrium State I can

774
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,599
move in two directions I can change two

775
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,280
variables so I can change for example

776
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:18,280
the temperature and the pressure

777
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,319
independently if I have two

778
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,359
phases like

779
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:30,960
this well without the eyes

780
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:33,000
and I want to move to another

781
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,440
neighboring stable equilibrium state

782
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,560
with the same two phases so for example

783
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,920
liquid and Vapor I want to move to an

784
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,079
adjacent stable equilibrium State again

785
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,480
with liquid and

786
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,280
Vapor I cannot do it by arbitrarily

787
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,960
changing both the temperature and the

788
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,720
pressure I can change only one and the

789
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,680
other must be tuned the the the change

790
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,040
of the other must be tuned in in a

791
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,119
proper way because

792
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,079
because that's because I need to follow

793
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,280
the condition for the imposed by the

794
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,280
chemical potential

795
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:13,480
equality and which is written here I

796
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,720
need that chemical potential equality to

797
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,119
remain satisfied and therefore if I

798
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,920
change

799
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,319
t uh that imposes a change in p and in

800
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,240
fact this relation between temperature

801
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,760
and pressure for two phase States is

802
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,599
what we call the saturation relation

803
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,520
pressure and temperature are related by

804
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:36,520
saturation if I have three

805
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,800
phases and I want to move from a stable

806
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,280
equilibrium state with those three

807
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,880
phases to another stable equilibrium

808
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,760
state with the same three

809
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,040
phases and

810
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,040
different temperatures or pressure I

811
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,240
cannot because the values is zero there

812
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,720
are no neighboring states with different

813
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,720
values of

814
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,280
tnp

815
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,319
because the equality of the chemical

816
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,000
potentials here I I have two equalities

817
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:16,800
and the two variables are T and P so

818
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,160
that fixes uniquely the value of TP at

819
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,960
which you can have those three

820
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,680
phases that's the triple

821
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,200
point this is better represented for

822
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,960
example this is the pressure temperature

823
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,960
diagram for

824
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:42,599
water so if we have um in this

825
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:46,400
area uh this is the vapor area and if we

826
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,440
have uh some vapor in this state I can

827
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,079
move to

828
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,520
adjacent uh conditions in which I still

829
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,359
have a

830
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,240
vapor but different pressure and

831
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,160
temperature and I can move in both

832
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:02,079
directions here so I have two directions

833
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,480
in which I can move that mean that's the

834
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:09,559
meaning of variance variance equals

835
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,640
two along here are the the line of

836
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:15,040
coexistence of liquid so inside the

837
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,079
liquid also the Varian is too and also

838
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,599
inside the

839
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,440
solid these are the homogeneous single

840
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:22,520
phase

841
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,680
States along these curve which is

842
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,720
represented by the P saturation uh

843
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,680
relation between pressure and

844
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,319
temperature

845
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,599
uh we have the coexistence of liquid and

846
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:38,680
vapor and as you see the variance is one

847
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,200
if I want to move to a neighboring

848
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,000
equilibrium state with different

849
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,680
pressure I also have to adjust the

850
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,880
changing temperature so as to follow

851
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,880
this

852
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:52,520
curve up to the critical point above

853
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,559
that there is no uh distinction between

854
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,839
the liquid and the vapor phase and

855
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:02,000
therefore it is possible as you know

856
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,319
to go all the way from liquid to vapor

857
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,680
and vice

858
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:09,920
versa by going uh this path in which

859
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,559
there is

860
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,400
no

861
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:18,920
sharp uh there is no two-phase uh

862
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:23,599
conditions you so the the liquid becomes

863
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:27,400
uh smoothly uh vapor and vice versa

864
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,839
without phase separation butas if if you

865
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,920
if you if you if you do if you go from

866
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:36,760
here to there at a certain

867
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:38,400
stage like we do when we boil uh we boil

868
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,720
at

869
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,760
constant atmospheric pressure so I think

870
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:47,079
let's see where is there should be one

871
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,040
somewhere uh

872
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,160
for bar one bar is atmospheric pressure

873
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:57,160
more or less so if

874
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,760
I go from here and then I heat up at

875
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,960
constant pressure I move to the right in

876
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,760
the diagram at a certain stage I'll

877
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,800
reach the two-phase uh condition in

878
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:12,559
which the the water begins to

879
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:15,640
boil and uh as you know it U the

880
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:18,359
temperature gets stuck to that value

881
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,720
until it's over boiled and then you can

882
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:24,800
still heat up and the temperature will

883
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,680
begin to increase so here essentially

884
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,599
when you

885
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,760
have the two phases the the the only way

886
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,240
in which the

887
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:38,400
system likes to stay in equilibrium is

888
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,640
to separate into vapor and uh uh and uh

889
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,640
and

890
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,720
liquid triple point is this one as you

891
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,200
know there is no adjacent values of

892
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,200
temperature and pressure but there are

893
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,920
other triple

894
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,960
points if ice

895
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,760
has many

896
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,520
uh stable some are also meta stable for

897
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,040
example ice 4 is not present here

898
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:13,400
because it's metast stable but uh these

899
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:17,480
are stable forms and um and therefore

900
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,680
you may find several uh triple points

901
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:23,680
you can have no more than three

902
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:28,839
coexisting phases for a pure substance

903
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,839
because the variance cannot go negative

904
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,160
okay now

905
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:45,400
remember that we gave these

906
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:47,480
relations uh that allow to reconstruct

907
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,240
the fundamental relation and in

908
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:53,319
particular energy entropy and uh

909
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:58,119
enthalpy which is useful for Bulow

910
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:58,119
applications uh when you start

911
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,760
from

912
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:08,440
um if you have the expressions of

913
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,200
how uh the coefficient of thermal

914
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:14,680
expansion

915
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,599
is isobaric expansion is ismal

916
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,400
compressibility with capacity of

917
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:22,160
constant pressure how these things

918
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,960
depend on tnp and this was were the

919
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:28,760
relations if we

920
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,760
have a pure subst

921
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,680
for example we could simply divide by

922
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,359
the

923
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:42,559
mass of that uh that we have in our

924
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:45,319
system and so we can rewrite so

925
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:49,799
e becomes little

926
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:52,559
e which I write U because we said that

927
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:54,520
we use the letter U for energy just to

928
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,240
remind ourselves that we are within the

929
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,240
simple system model

930
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,520
uh so the the heat capacity becomes the

931
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,760
specific

932
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,280
heat or specific heat

933
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,799
capacity uh this the volume becomes a

934
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,839
specific volume here and

935
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:18,720
here okay and so you get this expression

936
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,720
that allow you to

937
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,000
compute for any substance any pure

938
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:28,160
substance in the simple system model the

939
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,760
various properties

940
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,559
and from

941
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,599
that we have some

942
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:39,520
extreme simple examples that simple

943
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,520
behaviors that we call Ideal

944
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,359
Behavior the first one is the uh model

945
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,839
the ideal incompressible solid or fluid

946
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:53,839
model in which we

947
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:56,799
assume that the specific volume is

948
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:59,079
approximately constant

949
00:49:56,799 --> 00:50:01,880
because of the

950
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:04,400
incompressibility uh it's not it is not

951
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:07,720
strictly true because the solid as you

952
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:13,359
know can be compressed the young modulus

953
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:15,400
of elasticity describes precisely that

954
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,040
but for

955
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:22,480
some applications or for some purposes

956
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:24,480
so for thermal aspects you may neglect

957
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,559
uh that changing volume and if you can

958
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:31,559
neglect that changing volume then

959
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:34,839
the compressibility and the

960
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:37,040
um coefficient of expansion are

961
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:38,640
approximately zero so if you take the

962
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,200
limit that they assume that they are

963
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,480
exactly

964
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:46,000
zero and they and that they go to zero

965
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,760
in such a way that from the my relation

966
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,640
you also have that

967
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,640
um it doesn't

968
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,880
um so so it is well behaved that because

969
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,599
there is a r ratio in the mayor relation

970
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:03,720
there is a ratio of where there is a

971
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:07,160
alpha P I think squared at the at the

972
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:09,240
numerator divide by Capa T and so you

973
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:13,119
have a zero over

974
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:18,000
zero so if that limit is is appropriate

975
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:18,000
then the specific Heats become

976
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:25,559
equal and I you can show that it's they

977
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:28,880
also just a function of

978
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:31,799
temperature how do you show that well

979
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,559
here it is if

980
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:36,839
uh if Kappa and

981
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,559
Alpha are

982
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:44,160
zero this coefficient here is always

983
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:46,599
zero so that means that the internal

984
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,839
energy is a function of temperature but

985
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:49,839
not a function of of

986
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,319
pressure and since the specific heat at

987
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,520
constant volume is the partial of the

988
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:59,720
energy with respect to temp

989
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,920
temperature

990
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,559
um it is a function it's also a function

991
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,079
of of of temperature Since U is a

992
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:12,680
function of T

993
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,680
only and if if we go here for

994
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,920
entropy that's true also for entropy so

995
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:22,200
if Alpha is equal to

996
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,200
zero entropy is a function only of the

997
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,680
temperature it's not true for the

998
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,640
enthalpy though if Alpha is equal equ Al

999
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,480
to zero the enthalpy depends on both

1000
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,720
temperature and

1001
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,480
pressure so for a

1002
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:39,640
liquid the enthalpy depends on

1003
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,720
tnp and here is the expressions for the

1004
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,280
D DS DH

1005
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,280
which uh are

1006
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:52,200
the come from these relations here when

1007
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,520
you substitute um with assumptions for

1008
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,079
sorry

1009
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:00,119
oops okay

1010
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,920
all right now of course if you have from

1011
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,799
these Expressions you may if you need to

1012
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,960
compute the differences you just do the

1013
00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:09,400
integral because C varies with

1014
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,480
temperature do do some

1015
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,799
integrals uh sometimes U you're lucky

1016
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,000
and the specific Heats are not functions

1017
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:18,720
of temperature then in that case if you

1018
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,520
in the range of your application you can

1019
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:24,319
assume constant specific heat the

1020
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,240
integral is easy and U sometimes you'll

1021
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:30,280
also call that perfect Behavior

1022
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,839
it's perfect only for the purpose of the

1023
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,960
calculation because it makes it easy not

1024
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:37,760
that there is anything better uh from

1025
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:42,240
the physics point of

1026
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:46,720
view now the ideal gas model is another

1027
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:49,240
uh of course a very well known uh and

1028
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,240
useful

1029
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,920
model if you assume this relation for

1030
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,799
the equation of State

1031
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,760
we already proved that Capa T is one of

1032
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:04,920
the pressure Alpha p is one of the

1033
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:09,960
temperature and the mayor relation

1034
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:13,480
becomes that CP is equal to cv+

1035
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,480
R in that

1036
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,240
case

1037
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:27,079
um let's go back once more

1038
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:29,680
here since Alpha is 1 / t

1039
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:32,640
this coefficient in front of the of the

1040
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,920
pressure variation is zero so it means

1041
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,440
that the enthalpy is a function of

1042
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,440
temperature

1043
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:45,520
only and here also for the

1044
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:47,520
energy Capa is 1 / P so P * 1 / p is 1

1045
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Alpha is 1 / T So T

1046
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,240
minus t * 1 T is 1 so 1 - 1 is zero so

1047
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,359
also the energy is a function of

1048
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:00,240
temperature only whereas for the entropy

1049
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:03,400
uh this Alpha is one / p and from that

1050
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:06,240
you see that the entropy in the case of

1051
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,480
an ideal gas is a function of both

1052
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:12,920
temperature and pressure and here you

1053
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:16,240
can integrate that I mean this is how

1054
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:20,839
that formula appears comes

1055
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:23,640
out and um if you use the um mayor

1056
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:26,079
relation to switch from

1057
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,200
H sometimes it is useful instead of

1058
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:33,480
working with a specific at constant

1059
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:37,400
pressure uh using um that constant

1060
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:40,119
volume because maybe in your problem uh

1061
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,960
one of these variables remains zero and

1062
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:45,640
so it it you can choose either of these

1063
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,720
Alternatives and again if the specific

1064
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,000
kits are not function of temperature

1065
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,200
which happens

1066
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,760
in some uh cases

1067
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,839
um then you can integrate easily

1068
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,599
otherwise you have to do the integrals I

1069
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:01,599
didn't write them

1070
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:13,839
explicitly within this ideal gas

1071
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:16,440
model you may realize that um the way um

1072
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:22,240
uh the molecules of the

1073
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:24,520
gas accumulate uh or carry the energy uh

1074
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:28,039
is mainly through their degrees of

1075
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,200
freedom so uh certainly there is the

1076
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:32,920
translational and the rotational degrees

1077
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,280
of freedom and then if you go to

1078
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,920
sufficiently high temperatures you also

1079
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,799
have the vibrational degrees of freedom

1080
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,799
as well as the electronic degrees of

1081
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,799
freedom

1082
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,680
so at relatively low temperatures not

1083
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:57,720
too low um the vibrational and

1084
00:56:52,680 --> 00:57:01,480
electronic degrees of freedom are less

1085
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:04,760
active there is sufficient ability to

1086
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,799
for for your molecules to accumulate

1087
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,720
whatever energy has to be distributed

1088
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:13,880
within the system by using the

1089
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:17,960
translational and um

1090
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,960
rotational uh

1091
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:22,920
structure

1092
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,359
and each degrees of freedom contributes

1093
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:30,240
to the specific

1094
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:32,440
heat uh a factor of 1 half remember the

1095
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,200
famous 1 half KT that's the energy that

1096
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:40,240
is carried is the equip partition energy

1097
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,760
that is carried by h degre of Freedom at

1098
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,640
equilibrium

1099
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:47,039
so uh if you divide by T if you take the

1100
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,920
derivative respect to t you left with 1

1101
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:53,599
half of K and K is the bman constant

1102
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,760
which one when you multiply it by the

1103
00:57:53,599 --> 00:58:00,720
avocad number becomes the gas constant

1104
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:04,000
so for a gas that only

1105
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,920
has translational degrees of freedom so

1106
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,440
it can move the the

1107
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,079
molecules are pointwise and can move in

1108
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,799
the three directions you have the three

1109
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:16,079
translational degrees of freedom so you

1110
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:19,920
have one half of our contribution for

1111
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:24,119
each of them so the specific

1112
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,720
heat uh contributed by those degrees of

1113
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,960
freedom is just three um

1114
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,960
half of

1115
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:39,720
R and then if this is CV then CP is CV

1116
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,119
plus r so the three becomes five halves

1117
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:45,160
gamma the

1118
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:48,359
famous ratio of specific he is therefore

1119
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,359
5 over three which is

1120
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:00,720
1.67 right

1121
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:06,000
now other molecules for example uh

1122
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:10,119
oxygen or nitrogen they're be

1123
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:16,359
Atomic and uh these molecules also have

1124
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:20,240
the ability to uh car to to to put

1125
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:22,440
energy uh yes in the vibration but most

1126
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,200
important here we said that we

1127
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,520
interested in the

1128
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,520
rotation so the rotation of the

1129
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,520
molecule

1130
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:43,280
okay so if you look at

1131
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:45,400
um the principal axis of uh uh

1132
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,280
this thing

1133
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:56,079
here uh the moment of universal for for

1134
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:58,160
for rotation uh is large in uh uh in two

1135
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:01,240
directions and very small in the other

1136
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:04,880
one because along when the molecule

1137
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:08,880
rotates along the axis of alignment of

1138
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:12,799
X2 atoms it doesn't have uh since the

1139
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:15,960
atoms are concentrated in very small

1140
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:19,240
radi uh the mass is concentrated there

1141
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,039
so the moment of inertia is small so if

1142
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:27,799
you multiply like

1143
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:30,359
uh moment times the uh angular

1144
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:33,480
um

1145
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:39,319
velocity probably squared

1146
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:42,880
and U that since that m is important

1147
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:44,400
only in the two directions where the the

1148
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,160
molecule

1149
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:51,799
rotates uh uh perpendicular to the axis

1150
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,960
of alignment and so you have only in

1151
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:57,599
this molecule with aligned atoms you

1152
01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:00,000
have only two uh additional degrees of

1153
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:03,119
freedom in which the molecule can carry

1154
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,319
the energy and that's why you go from

1155
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:11,200
three plus two to five five

1156
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:13,680
halves and that makes gamma equals 1.4

1157
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,160
this is typical of oxygen nitrogen

1158
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,160
therefore

1159
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:24,839
air more complex molecules like CO2

1160
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:32,160
where the

1161
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:36,799
atoms are not um

1162
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:40,559
aligned enjoy the possibility of uh um

1163
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:42,760
of storing energy uh also in the

1164
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,480
rotations in The three principal axis of

1165
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:49,119
rotation all three have a non-

1166
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:53,799
negligible moment of

1167
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,599
of and therefore you add another three 3

1168
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:59,119
+

1169
01:01:54,599 --> 01:02:01,000
3 have like six halfes that's three R

1170
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,279
that's gamma equals

1171
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,520
1.33 for example the products of

1172
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:08,359
combustion also

1173
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,480
H2O is uh

1174
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:11,799
similar and as the products of

1175
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,559
combustion are

1176
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:18,480
mainly uh done with uh uh well not

1177
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,279
exactly because

1178
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:25,319
um you have

1179
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:27,839
Co but okay let's say that if you have

1180
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:27,839
uh

1181
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:37,119
water uh in carbon dioxide uh then they

1182
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:40,400
are belong they both belong to this

1183
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:42,599
category uh if you have like most of the

1184
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,119
times also air you are somewhere in

1185
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:48,720
between here and there so it's a

1186
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:51,960
weighted sum of 1.4

1187
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:54,680
1.33 so these numbers allow you just by

1188
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:57,359
looking at the the molecule to to get a

1189
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:03,160
good uh rough

1190
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:08,960
immediate idea of what the specific heat

1191
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:11,680
is but of course as you go higher in

1192
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:15,440
temperatures various thresholds you can

1193
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:18,680
U activate also the various vibrational

1194
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:22,400
modes of the molecule uh and even higher

1195
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:25,599
you can also uh shift the electrons from

1196
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,400
the lower uh shell to the higher shells

1197
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:31,920
and that adds

1198
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:34,240
to specific heat so the specific heat as

1199
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,160
we are interpreting it as is the

1200
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,720
capacity represents the capacity of our

1201
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:43,359
molecule

1202
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,359
to store the

1203
01:03:44,839 --> 01:03:50,760
energy yeah these are expressions that

1204
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:57,720
are U often used when

1205
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:57,720
you assume is anthropic uh uh

1206
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:06,880
change so if the entropy doesn't change

1207
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:10,200
um you just set from those equations

1208
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:13,400
here how that the entropy remains

1209
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:17,200
constant and you get these expressions

1210
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:22,119
and since R is CP minus

1211
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:24,200
CV um that's how you can express the

1212
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:27,119
setting equal to zero this in terms of

1213
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:30,359
just the ratio of the Heat capacit gamma

1214
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,359
that's why gamma appears

1215
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,520
here

1216
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,520
now going back to two

1217
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,119
phases how do

1218
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,079
we

1219
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:59,000
for well actually how do we prove this

1220
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,440
relation here uh that um connects the

1221
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,559
pressure and the

1222
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,960
temperature this is called the clus

1223
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:08,880
claperon relation and it gives the slope

1224
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:12,279
of the saturation line on that pressure

1225
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,240
temperature diagram that we have

1226
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:17,319
uh shown

1227
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,680
before and it it it allows you to

1228
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:21,240
compute

1229
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:23,119
it

1230
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:28,480
using the

1231
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:31,839
ratio of the enalia of the change of

1232
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:35,160
phase and the volume of the change of

1233
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:35,160
phase and the

1234
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:45,079
temperature and the way you obtain this

1235
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:47,720
relation is uh well it follows again

1236
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:50,160
from the condition of equality of

1237
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,720
chemical potentials of the single

1238
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:57,920
substance we have water in the two

1239
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:02,359
phases so it's it's this relation here

1240
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:04,760
so one way to write it is to

1241
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:07,440
take the

1242
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:10,400
differential of the left hand

1243
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,279
side and put it equal to the

1244
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,920
differential of the right hand

1245
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:20,200
side so it's the

1246
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:25,079
MU because we have uh you

1247
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:26,359
see the differential of uh D mu can be

1248
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:29,240
written

1249
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:29,240
uh if you if

1250
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:34,599
you this is not written as in terms of

1251
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,680
differential but you can see that it

1252
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:38,400
also represents the differential this is

1253
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:44,079
the Gibbs DM

1254
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:46,400
relation okay but it's also viewed as

1255
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,960
the differential of the chemical

1256
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,440
potential as a function of temperature

1257
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,680
and

1258
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:55,680
pressure and the Gib relation shows that

1259
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,680
those the partial derivatives of mu

1260
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:02,559
respect to T is minus s and partial

1261
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:06,400
derivative of mu with respect to P is V

1262
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:09,960
okay so if I want to move from a state

1263
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,960
in which I have these two phases

1264
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,160
coexisting one and two could be liquid

1265
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:22,640
and Vapor or ice and water

1266
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,640
or vapor and

1267
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:29,880
size and I want to move move to another

1268
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:31,960
state in which I Chang the temperature

1269
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,599
therefore also change the

1270
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:37,359
pressure then it means that these the

1271
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:40,039
two differences also the the the change

1272
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:42,880
in chemical potential must be must be

1273
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:45,319
the same so that if they were equal at

1274
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,960
the beginning they are equal also after

1275
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:49,359
and and therefore the two phases are

1276
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:54,079
still in mutal

1277
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:57,920
equilibrium okay so if you equate D mu y

1278
01:07:54,079 --> 01:08:01,319
d mu1 to with the mu2

1279
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:05,680
here so eliminate these two because they

1280
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:08,760
must be equal uh and you see you get a

1281
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:11,960
relation between D DT and DP that

1282
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:14,279
involves the differences in the specific

1283
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,239
entropies for the two phases and the

1284
01:08:14,279 --> 01:08:19,440
differences in the specific volumes

1285
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:22,040
which are the coefficients

1286
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:26,199
here then how do we go from here to

1287
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:29,000
there well again the equation

1288
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:30,279
the equality for Mutual equilibrium of

1289
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,440
the chemical

1290
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:34,440
potentials remember that the chemical

1291
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:43,040
potentials uh for a pure

1292
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,120
substance is equal to the Gibs free

1293
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,440
energy specifically Gibs free energy so

1294
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,159
it's

1295
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:53,400
I which can also be written as enthalpy

1296
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:57,440
minus TS okay this is true

1297
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,440
only for the pure substance

1298
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:03,120
so if the chemical potentials are equal

1299
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,880
it means that H minus TS must be equal

1300
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:09,679
in the two phases and therefore with

1301
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:12,080
this equality I can extract T and it's

1302
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:14,600
equal to the ratio of the enthalpy of

1303
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:17,239
the change of phase uh over the entropy

1304
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,239
of the change of

1305
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:26,719
phase and so I can substitute instead of

1306
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:29,920
the entropy I I put the enthalpy of the

1307
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,920
change of phase divided by

1308
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:43,080
T let's be even more specific suppose we

1309
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:46,159
just have a liquid and vapor and then

1310
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:48,359
how do we compute the properties of a of

1311
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:52,440
a system in which I have two

1312
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:55,480
phases or three well as we said thanks

1313
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,679
to the simple system model and this idea

1314
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:02,440
of inserting and removing partition for

1315
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:05,880
free uh we have represented this kind of

1316
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:09,400
complex situation into a simpler one it

1317
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:11,560
is a composite system of as many

1318
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:15,080
subsystems as there are

1319
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,640
phases in the in the slide here we have

1320
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:20,520
only

1321
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,320
two it's a composite system so for the

1322
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,480
properties of the composite

1323
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,360
system the additive properties it's easy

1324
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:30,560
for example the

1325
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,880
volume it's the volume of uh one plus

1326
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,920
the volume of the other the energy is AD

1327
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:38,920
is an additive property so the energy of

1328
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,679
one phase plus the energy of the other

1329
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:43,239
the entropy also is an additive

1330
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:45,000
properties property the entropy of one

1331
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:48,960
plus entropy the

1332
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,400
enthalpy here it's also in general it is

1333
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,440
not an addictive property but here

1334
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,280
because the both systems have the same

1335
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:59,800
uh pressure

1336
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,800
then it it becomes

1337
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:09,520
additive and then we we we would be done

1338
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,080
except that uh in terms of expressing

1339
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,960
how

1340
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,800
much of the substance we have in one

1341
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:20,000
phase and how much we have on in the

1342
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:23,440
other sometimes we it is often used I

1343
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,520
mean sometimes it's useful to um work in

1344
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:30,400
terms of fractions

1345
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,600
so we call for example Vapor fraction or

1346
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:38,159
steam

1347
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:41,920
quality uh the ratio the amount of mass

1348
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:46,600
that we that is in the in the in the

1349
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,600
vapor phase over the overall mass of our

1350
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:56,840
system and uh by doing

1351
01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:00,400
that and substituting in dividing here

1352
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:03,440
the in this uh properties the additive

1353
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:09,480
properties we can compute the specific

1354
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:13,440
uh properties in terms of this Mass uh

1355
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:16,040
fraction and of the property specific

1356
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:19,400
properties that are that characterize

1357
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:21,679
each of the phases at that temperature

1358
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,679
and

1359
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:28,800
pressure so these are typically called

1360
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:32,719
the with the S with the subscript gnf

1361
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:36,080
and the difference is called the uh

1362
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:39,440
vaporization for for for example hfg is

1363
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:42,120
the enthalpy of vaporization sfg is the

1364
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,040
entropy of vaporization and if we go

1365
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:47,679
back to this expression here we have two

1366
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:50,600
and one is f and g this says that the

1367
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:53,639
temperature is equal to the ratio of the

1368
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:57,120
eny of of the vaporization over the

1369
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:57,120
entropy vaporization

1370
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:08,120
these properties VG and

1371
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:10,880
VF are listed in the sting tables for

1372
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:14,440
the for for for water or in the

1373
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:17,040
equivalent of a stin tables for other

1374
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:19,520
substances or maybe they are represented

1375
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,960
by

1376
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:25,679
correlations for example the stin tables

1377
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:29,120
that were developed by K and K based in

1378
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:34,800
the in the in the 30s

1379
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:37,679
1930 uh were correlations were based on

1380
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:41,239
correlations with some

1381
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:45,199
40 uh parameters that were were used to

1382
01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:49,639
correlate the experimental data for

1383
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:52,199
water over the full range of um

1384
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:57,040
applicable I mean

1385
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:57,040
important um values

1386
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:04,800
so we needed a lot of experimental data

1387
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:08,280
and with with those four paramet 40

1388
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:11,239
parameters you can uh actually construct

1389
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,239
the entire s

1390
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:18,000
tables now

1391
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,760
pictorially uh you can represent

1392
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,760
properties of

1393
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,800
substances of course

1394
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,520
yes you could do it in

1395
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:33,880
a at most

1396
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:37,400
three-dimensional uh

1397
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:41,280
visualization and pictorially this is

1398
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:44,960
what uh uh an energy versus volume

1399
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:47,639
versus entropy diagram would look so

1400
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,800
it's like uh remember the E versus S

1401
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:55,040
diagram all right here we also add

1402
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,400
volume so if I fix volume this curve

1403
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,960
curve

1404
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:03,600
here is the curve that we uh usually

1405
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,120
would represent on aners Suess diagram

1406
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:09,159
for that particular value of the volume

1407
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:12,080
here is for another value of the

1408
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:14,520
volume we fix the entropy then you have

1409
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:17,679
energy versus volume and you follow this

1410
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:21,840
line the slope of this

1411
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,840
line is the negative of the

1412
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,280
pressure whereas the slope of that one

1413
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,280
is the

1414
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:36,840
temperature notice that um when you when

1415
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,840
we

1416
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:42,440
have for example at the triple

1417
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:46,040
point the triple

1418
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:48,560
point which is a a point on the pressure

1419
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:52,120
temperature

1420
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:56,000
diagram becomes

1421
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:58,480
a a planner region of triangle

1422
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,159
shape called the triple triple point

1423
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,159
triangle

1424
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:04,239
here

1425
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:10,800
because

1426
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:14,880
uh it's true that you can have a three

1427
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:18,080
the three phases only at one uh

1428
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:23,199
particular set of values of p and t but

1429
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:25,560
you may have uh many different states

1430
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:28,719
like that for example you you we have

1431
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,280
more ice less water and so on so all the

1432
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:33,800
various

1433
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:35,600
combinations give you uh two Mass

1434
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:38,440
fractions so I got two degrees of

1435
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,880
freedom and you can span within that

1436
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:44,880
triangle for example

1437
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:47,760
here you have almost all the

1438
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,760
vapor here you have almost all the

1439
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:54,120
liquid and here you almost on S and in

1440
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:55,639
between you have all the other all the

1441
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:58,560
uh possible

1442
01:16:55,639 --> 01:17:00,679
combination this is the region for

1443
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:03,320
liquid and Vapor coexistence this is

1444
01:17:00,679 --> 01:17:06,639
solid and Vapor

1445
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:09,520
coexistence this is the value of the

1446
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:11,679
critical isotherm so this is points that

1447
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,320
have the same temperature equal to the

1448
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,360
critical

1449
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:20,320
temperature and above that critical

1450
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:23,600
isotherm we change name from Vapor we

1451
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:26,719
call it gas there's no real physical

1452
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:28,920
distinction but

1453
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,320
conventionally usually you use the term

1454
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,400
gas

1455
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:36,920
where something like the ideal gas

1456
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:39,120
applies now if you this is a pictor

1457
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:41,280
pictorial representation if you uh try

1458
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,719
to do it for

1459
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,000
water and with the real property using

1460
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:49,280
the steam

1461
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,520
tables um this is how it looks and you

1462
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,520
have to realize that

1463
01:17:52,639 --> 01:18:00,239
uh since the specific volum volume spans

1464
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:05,040
over uh how many or maybe eight orders

1465
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:06,360
of magnitude in the interesting uh Parts

1466
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,880
not only

1467
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:11,520
because there is a factor of a thousand

1468
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:15,040
between the the the density of so the

1469
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:18,600
specific volume of the vapor and the the

1470
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:21,960
liquid but also you you as

1471
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:26,400
you so that would count only for uh

1472
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:30,080
three orders of magnitude here but at

1473
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,360
lower uh pressures that this difference

1474
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:35,679
becomes even more

1475
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:38,760
important um it's it's inconvenient you

1476
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:41,159
cannot do this on a linear scale so uh

1477
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:43,120
so that you see that the this which supp

1478
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:46,000
to be straight

1479
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,760
lines have become distorted into

1480
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,040
exponentials because uh we have used the

1481
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:54,159
logarithmic SC for for for a specific

1482
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,000
volume okay but so this this is still

1483
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:59,320
the triple

1484
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,159
Point uh

1485
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:07,199
triangle and excuse the Italian here but

1486
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:07,199
that was done for a booklet I have in

1487
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:14,080
Italian and obviously working with

1488
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:18,000
threedimensional diagrams is not uh

1489
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:20,880
useful so most people have uh people who

1490
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
work are with water have the DI a

1491
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,000
diagram of this sort

1492
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:30,360
um which is called the M diagram in the

1493
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:33,120
form of a poster on the wall of their

1494
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:36,159
offices and uh this is how the they

1495
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:39,320
compute the properties of of

1496
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:42,440
water and this is how uh I'm sure you

1497
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:45,679
you've probably done some homeworks for

1498
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:49,800
using this diagram in the old days of

1499
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,800
your undergraduate

1500
01:19:53,360 --> 01:20:00,159
thermodynamics this is

1501
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:02,840
another view it's like pressure versus

1502
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:05,520
volume and

1503
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:13,600
um yeah so I should change this because

1504
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:16,280
that uh uh I forgot to to update this

1505
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,880
Okay the reason I'm mentioning this is

1506
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:24,040
because sometimes yes so you is in order

1507
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:26,000
to to do this calculation here uh I I

1508
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,800
needed all the

1509
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,600
40

1510
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:34,040
parameters that Kenan used for the steam

1511
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:36,400
tables to obtain the real properties of

1512
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,199
water in the full range including

1513
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,280
drawing this Dy so this is the true

1514
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:44,639
thing for

1515
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:47,560
water uh there is a a much simpler model

1516
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:50,520
that covers at least qualitatively uh

1517
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:55,800
the liquid Vapor um

1518
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:58,440
State uh which is the Vander Val

1519
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:03,760
equation of

1520
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:06,440
state which looks like PV * R equals RT

1521
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:09,800
if it weren't for this additional term

1522
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:12,239
here and this additional uh subtracting

1523
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,239
term

1524
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:21,920
here the uh this would be like the ideal

1525
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:24,360
gas equation so R RS with the simple

1526
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,199
modification of the of of the equation

1527
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:30,080
of equation state for a gas for a

1528
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:33,400
perfect gas for an ideal gas uh

1529
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:35,679
correcting the volume we subtracting the

1530
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:39,639
co volume so it's essentially something

1531
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:42,679
that represents the volume not available

1532
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:46,159
uh to the particles because the

1533
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:50,040
particles themselves occupy some

1534
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,520
volume and this one that has to do with

1535
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:55,080
the

1536
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:58,000
attractive uh forces that

1537
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:00,360
that happen that are important and we'll

1538
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:05,000
return to this for example when we talk

1539
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:08,280
about the Leonard johnes uh potential

1540
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,159
but the electr

1541
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:15,159
electrostatics of molecules make it such

1542
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:17,040
that the electrons are attracted by the

1543
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:19,280
nuclei of the other molecule and so

1544
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:24,960
there are some attractive forces up to a

1545
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:28,400
certain stage and uh so this makes uh um

1546
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:31,560
an additional contribution here so if

1547
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:38,800
you if you use this expression

1548
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:41,400
here it gives you um a curve which is uh

1549
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:44,080
similar to the actual

1550
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:46,639
curve for the actual

1551
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:51,040
substance of course you cannot match

1552
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:53,080
everything so one way to is to choose it

1553
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,040
does

1554
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:58,560
uh in

1555
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:02,760
um a critical point and the critical

1556
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:05,320
point for the Wonder vales has this

1557
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:09,239
values that depends on the values of A

1558
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:13,199
and B so if I have

1559
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:18,199
a if I choose to select a and

1560
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:20,960
b uh using um the actual values for

1561
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:23,400
water for this for the critical pressure

1562
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:27,560
and the critical temperature I get two

1563
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:30,440
values of A and B I can uh have um a

1564
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,440
representation of

1565
01:23:31,159 --> 01:23:38,000
water it's not exactly good

1566
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:41,639
because there is also an expression for

1567
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,400
the Vander vals models of the uh

1568
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:47,400
specific volume at the critical point

1569
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,560
which is also a combination of A and B

1570
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:52,719
and uh if I use these

1571
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:55,880
values I it will not match so that's

1572
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:58,440
already a first error

1573
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:02,960
that I do

1574
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:07,280
but you see that sometimes simple models

1575
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:10,199
capture at least qualitatively part of

1576
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,199
the uh the

1577
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:19,360
physics it actually captures also an

1578
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,360
additional uh interesting

1579
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:27,159
part in this curves here are the

1580
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:37,679
isotherms okay this is the critical

1581
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:40,639
ISO and these are the other ISO terms as

1582
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:45,639
you go further away from the saturation

1583
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:45,639
region of the two-phase region this

1584
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:52,800
becomes

1585
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:56,360
iperol and that's the ideal gas

1586
01:24:52,800 --> 01:25:00,080
behavior but the thing happens here

1587
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:04,639
inside somehow this model allows you to

1588
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:07,639
extrapolate also inside of the

1589
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,639
saturation

1590
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:16,560
Dome and uh so you you may go this

1591
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:20,400
way then the model takes you

1592
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:25,040
up and then down again so we got to a

1593
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:26,960
minimum and the maximum here

1594
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:29,560
so that

1595
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:33,960
suggests that the for for as much as

1596
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,960
this uh equation represents some

1597
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:41,119
Physics uh it may be possible to have

1598
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:41,119
States this

1599
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:47,719
way the only problem is that they are

1600
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:50,560
not stable equilibrium

1601
01:25:47,719 --> 01:25:54,320
States

1602
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:57,119
because uh you see if you impose the

1603
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:00,159
quality of chemical potentials here if

1604
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:03,719
you look at the chemical go the chemical

1605
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:06,400
potential uh the equality is obtained

1606
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:09,719
only if you stop here with the liquid

1607
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,440
and you start here with the vapor and

1608
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:12,280
this

1609
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:17,800
is

1610
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:22,920
why uh when you do things in practice

1611
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:25,320
and you like boil water in a noisy

1612
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:28,440
situation uh this this is exactly the

1613
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:30,800
path that is followed the system

1614
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:34,199
realizes the liquid

1615
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:36,000
realizes that there is a vapor with the

1616
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:38,440
same chemical equilibrium in which it

1617
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:43,280
could it could

1618
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:43,280
boil and stay in mutual equilibrium

1619
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:51,119
with

1620
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:55,280
but in a less uh noisy environment you

1621
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:59,400
could also go down here so it is

1622
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:01,119
possible to generate these that would be

1623
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:04,480
metastable

1624
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:08,400
States states

1625
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:12,080
that uh in which the

1626
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:16,080
liquid didn't realize yet that there is

1627
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,080
a vapor in which it it could

1628
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:24,880
transform uh and also going back the

1629
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:25,760
other side she could go up this way

1630
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,159
The

1631
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:32,880
Vapor can go metast stable super

1632
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:32,880
saturated means it

1633
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:39,639
goes uh it it remains uh Vapor even if

1634
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:42,800
in in the region where in a noisy

1635
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:42,800
environment it would

1636
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:50,280
condense and this is actually

1637
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,920
experimentally uh

1638
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:54,960
achievable only up to this dotted line

1639
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,320
This dotted line is called the soal is

1640
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,320
called the

1641
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,320
spinodal

1642
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:05,719
curve and it is the locus of all the

1643
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,760
Minima on this side and the Maxima on

1644
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:09,639
that

1645
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:14,760
side

1646
01:28:09,639 --> 01:28:16,760
and is is because in the to the left so

1647
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:20,320
outside in this region

1648
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:22,600
between the spinodal curve and the

1649
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:27,520
saturation

1650
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:30,280
dome in this region the conditions for

1651
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,639
stability those second derivatives that

1652
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:35,199
we have

1653
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:40,600
developed uh are still

1654
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:40,600
satisfied so the liquid can exist

1655
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:45,040
there and of

1656
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:52,199
course

1657
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:54,639
uh it is a it is not completely stable

1658
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:57,880
so it's metast stable so if you to give

1659
01:28:54,639 --> 01:29:00,960
it a perturbance which is large enough

1660
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:04,800
it will collapse it will jump the the

1661
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:09,840
liquid will immediately flash into vapor

1662
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:15,239
uh or the vapor will condense uh

1663
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:15,239
explosively into uh into

1664
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:25,679
liquid and this flashing and uh and

1665
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,679
U oh

1666
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:32,960
um Senor moment I don't remember the

1667
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:36,000
name of uh the the collapse the it's a

1668
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:40,760
typical phenomenon

1669
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:44,719
that can cause the erosion of for

1670
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:47,000
example Blades of steam turbines

1671
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:51,000
cavitation

1672
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
thanks um all

1673
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:57,719
right because the vapor The Vapor goes

1674
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:00,440
to um to this region and then it

1675
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:03,679
immediately realizes that it has to

1676
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:07,320
condense and it does it in a in a in an

1677
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:11,159
Abrupt way and that creates uh that's a

1678
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:14,159
shock that's creates damage to the

1679
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:14,159
structure

1680
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:20,560
okay all right

1681
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:28,600
so yeah we still have uh

1682
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:33,480
few moments and uh maybe we can

1683
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:35,920
go uh ahead with the what we the subject

1684
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:39,080
that we left on the side but now we have

1685
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:43,480
to return we did the first part and

1686
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:46,520
today we'll do just a little bit more

1687
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:51,239
remember we were talking about exergy

1688
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:54,040
and this second LW efficiency we uh

1689
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:55,840
talked about cogeneration the last time

1690
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:57,960
and you told me that an it has

1691
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:02,320
cogeneration which make me very happy

1692
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:04,639
and uh uh and District uh and District

1693
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,639
uh

1694
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:14,320
heat okay so now that we have developed

1695
01:31:10,119 --> 01:31:15,280
U the simple system model and uh the

1696
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:20,840
bulk

1697
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:25,080
flow model for the exchange of

1698
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:26,440
mass we can ask uh the question if I

1699
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:30,080
have a certain

1700
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:32,760
flow at certain conditions well say

1701
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:35,040
pressure temperature and therefore

1702
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:38,800
enthalpy

1703
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:42,679
entropy and possibly also in this case I

1704
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:44,600
forget about uh gravitational potential

1705
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:49,000
and kinetic

1706
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:49,960
energy uh so we we ask ourselves what is

1707
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:55,960
the

1708
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:57,400
maximum work that I can OB aain by using

1709
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:01,080
that

1710
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,080
flow in a given

1711
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:08,199
environment and here I use the

1712
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:11,239
environment in two

1713
01:32:08,199 --> 01:32:14,360
ways the first way is that I want my

1714
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:16,360
Machinery to process the flow without

1715
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:20,000
accumulating the material

1716
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:22,719
so the mass that goes in must also go

1717
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,719
out and must be uh given to the

1718
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,719
environment

1719
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:32,239
and I will give it to the environment at

1720
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:37,880
conditions

1721
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:40,679
where I have extracted as much as I

1722
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:42,040
could so when it is mutual equum with

1723
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:44,520
the environment

1724
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:46,280
essentially at least from the thermal

1725
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:50,679
point of

1726
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:53,360
view and typically also the pressure

1727
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:58,520
point of view so the environment here uh

1728
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:58,520
provides it's also uh ambient

1729
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:06,760
pressure and the other way is that I

1730
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:12,000
need the environment as a damp for

1731
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:15,760
damping the entropy because if I have to

1732
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:18,960
change the state of my flow from one to

1733
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:21,600
this ambient to environmental

1734
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,920
conditions most likely it will have to

1735
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:28,360
change entropy from S1 to

1736
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:32,239
SAA and that change of

1737
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:34,760
entropy suppose it's a reduction in

1738
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:36,679
entropy it means that I have to extract

1739
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:39,400
entropy from the

1740
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:41,480
flow that's the purpose of the

1741
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:43,000
machinery and of course the Machinery

1742
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,480
will have to give it somewhere because

1743
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,679
the Machinery operates cycle cannot

1744
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:50,679
accumulate entropy

1745
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:54,159
so the

1746
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:57,199
um the environment is there to accept

1747
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:59,119
the and at least the entropy that I must

1748
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:02,679
extract from the flow in order to

1749
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:05,560
exploit it but uh it may also be there

1750
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:08,440
to dump also the entropy that may be

1751
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:10,960
produced by irreversibility uh by the

1752
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:13,159
Machinery but if we are asking for the

1753
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,560
maximum we can do we suppose the

1754
01:34:13,159 --> 01:34:18,400
machiner is reversible so at least that

1755
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:22,440
contribution of the entropy produced by

1756
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:25,040
is not there and uh so this is the

1757
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:26,639
setup as as usual you solve the problem

1758
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:29,080
by making an energy balance and an

1759
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:29,080
entropy

1760
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:34,360
balance and setting the entropy produced

1761
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:37,760
by reversibility equal to

1762
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,760
zero this is the

1763
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,679
result so the maximum work is the linear

1764
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:44,119
combination of changing enthalpy and

1765
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:46,520
changing

1766
01:34:44,119 --> 01:34:47,639
entropy represented here this is called

1767
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:51,560
the

1768
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:54,320
exergen of the flow of that bu Flow

1769
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:55,679
State with respect to enir

1770
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:59,600
temperature

1771
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:01,159
ta and with Outlet conditions that are

1772
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,480
ambient

1773
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:07,639
conditions they noted

1774
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,639
by of

1775
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:14,000
course

1776
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:16,520
uh I may also have the opposite problem

1777
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,360
this is exactly the same situation

1778
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:23,239
simply that now I don't want to exploit

1779
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:25,639
a certain Val Pro State one but I want

1780
01:35:23,239 --> 01:35:28,840
to produce use B FL state which is at

1781
01:35:25,639 --> 01:35:30,960
conditions different from

1782
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:33,239
uh neutal equilibrium with the

1783
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:36,119
environment for example this is material

1784
01:35:33,239 --> 01:35:38,719
processing I want to uh or maybe I want

1785
01:35:36,119 --> 01:35:42,159
to heat up some

1786
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:44,560
water what is the

1787
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:46,280
minimum work that is needed by this

1788
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,159
Machinery to do

1789
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:51,520
it well

1790
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:53,920
again we use the environment in two ways

1791
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:56,360
we we we take the material from on the

1792
01:35:53,920 --> 01:36:00,400
environment for example we go to a mine

1793
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:05,719
for raw materials or we go to a lake or

1794
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:05,719
Reservoir the water res for fresh

1795
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:11,880
water and we also use the environment as

1796
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,800
a provider of the entropy that may need

1797
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:18,280
be needed needed in order to achieve

1798
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:20,560
that task because if uh The Bu flow

1799
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:24,280
conditions one have more entropy than

1800
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:27,960
ambient conditions then I need to um

1801
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:30,760
give entropy to this flow and that

1802
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,239
entropy the best way to do it is not to

1803
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:36,400
generate it by

1804
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:38,800
reversibility but that is to uh Pro get

1805
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:43,239
it from the environment for example when

1806
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:47,760
we hit up water from 20° to say

1807
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:50,159
60° um I mean uh

1808
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,040
Celsius

1809
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:55,440
um yes we could also do it without

1810
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:57,880
environment we just could use an

1811
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,360
electric boiler the electric boiler

1812
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:03,639
would use some

1813
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:05,719
work dissipated by jeel effect so as to

1814
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:09,800
generate the

1815
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:14,080
entropy necessary to heat up the

1816
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:16,840
water okay not use doesn't use the

1817
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:20,840
environment whereas this reversible

1818
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:24,600
situation is like a heat pump setup in

1819
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:26,320
which I do uh

1820
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,159
take the entropy from the environment

1821
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:31,960
and the environment gives me that

1822
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:36,480
entropy only if I take only also some

1823
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:39,239
energy and that energy gets pumped to my

1824
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:42,920
my fluid and that fluid will will

1825
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:45,400
receive exactly the entropy and the

1826
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:46,320
energy needed in order to go from here

1827
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:49,760
to

1828
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:52,760
there this is again the same exergy as

1829
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,760
before

1830
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:01,400
okay we uh I think time is up isn't it

1831
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:04,400
so we'll take it from uh from here next

1832
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,400
time
