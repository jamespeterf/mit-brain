1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
I'm Emily. I'm the founding product

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,200
engineer at Nowadays and we're a team of

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,960
MIT engineers at a Wongwide Combinator

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
building the first AI co-pilot for

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,960
streaming corporate events.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,880
So, I studied computer science and

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,720
design at MIT where I led large-scale

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,439
initiatives from running the institute's

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,199
1,500 person career fair to organizing

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,199
fine dining pop-ups that served hundreds

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
of students. Coordinating the logistics

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
down to each minute taught me firsthand

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,439
just how complex event planning can be

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
and how much better it could be with the

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,480
right tools. Nowadays was founded by Amy

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,800
and Anna sisters who both led events at

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,960
Google, Facebook and MIT before starting

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,719
the company. I joined early to help them

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,719
build the product translating these real

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,200
world pains into AI powered solutions.

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
Every organization here runs events.

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,960
Whether that's leadership offsite, sales

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
kickoffs, global conferences, or company

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
retreats. With an increasingly

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,719
distributed workforces around the world,

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
organizations rely more than ever on

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
these gatherings to retain talent and

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
strengthen their company culture. The

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,440
demand for in-person connection is

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,840
clear. But the way events are planned

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,680
hasn't caught up. For the first time, AI

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,240
can meaningfully automate these tedious

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,439
tasks that are manual for event planning

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,840
and make the process scalable.

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,920
Behind every off-site or conference is a

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
surprisingly manual process. Planners

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,520
actually spend weeks juggling emails,

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
hundreds of hours creating spreadsheets,

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,520
and phone calls with hotels while

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
pricing remains really opaque. Current

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,680
legacy tools like CVET dominate the

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,360
space, but they're clunky, require

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,280
training, and don't address the last

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
mile, actually sourcing venues,

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,680
negotiating, and making decisions.

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
nowadays solves this by using AI to

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,840
contact venues, negotiate rates, and

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
deliver a dashboards of results within

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,159
24 hours, allowing teams to make faster,

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,000
smarter, and more cost-effective

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,680
decisions.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,680
Nowadays, powers the entire event

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,759
workflow end to end. Our system will

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,560
pull live flight data to recommend the

55
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,719
best cities for distributed teams.

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
It reads, understands, and filters venue

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
options automatically, so you don't need

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
to look through thousands. With one

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,840
click, our AI sends requests to the

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
right hotels.

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,239
Within 24 hours, a dashboard updates

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
with live proposals.

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,760
Nowadays, gives companies a holistic

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
view to minimize spend and maximize

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,520
their options, not just for venues, but

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,800
also for restaurants, activities,

67
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,400
attendee management, and transportation.

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
One of our strongest signals of traction

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,160
has been referrals. Yan, a director at

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
Google, used nowadays for an incentive

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,920
trip. He loved the experience and

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
referred us to other EAS. And within a

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
week, four of his peers at Google also

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,400
became paying customers.

75
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
We've also powered events like Amazon's

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,560
executive dinners in New York and

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,040
Google's 375 person offsite at Universal

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,440
Studios. Customers consistently say

79
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,519
nowadays negotiates better rates than we

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,360
can ourselves. Some have gone even

81
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,239
further. Four of our customers became

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,000
investors after using our platform.

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
In the last two years, we've planned

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
over $11 million in event spend across

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
300 events for startups and enterprises

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
alike. Our business model is

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,640
straightforward. An annual subscription

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,800
or a percentage sourcing fee plus hotel

89
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,800
commissions. We're also an IATA

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,319
certified travel agency which allows us

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
to guarantee the best group rates

92
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,080
globally.

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,280
Corporate events are an excellent market

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,280
because customers have a high

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,480
willingness to pay and very little

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
churn. Cvent's recent $4.6 6 billion

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,560
acquisition demonstrates the size and

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
value of the market. Our advantage is a

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,040
combination of an international database

100
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,280
of over 400k venues and an AI first

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,040
model. This allows us to build faster,

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
cheaper, and more scalably than any

103
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,879
competitor out there.

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,560
We're looking for corporate partners

105
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,879
globally who host recurring off sites

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,360
and conferences as well as travel agency

107
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,799
partners to white label our technology.

108
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,640
And if this is not part of your

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
day-to-day role, we'd love for you to

110
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
connect us with your executive

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,680
assistant, chief of staff, or travel and

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
events team. They'll thank you for it,

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,720
and you may finally get that company

114
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,239
offsite that's been in the works for

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,080
years.

116
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,480
I'm Emily, and we're nowadays, a

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,480
sister-ledd MIT's built startup at a Y

118
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,439
Combinator, making planning simple.

119
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,439
Thank you.
