00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,920
I'm Carara Miller. And I'm Rob Stoner.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,480
And from the MIT Energy Initiative, this

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,640
is What If It Works, a podcast looking

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,320
at the solutions for climate

[Music]

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,000
change. Today, we're going to examine

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,800
how the world's most populous country,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,519
India, is thinking about clean energy

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,640
and how policy shifts in the US might

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,880
affect their trajectory. But first, a

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,480
story about environmental degradation

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,840
versus well, cold hard cash and the

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,559
kinds of experiments you have to do to

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,800
understand how to alter human behavior.

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,440
One thing that development economists

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,160
think about a lot, but maybe not

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,800
everyone else does, is just how the

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,000
nature of market frictions might change

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,480
what the optimal policy is. That's

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
economist Namrathakala. She's an

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,920
associate professor in applied economics

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,159
at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
And a few years ago, she and some

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
colleagues decided to figure out how you

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,439
can best incentivize farmers to stop

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,479
setting fire to their fields at the end

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,200
of the season. Every year farmers in

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,159
North India and also other parts of Asia

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,560
burn their fields to clear it for the

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,280
next crop because that is the quickest

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,759
and cheapest way to prepare your field

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,159
before the next season. Except the air

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,159
quality implications of doing this are

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,720
very large and very negative. And so

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,119
there's work in epidemiology that shows

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,400
that it's responsible for about 20% of

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,799
New Delhi's air pollution during the the

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,320
burning season. I don't need to tell you

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
but New Delhi air pollution levels

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,360
extremely high, most polluted capital

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,360
city in the world and so on. Experts

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,880
have estimated that burning this crop

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,240
residue causes more than 60,000 deaths a

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,799
year. So the incentive was high for Kala

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,840
and her colleagues to figure out how do

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
you convince farmers not to do this? A

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
reasonable answer might be, well, check

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
their fields at the end of the season

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
and if they haven't burnt them, give

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,599
them some money. And what we found is

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,319
that because of market frictions like

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,959
liquidity and trust, that actually

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,200
performs extremely poorly. In fact, that

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,120
leads to no additional emissions

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,920
reductions relative to not paying

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
farmers at all. So, just to underscore

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,239
that, researchers say, "I'll give you

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,640
money at the end of the season for not

60
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,280
burning your fields." And it doesn't

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,680
move the needle. People go ahead, they

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,200
burn them anyway, regardless of the fact

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,959
that they have a contract to get paid.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,360
What instead works is paying farmers the

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,879
same amount of money but giving them a

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,720
small amount 25% upfront before the

67
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,239
season as a sign of trust and to

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,800
decrease their liquidity issues. And

69
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,599
that doubles compliance relative to the

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,760
control group and in fact it performs

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,480
much better than doubling the total

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,959
payment that you give them. Right? And

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,760
so this is sort of just one example

74
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,400
where understanding market conditions

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,000
allows you to design an effective policy

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
that then achieves these emissions

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
reductions at a lower cost relative to

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,640
kind of this higher more expensive less

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,920
effective contract. So in essence the

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,440
bottom line was not the bottom line.

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
increasing the payment didn't work. But

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,840
understanding that these were not

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,120
wealthy people and having some money

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,720
upfront mattered well that turned out to

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
be crucial to convincing them you were

86
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,799
serious. We tested a payment that said

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,440
800 rupees per acre everything paid at

88
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,319
the end 800 rupees per acre 200 now 600

89
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,080
later if you comply. And then we tested

90
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,159
a version that said 1,600 like double

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,519
the amount but all at the end of the

92
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,519
season and the 25% upfront is where we

93
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,280
see all the compliance or the 50% up

94
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,000
front the upfront contracts are where we

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,159
see all the compliance happening. Kala

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,120
says that India is moving towards clean

97
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,479
energy quickly but in a place where many

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
people are trying to make sure they've

99
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,919
got enough to eat every day there has to

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,720
be a balance between economics and the

101
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,440
environment. And so like a lot of the

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,919
developing world in the 90s and 2000s

103
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,240
thanks in part to uh trade reforms and

104
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,880
other types of reforms extreme poverty

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,919
fell and worldwide I think the number is

106
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,040
about 2 billion people escape poverty

107
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,759
and in India as well as I mentioned that

108
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,680
said this has been reversing in the

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,000
developing world in about the last 10

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,919
years and so these tradeoffs of poverty

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
reduction combined with emissions

112
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,400
reductions I I think will continue to be

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,000
salient for developing countries uh

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,000
moving forward. Right? And just to kind

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
of put some numbers on this, the per

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,199
capita income in subsaharan Africa is

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,280
about $1,600

118
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:13,000
uh right in India it's something like

119
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,600
2500. Uh in the US it's like

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,840
$82,000. Kala says that people who

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,639
haven't visited India for five or 10

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,560
years tend to be shocked by the rapid

123
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,120
rate of change. Indeed, her own

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,960
childhood is reflective of that change.

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,800
When I was younger, my family did not

126
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,680
have an air conditioner, and that was a

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,919
source of kind of great joy and comfort

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
when that arrived. And I was about, I

129
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,759
think, maybe 7 years old, and there was

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,400
one. And so, you know, everyone sort of

131
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,880
crowded in to to sleep at night in the

132
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,520
in the same room. And then there was a a

133
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,160
lot of kind of managing uh because it

134
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,680
was a big energy consumer and we wanted

135
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
to manage the bills. There was a lot of

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,400
like it's been on for an hour now shut

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
it off, right? And there was also a lot

138
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
of uh which is I think emblematic of a

139
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,639
lot of experiences dealing with outages

140
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,680
and trying to protect your appliances

141
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,840
from these uh outages that might hurt it

142
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,919
and the inability to use all your

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,240
appliances uh that you wanted all the

144
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,479
time especially because when it's hotter

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,080
you know is correlated with with demand

146
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,039
and also outages. So I think personally

147
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,199
a lot of what I see in the data and what

148
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,919
I do in the fieldwork resonates with

149
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,680
just like my experience growing up. But

150
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,880
India has been ramping up the

151
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,240
reliability of its grid which has made a

152
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,280
huge difference and so I think there's

153
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,960
been a massive electrification program

154
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,080
over the last couple of decades and I

155
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,680
think hundreds of millions of people

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
have benefited from that. I think

157
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
there's been a large increase in

158
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,280
appliance use and I think it's kind of

159
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,400
just sort of correlated with with my

160
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,960
experience that in a country of you know

161
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,199
1.3 billion people when you go from 65%

162
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,199
electrified to almost 100% that's just

163
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,560
order of a magnitude increase in in

164
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,120
comfort and welfare. Meanwhile, India

165
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,599
has also embraced clean energy. Kala

166
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,080
says and that doesn't seem likely to

167
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:13,120
change even as American policy on energy

168
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,160
shifts dramatically. A lot of Indian

169
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,960
policy on regarding clean energy I think

170
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,919
and Chinese as well has been in my

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,560
opinion quite pragmatic and innovative.

172
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,360
Right? So if you look at cost reductions

173
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,280
around solar energy, India is such a

174
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,199
large market. It really is right. It's

175
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,560
the fourth largest wind market in the

176
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:39,120
world and renewable capacity just last

177
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,360
year grew by about 35% in India and I

178
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,919
think in in China solar capacity grew by

179
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,440
over 40% uh last year. So these markets

180
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,160
are large and they are growing fast and

181
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,800
India has electrified I think almost all

182
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,800
of its uh railway network which is a

183
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,879
system that carries 20 million people

184
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,000
every day. So these are like large

185
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
system and I think a lot of it has been

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,160
based in terms of whether it makes sense

187
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,240
of the economics along with you know

188
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,759
does it make sense in terms of uh the

189
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
emissions. So the railways running on

190
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,599
say diesel are are costly and and

191
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,759
variable in terms of cost.

192
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,000
Electrification can can be more reliable

193
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,039
if it's done well. So I think that's

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,280
sort of the this combination of what I

195
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,440
consider pragmatic and innovative has

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,879
been one kind of the first principal

197
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,720
component as I would call it of uh a lot

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,919
of these energy policy decisions that

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,519
that I've been aware of. So you made a

200
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,560
really interesting point there about

201
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,599
about the railroads and the

202
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,919
electrification displacing the use of

203
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,800
diesel. You know, I I think of India has

204
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,839
been sort of emblematic of of many

205
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,000
developing countries in that fuels are

206
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,279
very expensive there. That's right. You

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
may not experience that because

208
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,920
sometimes they're subsidized by the

209
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
government to sort of provide a buffer

210
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,640
in the middle. But India doesn't have

211
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,040
large primary energy supplies apart from

212
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,120
coal. They don't use coal on the

213
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,720
railways anymore. And and what that

214
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
means is that that renewables have an

215
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,519
advantage there because you've got to

216
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,519
import natural gas. And unlike us who

217
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,959
pay $3 per million BTUs, Indians pay 12

218
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,279
to$14 per million BT use, three or four

219
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,800
times the cost. And so suddenly solar

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,120
starts looking pretty good in India and

221
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,440
with pretty good sun that's really a

222
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,320
help and I think that's helping to sort

223
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,839
of propel this rapid adoption of of

224
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,440
lowcarbon energy. Not because it's low

225
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,839
carbon energy, because it's the best

226
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,480
deal. Yes, I think that that's going to

227
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,120
be, as I said, like just given the the

228
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,000
really salient trade-offs about growth

229
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,200
and poverty reduction. Uh most clean

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,600
energy policies will likely be driven by

231
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,880
economics. Let me go back for one

232
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,640
second, Namra, to this. in some sense if

233
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,600
you have a lot of poor people the

234
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,040
question of can people eat next week

235
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
maybe I don't want to put words in your

236
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,920
mouth maybe tends to subsume the

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,480
question of like are the glaciers

238
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,080
melting right and so people go to the

239
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,000
pools in India so the issue of energy um

240
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,240
even the issue of climate change is it

241
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,200
something people care about or are they

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,519
kind of like focused on other things I

243
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,000
think you know like everywhere in the

244
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,839
world I think the economy matters a lot

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,760
and jobs matter a lot. I have in the

246
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,079
most recent elections there has been

247
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,880
mention of air quality and I think

248
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,720
that's important. I think energy is

249
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,279
really important and I think electricity

250
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,959
and quality of life are very important

251
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,560
for sure and I think people value that

252
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,200
and I think people would reward that

253
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,959
electorally and uh so on. Is there an

254
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
explicit trade-off that you think of? I

255
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,839
mean, you know, how much of an increase

256
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,079
in emissions can India accommodate in

257
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,040
order to deal with poverty? How do you

258
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,320
think about that? So, I you know, I'm

259
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,640
very much like uh like smart policy

260
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,839
matters and by that, you know, by that I

261
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,560
mean one of my favorite papers that I

262
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,600
read in the last year was this paper in

263
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,680
science. The lead author was at the Potm

264
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,399
Institute and essentially what that

265
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,480
paper does is it takes 1500 policies,

266
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,320
climate policies that have been

267
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,160
implemented across the world and uses

268
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,279
really datadriven methods to find out

269
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,079
which ones were effective, right? And so

270
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,000
in some sense this is not a binary

271
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,959
version of should any country, you know,

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,360
India included have climate policy or

273
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,440
energy policy or not. It's so much more

274
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,920
a question of like what is the right

275
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,800
policy that has productivity co-

276
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,560
benefits and emissions reductions and

277
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,079
they find successful examples and they

278
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,480
show you right so in the developing

279
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,600
world the pricing policies matter a lot

280
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,440
more they have like examples of these uh

281
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,040
etc you can do the same thing with cost

282
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,279
benefit right and so I think that the

283
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,040
way that I think about the like is there

284
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,480
an emissions gap or is there like that

285
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,880
that we need to achieve our growth

286
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,560
targets I think thinking about these

287
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,560
kinds of policies is much more high

288
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,959
return because it's more like when

289
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,920
you're in it's not that I want to invest

290
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,040
in a tech firm yes or no it's like which

291
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,360
tech firm am I going to invest in is

292
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,440
really important for my returns and I

293
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
don't think policy is any different so I

294
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,959
think that's kind of thing one which is

295
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,079
why as I said I've been very heartened

296
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:32,399
by these large growths of an already

297
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,959
large renewable market that don't show

298
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,959
signs of slowing down and partly again

299
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,519
it's the economics partly it's the

300
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,200
demand but partly it's also the learning

301
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,560
by doing. So there's work that shows

302
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,720
that both in solar and in wind the more

303
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,480
you produce the more your average costs

304
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,800
go down and you can have policies that

305
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,760
induce lower costs over time by having

306
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,440
like R&D uh subsidies or or output

307
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,920
subsidies. So there's like really nice

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,959
paper by Robin Burgess and co-authors on

309
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,040
China solar experience. There's work by

310
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,040
Rich Sweeney at Boston College on

311
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,040
learning by doing in the wind industry.

312
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,560
So I think like these are all things

313
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,720
that make me think that you know there's

314
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,440
momentum in terms of the economics. I

315
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,079
think there's a portfolio of policies

316
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,519
many of which are not a trade-off some

317
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,839
of which might be a trade-off and we

318
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,160
should think about and so on. It's a

319
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
little bit from a US perspective, but I

320
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,120
wonder there's been an argument, there's

321
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,399
long been an argument here, that there's

322
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,240
really no point doing a big energy

323
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,560
transition in a place like the US if

324
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,360
much larger countries in terms of

325
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,360
numbers of people i.e. China and India,

326
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,399
you know, are going to keep their

327
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,600
appetite for energy is going to keep

328
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,920
increasing and and you could even make

329
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
it it's even more salient for small

330
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,839
countries like a a France or a Denmark

331
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600
or whatever. You can get pretty small

332
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
like what's the point in making these

333
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,079
little shaving things off here and there

334
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,639
if like China is building coal fired

335
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,800
power plants. I think there's kind of

336
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,320
like a particular amount of carbon that

337
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
you can put in the air and that's going

338
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,800
to increase the temperature by x degrees

339
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,800
and kind of increase the likelihood of

340
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,519
extreme events by a certain amount. So

341
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,040
when you scale that back, how do you

342
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,839
allocate the scale back? I think is a

343
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,399
good question, right? And I think that

344
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,160
there's

345
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:31,839
certainly merits to to saying something

346
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,320
like of course it won't matter if you

347
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,920
know I think the top 10 countries have

348
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,480
76% of carbon emissions right so if like

349
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,920
nine of them keep going maybe it will

350
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,959
matter less for sure at the same time I

351
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,560
don't think it's superfluous to consider

352
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,959
the fact that the US has like 29% of

353
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,920
cumulative historical emissions

354
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,920
you know India has 3%. So when you're

355
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,480
thinking about scale back, I think

356
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,639
that's potentially useful information

357
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,680
and does not at all in my opinion

358
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,160
preclude a reasonable solution, right?

359
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,959
And I think that if you just kind of

360
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,959
look at policy actions, the policy

361
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,040
actions are indicative of many

362
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,040
developing countries knowing that

363
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,480
there's benefits to investments in clean

364
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,320
energy, right? Like that's why now from

365
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
what I understand, China's emissions are

366
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,199
set to peak in 2030.

367
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,240
if they have this large renewable market

368
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,040
that's again growing like 45% relative

369
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,360
to last year for solar like I think

370
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,800
there's they're making gains in in

371
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,800
emissions reductions and so on. So for

372
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,160
me, you know, I think that's right.

373
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
There's a certain amount of carbon you

374
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
can put in the air that's going to

375
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,160
increase the degrees by a certain

376
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,920
amount. How should the scale back be

377
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,759
aortioned when, you know, they have

378
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,360
there's like the the poverty reduction

379
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,199
goals that I that I mentioned and the

380
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,800
per capita emissions are 14 tons per

381
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,880
capita for the US and two for for India.

382
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,959
And I think for subsaharan Africa, it's

383
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,720
probably less than half. That's not

384
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,160
superfluous information. I think that

385
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,320
really doesn't preclude a solution and I

386
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,240
think that the last couple of decades of

387
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,959
like renewable energy investment in fact

388
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,519
indicate to me that there is a feasible

389
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,440
solution at at hand

390
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,800
at least at a in an initial level. I

391
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,639
mean I think something that's lost in

392
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,839
the the climate discussion is often just

393
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,079
how much we have to do. I mean we really

394
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,519
have to massively reduce our emissions.

395
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,079
I mean was it somebody somebody uses the

396
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,279
the the phrase you know if if we each do

397
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:43,199
a little we all do a little if you add

398
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,800
it all up we have to do a lot and and

399
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,360
unfortunately India will have to be part

400
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,920
of that story. Absolutely. But I think

401
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
but that's why I think you know I I'm

402
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,519
heartened when I see these kinds of

403
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,000
year-on-year growth numbers from a large

404
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,560
market. And I think part of that again

405
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,079
like I think it's it has to be the

406
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,079
economics at play in to to some degree,

407
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,160
right? Like you have these I think the

408
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
the wind turbine paper that I was

409
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,880
mentioning earlier said something like

410
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,240
you manufacture twice the turbines and I

411
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,690
think your your costs fall by about

412
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,739
15%. It's pretty

413
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,739
[Music]

414
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,280
big. It sounds like you think people are

415
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,520
adopting these technologies because

416
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,080
they're cost-ffective like not is that

417
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,400
right? Not because they're clean.

418
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,160
I think it's both. But I think there

419
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,360
have been good concerted policy actions

420
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,520
from a lot of countries like the EU,

421
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,120
like China, like India to to mention

422
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,960
some and of course the US as well to

423
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,760
sort of understand that you're kind if

424
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,679
you're at a higher cost point, what does

425
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,640
policy need to do to make that

426
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,039
competitive and then do that, right? And

427
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,039
and so the a lot of the gains that we

428
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,080
are seeing are partly like the private

429
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,280
sector responding to policy certainty,

430
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,000
price signals, a large incoming market

431
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,760
and doing its part and getting us these

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
cost reductions that that make the

433
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,520
economics look better. Yeah, I think

434
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,960
it's pretty clear from what's happened

435
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,840
and the numbers that you know solar plus

436
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,000
batteries in India which are becoming

437
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,200
cheaper all the time actually

438
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,559
economically displace coal as coal

439
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,000
plants age. You know, you're not going

440
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,280
to rebuild those coal plants. You're

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,880
going to build solar and batteries

442
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,559
instead. That doesn't mean that the

443
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,160
whole power system can be replaced by

444
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,200
solar and batteries. But I think Indians

445
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,200
are being very realistic and pragmatic

446
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,520
about recognizing the opportunity to do

447
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,280
this and it's it's it's economically

448
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
driven but it's I think they're also

449
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,520
aware of the benefit that that has for

450
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,640
them as well. Absolutely. And Rob, no

451
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,039
concerns about intermittency and wanting

452
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,799
something that you can do 24/7 and the

453
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,200
sun doesn't shine all. I mean, does the

454
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,919
the batteries fully solve that problem?

455
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,600
No, they don't. Okay. No, they solve it.

456
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
You know, they saw that in when we're in

457
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,880
the regime at which we've got some of

458
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,280
the generating capacity from old coal

459
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
plants rolling off as those as those

460
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,360
plants age out. And you can replace

461
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,880
those with batteries and and wind to

462
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,679
some extent. But you're taking advantage

463
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,679
of other flexibility that still is

464
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
available within the generation system.

465
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,080
A lot of which comes from more modern

466
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,160
coal plants, but also from hydro, okay,

467
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,200
that um you know you can you can take

468
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,120
advantage of to deal with that

469
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,400
intermittency. But you get to a a

470
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,480
certain point where that's no longer

471
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
really feasible without adding a lot of

472
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,799
batteries and that starts to affect the

473
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,320
economics negatively. Now, of course,

474
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,840
we're hoping that we get cheaper and

475
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,000
cheaper storage technologies over time

476
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,640
and that that threshold just keeps on

477
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,039
moving up and and India can continue

478
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,640
down this path and you know they get an

479
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,480
economic benefit from it. Another way of

480
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,919
looking at that economic benefit is that

481
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,520
it's it's freedom from having to import

482
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,520
fuels in many situations that that um

483
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,360
would otherwise have to be used. So it's

484
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,520
it's win-win. India is really leading

485
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,679
the way in in showing how far you can

486
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,360
push a lot of these things. I think

487
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:17,360
Namroth I wonder what the impact if

488
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,960
there is any of the shift in US policy

489
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,679
has been on India. So, you know,

490
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,039
obviously very early in the Trump

491
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,679
administration, we saw the president

492
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,919
dismiss the Paris climate accord and

493
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,159
obviously the the approach is super

494
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,960
different from what the Biden

495
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,880
administration had been. Does India sort

496
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,760
of like we have a different policy? We

497
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,960
just keep on going. I think the it's a

498
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,720
little early to say you're right. So I

499
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,760
think the one thing that that I will

500
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,760
point out is that these renewable

501
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,640
policies and these kinds of growth rates

502
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,880
had been happening even prior to the

503
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,919
Biden administration right so there is

504
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,000
some broad trend of countries deciding

505
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,799
that for economic reasons for other

506
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,559
reasons like this is this thing to do

507
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,840
what does it slow down the rate perhaps

508
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,159
because you know there's market

509
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,159
conditions that have shifted there might

510
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,000
be like less technological

511
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,360
conditions that are favorable etc. But I

512
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,919
don't know how much of that is going to

513
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,640
affect this kind of broader trend of of

514
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,039
increased investment and and growth.

515
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,840
This is getting uh veering into your

516
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,080
personal experience. But I wonder if you

517
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,200
also see the

518
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,520
possibility clearly there's a lot of

519
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,360
people in the US who are Indian who've

520
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,600
either come here for school or come here

521
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,559
after school very technically capable

522
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,480
people. I wonder if at all in your own

523
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,919
like in the trajectory of your own life

524
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,440
you've seen more of those people return

525
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,480
to India versus stay in the US

526
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,559
indefinitely. I I don't know I don't

527
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,360
know if

528
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:59,600
you see any like balance shifting there

529
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,000
because I know that can be a sign that

530
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
like there are very good opportunities

531
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,559
at home maybe I don't want to stay in

532
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,039
this other country. Yeah, I think it's a

533
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,679
bit difficult to say also because like I

534
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,600
you know sadly I know more economists

535
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:19,200
than I know other types of scientists

536
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:22,559
really you know it's like um I'm a nerd

537
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,880
I don't get out much and so a lot of my

538
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,559
kind of personal experience is like

539
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
seeing my friends and co-authors and

540
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,760
things kind of make these career

541
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,840
decisions but only in one field and I

542
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,120
know a little bit but much less than

543
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,240
about other fields India has had this

544
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,880
influx of private universities that have

545
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,360
tried to value cutting edge research and

546
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,440
I think that's kind of been a heartening

547
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:48,799
development in the last 10ish years or

548
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,520
so and so you do see more people kind of

549
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,840
get PhDs in the US and then and then go

550
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,520
back and do cutting edge research there

551
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,480
so there's been I think a little bit of

552
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,320
that pull factor relative to kind of

553
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,600
these other macro factors I can't really

554
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,480
say if it's a big deal you know the Tata

555
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,640
had a lot of Indian PhD students at MIT

556
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
who were working on a variety of

557
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
technologies that found their way back

558
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,880
to India and I we you know we got to I

559
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,039
think 10 of them became Indian faculty

560
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,720
members over a period of four or five

561
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,919
years. We stopped counting at one at

562
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,520
some point but you know a lot of Indian

563
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,840
really really highly trained Indian

564
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,679
scientists and engineers certainly were

565
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,440
returning through that program to India

566
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,200
and I think they're having a big impact.

567
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
Absolutely. And you know similarly as I

568
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,360
said in in economics I think there's a

569
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,440
lot of it's a field with a lot of uh

570
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,159
depth of talent and so there's been like

571
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,880
more dispersion across space as well.

572
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,760
Namatha when you think about clean

573
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,799
energy going forward in India I wonder

574
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,520
what sort of gives you the most hope and

575
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,880
what also gives you the most cause for

576
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,720
concern or what you feel like the

577
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,480
biggest hurdles are going to be you know

578
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,720
as I mentioned kind of the the trend

579
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,720
gives me a lot of hope. It's a large

580
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,640
market. I think a lot of the recent

581
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,919
policies have helped the growth of clean

582
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,280
energy. At the same time, I think

583
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,360
there's more that you could do to really

584
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,760
make sure that you're getting the the

585
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,640
maximal returns to these policies. So

586
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,720
that's thing one. Uh so Nick Ryan at Yel

587
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,159
has a very nice paper on counterparty

588
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,720
risk in the solar market in India. And

589
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,200
so trying to understand what market

590
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,440
frictions, what contracting frictions

591
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,440
you should mitigate to make sure that

592
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,600
when you put in a policy in place,

593
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,159
you're getting the most private entry,

594
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
the lowest cost entry, and you're

595
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,480
targeting the consumers that you want to

596
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,880
be targeting. I think be be great to

597
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,919
see. The other thing which is kind of a

598
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,320
broad point about industrial policy and

599
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:52,320
green industrial policy is no different

600
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,559
is some of this ends up being countries

601
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,480
competing for the same slice of the pie

602
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,240
rather than making the pie bigger.

603
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
Right? So it's like the same thing can

604
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,039
be produced in country X or country Y.

605
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,360
So country Y tries to get subsidies in

606
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,679
earlier and become lower cost faster

607
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,240
with the learning by doing. But then if

608
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,360
both countries start that then in terms

609
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,279
of like aggregate welfare you don't get

610
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,440
uh as much as you would if they

611
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,960
specialized. So I think for countries

612
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,000
broadly thinking more about comparative

613
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,760
advantage and then how to target the

614
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,919
resources best that you want to target

615
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,240
towards these clean energy goals would

616
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,640
be great to see like just broadly across

617
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,240
the board versus let's it sounds like a

618
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,480
race to the bottom with who has the

619
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,919
cheapest solar cell. That's right. If

620
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,000
we're if if we all have exactly the same

621
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,080
advantage in producing a commodity and

622
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,640
it's just a question of who gets there

623
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,360
first then you know starting together

624
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,799
and trying to race might not be optimal

625
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,720
for the world right but uh figuring out

626
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,880
what your comparative advantage is so to

627
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,039
Rob's examples about uh India's recent

628
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,520
advances in the solar industry is a is a

629
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,400
great example so really thinking about

630
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,480
targeting within the industry to like

631
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,960
those resources I think is likely to

632
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,559
yield the maximal cost benefit. Well, I

633
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
think this this discussion has had an

634
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,679
interesting academic character. You

635
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,279
know, we're talking to an economist

636
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,279
rather than an engineer. So, it's, you

637
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,840
know, thinking and it begs the question,

638
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,279
what's the role of universities in

639
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,400
helping countries like India to advance

640
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:27,039
faster? Is that something we want to

641
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,360
talk about? I mean, how much time do you

642
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,880
have? Yes. Yeah. I mean, how do we do

643
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,120
But I mean maybe if we could talk from

644
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,080
your personal experience of how you

645
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,600
engage with the Indian government or

646
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,400
Indian companies to help them find their

647
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,880
unique path. So I think collaborations

648
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,320
are pretty key have been pretty key at

649
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,600
least for me and that's like

650
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,520
collaborations with economists in India,

651
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,279
collaborations with firms, state

652
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,760
governments and so on and that's a lot

653
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,159
easier when you have these ongoing

654
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,080
research relationships and so so you

655
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,000
know here I really want to give a shout

656
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,880
out to JPAL which is a center housed at

657
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,799
MIT but has offices all over the world

658
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,240
where you have these these educated

659
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:16,000
researchoriented professionals that are

660
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,559
forming these relationships, conducting

661
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,480
research and facilitating a lot of this

662
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,039
uh research and disseminating it as

663
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,039
well. And I think that's been really

664
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,520
helpful as well. So what is the role of

665
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,760
universities? I think you know the way

666
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,760
that I think about it is we we need to

667
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,760
produce knowledge. we need to kind of

668
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,679
collaborate in the production of that

669
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,559
knowledge because at least in my field I

670
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,320
think it's better when it's done in

671
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,799
collaboration in knowledge of what the

672
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,279
context is how you improve things when

673
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,120
you understand what the frictions are

674
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:52,320
that's thing one and then I think two is

675
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,520
again helping figure out what policies

676
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,640
what firm strategies uh are the best out

677
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,480
of a portfolio of strategies and that's

678
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,880
difficult experimentation for a single

679
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,960
firm firm to do by itself. It's costly

680
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,760
or by you know for a single government

681
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,640
with uh maybe a year of lead time trying

682
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,880
to make a difference to do but having a

683
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,919
store of knowledge and having multiple

684
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,399
collaborations for people to learn is I

685
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,760
think a role for a university and I

686
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,720
think you know at least in my experience

687
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,640
MIT has done a lot of that. You you make

688
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,559
a really important point too. It makes

689
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,919
me think of like everything we have

690
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,240
talked about in this conversation has

691
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,720
been nobody lands in India and like

692
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,799
immediately knows who these farmers are,

693
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,960
who you're going to talk to to do right.

694
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,039
So you've got to like start to get to

695
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,360
know people and you have no ongoing

696
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,360
relationship that you know it's hard to

697
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,120
then get to the truth of what even would

698
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,960
work. Exactly. And then just figuring

699
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,480
out what the right thing to try is like

700
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,240
that's going to be like the steeper

701
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
learning curve and and all all of the

702
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,080
above. Yeah. We're also in a world in

703
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,760
which people are trying to move quickly

704
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,559
and and you know there are lots of

705
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,200
actors out there promoting their ideas.

706
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,720
They strongly believe in them or you

707
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
know maybe they have companies that sell

708
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
products that that align with those

709
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,320
ideas. You know people are saying well

710
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,240
you know solar is the answer or or green

711
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,960
hydrogen is the answer or LPG is the

712
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
answer and of course none of them is the

713
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,600
answer. there's there's a combination of

714
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,960
those things as an answer and it's very

715
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,440
contextual and it might not even be the

716
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,840
same in different parts of the same

717
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,080
country uh and it might change over time

718
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,080
and so I think universities also have a

719
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,640
role to play in in helping governments

720
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,919
to understand what's optimal and what

721
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
are the trade-offs that they have to

722
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,000
make in setting policy and and we've

723
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,679
seen that play out a number of places. I

724
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,120
spent a couple of days this week with a

725
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,760
bunch of oil and gas executives in uh in

726
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,640
Houston who wanted to get involved in

727
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,720
ending energy poverty and and I have not

728
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,320
the slightest doubt that they're earnest

729
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,440
in wanting to do that. Um and and you

730
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,679
know their perspective is well I think

731
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,399
people are overlooking fossil fuels as

732
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,360
part of the answer to ending poverty in

733
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,039
these countries and we're

734
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,640
overemphasizing

735
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,240
um climate as a as a a guiding light.

736
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,840
And you know I have some sympathy with

737
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,520
that.

738
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,520
Being poor is something that that people

739
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,760
experience right now and and ending it

740
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:27,520
is is uh important but that doesn't mean

741
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,240
the answer is natural gas or oil. It

742
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,960
just means that we need to be uh mindful

743
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,600
of the impacts outside the energy sector

744
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,440
on personal economy of people who live

745
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,440
in these places. Absolutely. And I think

746
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,600
that is the university like universities

747
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:47,960
can play that neutral research

748
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,960
datadriven role and and we should.

749
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,279
