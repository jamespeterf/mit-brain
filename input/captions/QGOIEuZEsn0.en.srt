7: Lessons from a Real Garage.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,840
Everyone loves the Innovation Origin

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,080
Stories that begin in garages or dorms.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
Hullet Packard's garage is so famous.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
It's an official historical site with a

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,080
plaque. So, let me advance that you do

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,080
not need a garage or garage culture.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,399
You'll see what I mean in a few minutes.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,520
Apple 2 has a garage origin story. It's

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,040
in the Steve Jobs biopic. In 1976, the

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,680
story goes, two Steves showed a

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,440
prototype to investors in a garage. They

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,200
had just sold 10 prototype motherboards

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
to a local store and they were ready to

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,039
make it a business. Some of the

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,440
investors later described the Steves as

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
smelly hippies. And one of the Steves

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
later explained that the garage was just

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,160
where they hung out because they had no

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,320
money for anything else. They did the

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,719
work elsewhere. This is such a great

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,879
origin story for what's become the most

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,960
valuable company ever that past this

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,799
point we're ready to believe whatever.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
Here is when I typically ask my audience

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,520
which may at different times include

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,080
investors, corporations or students to

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,400
guess how much money they would have put

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,119
in the project themselves had they been

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,799
able to see the prototype in the garage.

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,439
They end up telling me a number between

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,799
a,000 and $100,000.

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,560
I believe most of them respond

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,520
automatically with what they've heard.

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
Angel investors typically invest. When I

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,040
remind them that the story happened in

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,640
1976, they typically drop a zero.

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
So, let's see what the Steieves got in

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,280
1976 and how it compares with what we

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,200
think today the company needs to start

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
going. After a few conversations with

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,079
different people in their network, the

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,399
Steves met Mike Marcula. Marula had

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,159
retired from Intel, a multi-millionaire.

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,240
He was an engineer by training and had

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
worked as a marketing manager. So he

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,159
understood technology and understood

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,119
business development. So the story goes

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,799
like this. In 1976,

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,920
Mike Marcula saw the prototype the

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,520
Steves had assembled. He then invested

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,720
$92,000 of his own capital and secured a

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,200
$250,000 credit line for the business.

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
Together, the Steves and Marula went on

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,440
to raise more money, and they raised an

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,080
additional $1 million in the next 6

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,720
months. They built a company, chased

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
after revenue, and Apple computers is

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
the result.

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
You can get a fuller account of this

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
story from a variety of sources. What I

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,480
find interesting about it is that it is

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560
reproducible. What makes this story

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,800
interesting to me isn't that some of it

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
happened in a garage, but how Marcula

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
empowered the Steves and what he ended

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,280
up needing as proof before committing to

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,319
the project. Let me give you a sense of

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,360
perspective. The nearly $1.5 million

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,080
that Marula Jobs and Wnik raised in 1976

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,400
would have paid then for the salaries of

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,560
about 75 engineers. In 2024, it would

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,040
take about 20 million to afford that

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,280
many salaries in California. A

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,599
modern-day Marula would have to seed the

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,720
garage project with about $2 million

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,480
today to emulate what Mike Marula did in

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,879
1976.

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,360
And yet in 2024, the winner of your

81
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,599
average monthsl long pitch contest might

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,599
get at best $50,000.

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,599
That is the gap between how we've been

84
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,080
thinking about innovation lately and how

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,200
we used to think about innovation.

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,360
That is the mindset gap before us. Every

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,760
time I share this Apple origin story

88
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
with people, someone will come and tell

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,319
me that they don't know how to get $2

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
million from an investor and they'll ask

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,239
me whether it is realistic to expect

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
that amount. And my answer to them and

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,239
to you, if that's your question, is the

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,519
same. This happened. Maybe you should

95
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,959
actually make it your point not to

96
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
accept money from anybody that gives you

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,720
any less because what this story tells

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,959
you is how much money it takes to build

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,599
truly a company. And maybe you cannot do

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
it with just $50,000 at the time. It

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,720
takes a mindset shift to realize that

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,080
the investors you want are the ones that

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
are capable of that kind of an

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,799
investment and to be strong enough to

105
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
kind of move away from the investments

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,640
that are much smaller that might not get

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,200
you to actually demonstrate your great

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
idea. There's two sides to this story.

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,359
There's the first part of it in which

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
the Steves had managed to produce a new

111
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,120
kind of motherboard that no one had

112
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,600
produced before and had managed to sell

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,560
10 units of it to people in their

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,240
community. That required no investment.

115
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
It required no business plan. It

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,520
required no pitch. It required no

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
entrepreneurial contest. They were just

118
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
able to go and do it. Then there's the

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,560
second part of the story which is one in

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,440
which they realize they have a business

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,840
to build. Not a startup, a business. And

122
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,400
then they go out for investors. Then the

123
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,600
question is which kind of investor

124
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,680
should you choose? Or if you're an

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
investor, what kind of an entrepreneur

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,520
should you choose? Should you go with

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
someone that's ready to start with just

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,759
50k or should you hope to find an

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,040
investor that understands that the price

130
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,720
at the end is a company that's self-

131
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,240
sustaining.

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160
In that last case, you want to go with

133
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,080
an investor that's capable to put of

134
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
putting enough money from the beginning

135
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,320
so you can worry about the one thing

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,479
that matters. Build the business. You

137
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,160
can get started with what you have, but

138
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,400
you cannot demonstrate a multi-million

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,800
dollar business stringing ideas along

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,440
pennies at a time, much less build one.

141
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
You'll have to get real. And you'll have

142
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
to find people intent on getting real,

143
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,920
too. And that's true whether you are an

144
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:38,820
investor or the tinkerer with a garage.
