1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,880
in this video we'll look at a powerful

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,320
tool in the probabilistic method known

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,600
as bounded differences

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,760
inequality which also goes by the name

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
auma hofing

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,599
inequality this inequality tells us that

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,759
if we have a function of independent

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,320
random

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,280
variables and such that this function

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,239
doesn't change very much if we just

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,719
change one of the inputs of the function

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,360
then the output of this function given

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,480
the random input is fairly concentrated

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,199
around its

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,399
mean let's look at this actual statement

16
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,800
of this

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,480
theorem we have

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:00,079
X1 random variable taking values in the

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:04,720
set or in the probability space Omega 1

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,760
and so on so so X1 X2 to xn so these are

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,680
independent random variables and it's

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,200
very important that they're

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,600
independent we have a function f which

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,240
takes as input and coordinates and

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,520
outputs a real number and the hypothesis

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,400
of this theorem is that this function f

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,720
satisfies the following

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:33,240
property that if we look at two

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,720
different outputs of f on inputs X and Y

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,079
such that X and Y differ on exactly one

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,759
coordinate right so by only changing a

32
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,240
single coordinate of f the assumption is

33
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,520
that the value of f changes by no more

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,600
than

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:55,719
one right so F in some sense is fairly

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,479
smooth to the fluctuations in the input

37
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,439
if you change only one input coordinate

38
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,479
then the output of f does not change too

39
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,319
much does not change by more than

40
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,120
one okay what is the conclusion of the

41
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:15,560
theorem it says that the random variable

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,200
obtained by evaluating F on these

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,680
independent random input coordinates

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,440
right so we call this output Z this

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,480
random variable Z satisfies the

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,720
following concentration

47
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:33,280
inequality for every non- negative real

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:37,120
Lambda the probability that Z is exceeds

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,159
its expectation by at least Lambda is at

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,120
most this quantity here which goes down

51
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:47,959
rapidly as Lambda is gets

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,120
large and also we also have a lower tail

53
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,599
concentration

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,400
bound which says that the probability

55
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:59,080
that Z is significantly below its

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,400
expectation by more than Lambda at least

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,440
Lambda

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,440
is this probability is upper bounded by

59
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,120
the same quantity which again decays

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,519
extremely quickly when Lambda is large

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,720
okay so this is the statement of the

62
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,959
bound the differences

63
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,680
inequality again the intuition here is

64
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,959
that given independent inputs to a

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,239
function which satisfies this property

66
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,200
that it does not change by more than one

67
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,480
upon changing any single

68
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,000
coordinate the output random variable is

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,519
very concentrated around the

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,879
mean in the rest of this video I want to

71
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,640
present three applications of this

72
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,720
inequality the first application is

73
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,080
meant to illustrate a very simple

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,080
example of a function where we can apply

75
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,400
the theorem and this function is simply

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,599
the function

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,799
taking Boolean input so n Boolean inputs

78
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,920
outputs a real number obtained by simply

79
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,920
adding up the input

80
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,840
numbers another words this is a sum of N

81
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,360
different coin tosses each coin toss

82
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,239
resulting in zero or one and you can

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,680
check that this function has the

84
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,160
property that we require in this theorem

85
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,680
namely that if you flip just one of the

86
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,639
input coordinates the output changes by

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,240
well in this case exactly one but

88
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,400
certainly no more than one

89
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,039
now we can apply theuma hting inequality

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,520
or the Bounder differences inequality to

91
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,199
this function and that gets us a tail

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,000
bound

93
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,000
on the binomial

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:01,280
distribution this case you know that the

95
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,479
expectation of Z is exactly n /2 and it

96
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,479
tells you that the deviation cannot

97
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,320
exceed very much Beyond something on the

98
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,240
Square on the order of the square root

99
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,240
of uh the square root of

100
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,319
n

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:24,319
this bound is also known as the turnoff

102
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,319
bound

103
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,680
and in fact the proof of the bound

104
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,639
differences in equality is very Sim

105
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,039
similar to the proof of the turnoff

106
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,039
bound which you can view in a different

107
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,720
video let me now go on to the next

108
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,440
example the next

109
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,400
example concerned a problem called the

110
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,400
coupon collector

111
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:04,800
problem the setup is that we have

112
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,479
independent random numbers S1 through SN

113
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,160
and they're each chosen uniformly from

114
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,919
the numbers 1 through n so these numbers

115
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,880
are

116
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,880
uniformly and independently

117
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,039
chosen so you can imagine a setup as

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,199
having and different coupons and each

119
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:32,280
time you draw a random coupon see what

120
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,639
it is return it to the box and draw it

121
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,560
again and these S1 through SN are it's a

122
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,960
list of coupons that you draw from this

123
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,759
box and the random variable that we're

124
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,000
interested in Z is the number of missing

125
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,880
coupons the number of coupons that you

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,880
have not seen through this

127
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:01,000
process okay in other words this is the

128
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:07,120
number of elements of one through

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,240
n that are not among the elements S1

130
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,639
through

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,919
SN okay so this is a number of missing

132
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,319
coupons it is a random variable because

133
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,319
S1 through SN are

134
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,440
random we wish to understand how Z is

135
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,560
concentrated around its mean and for

136
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,000
that we can apply the bounded

137
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,879
differences in

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
equality note that this

139
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:38,759
function given viewing this quantity as

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,720
a function from S1 through SN as inputs

141
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,280
to the output number this function

142
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,680
satisfies the required hypothesis namely

143
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:52,080
if you change one of the SI you do not

144
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,120
change the number of missing coupons by

145
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,159
more than

146
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,520
one number of coupons missing coupons

147
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,800
might not change at all but it cannot

148
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,800
change by more than

149
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,520
one so this means that we can apply the

150
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,000
bound differences inequality to deduce

151
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:17,479
the conclusion that

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,520
the probability that Z deviates from its

153
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,360
expectation by more than Lambda is at

154
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,319
most two because here we're using upper

155
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:34,440
and lower bounds simultaneously time 2

156
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:34,440
to the minus E 2 Lambda 2 /

157
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,360
n

158
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,599
and the expectation is something that we

159
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,200
can calculate pretty easily using

160
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,800
linearity

161
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,480
expectations of these n different

162
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,080
numbers these n different

163
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,880
coupons each single coupon is missing

164
00:08:52,080 --> 00:09:00,000
with probability one minus 1 / n to the

165
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:04,480
N right because in this does this is the

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,480
probability that a specific

167
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,079
coupon coupon I is

168
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,399
missing which is the event that coupon I

169
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,360
is

170
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,800
not drawn in each of the N different

171
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,480
random draws and this quantity is very

172
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,000
close to n/

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,320
e okay so this is an application of

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,320
the bounded differences inequality to a

175
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,680
function which is not linear like before

176
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,160
right so the first example is a much

177
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,640
simpler example because the function f

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,680
is simply a sum of its inputs and here

179
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,959
there's a more complicated

180
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,160
function our last

181
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:57,120
example involves an even subtler

182
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:00,279
function and here the result is a

183
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,839
classic theorem in probabilistic

184
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:07,240
combinatorics due to Shamir and

185
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,240
Spencer from the

186
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,440
80s the theorem

187
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:23,000
concerns the chromatic number of a

188
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,000
random graph so let Z be the chromatic

189
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,920
number of

190
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,839
the

191
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,440
random graph

192
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,320
GNP okay so GMP is the airish r random

193
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,079
graph obtained by taking n vertices and

194
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,959
putting an edge between every pair of

195
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:53,079
vertices with probability P so throw a

196
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,639
probability P coin for each possible

197
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,399
Edge independently and construct a

198
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,399
random graph this way and then Z is the

199
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,000
chromatic number of of this random graph

200
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,120
right so it is the minimum number of

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,760
colors required to color all the

202
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,320
vertices so that no two adjacent

203
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,320
vertices receive the same

204
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,920
color this is some random variable and

205
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,880
this random variable is pretty

206
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,040
complicated it's pretty hard to

207
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,760
analyze but nevertheless using the bound

208
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,480
the differences inequality let us deduce

209
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,720
the following concentration bound

210
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,959
showing that Z

211
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,040
typically is not too far away from its

212
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,760
expectation and

213
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:45,399
specifically we have the bound saying

214
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,160
that Z deviates from expectation by more

215
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,160
than this quantity

216
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:56,680
here and this event has probability at

217
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,680
most 2 * eus 2 Lambda

218
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,880
s okay let's prove this

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,320
theorem the interesting part of this

220
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,000
proof is how to set up the function f so

221
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,320
that we can apply the bounded

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,639
differences

223
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,160
inequality so right now Z is some

224
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,680
quantity which seems kind of complicated

225
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,560
and it's based on Something That Is

226
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Random so how can we phrase it in terms

227
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,199
of independent random variables in a way

228
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,600
so that we can apply the bound

229
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:35,079
differences

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:39,040
inequality well one way to do it and um

231
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:44,800
it's a natural first attempt is to view

232
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:47,600
Z as a function with n choose two inputs

233
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,040
one input for each possible edge of the

234
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,040
random

235
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,720
graph that is a valid choice in the

236
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,079
sense that it satisfies the bounded

237
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,680
differences condition but it will not

238
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,720
give the correct bound

239
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,880
because it will turn out to have way too

240
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,720
many variables in this

241
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,560
function we'll take a look at a

242
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,199
different method that will be able to

243
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,560
provide us with the desired bound

244
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:17,639
and there's some neat idea here on how

245
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,199
to Cluster the random variables

246
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,760
together so we will represent our graph

247
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,199
on N

248
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,800
vertices

249
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:33,800
labeled 1 through n

250
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,399
and this graph which has some edges and

251
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:40,839
we'll need to represent these edges um

252
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,839
will represent them as an

253
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,360
element of the following product

254
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,160
set Omega 1 * Omega 2 so these are

255
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,720
cartisian products * Omega

256
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,680
3 so on to

257
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,120
Omega n minus

258
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,279
one and how we're going to encode the

259
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:20,680
graph using the element of of this

260
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,680
product set is as follows Omega 1 will

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,360
be the set0 comma 1 and this set will

262
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
record

263
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,320
the which either zero or one which one

264
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,160
gets chosen or record whether there's an

265
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,079
edge between the first vertex and the

266
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,839
second

267
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,560
vertex okay so

268
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,240
if we choose zero then there's no Edge

269
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,320
between one and two if we choose one

270
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,680
then there is an edge between one and

271
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,680
two Omega

272
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,680
2

273
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:05,079
is the

274
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:07,800
product set of 01 with itself and this

275
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:10,560
two bits

276
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,560
encodes whether there's an edge between

277
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,199
one and three and also whether there's

278
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,440
an edge between two and three that

279
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,440
information is encoded in

280
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,040
the element of Omega 2 that we

281
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,040
choose and Omega

282
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,519
3 is now 0a 1 raised to the 3

283
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,079
power and

284
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:43,120
here these three bits

285
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:46,279
record whether the three edges from 1

286
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,680
two and three to the fourth vertex are

287
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:53,040
included or not included in this graph

288
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,040
and so on

289
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,680
okay so every graph on N labelled

290
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:11,079
vertices can be represented as an

291
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:14,759
element of this product set and vice

292
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:18,040
versa basically we are clustering the

293
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:21,759
edges together according to the end

294
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,040
point of its uh the right end point of

295
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,399
its Edge according to this vertex order

296
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,399
of the vertices

297
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,759
okay so why is this

298
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,240
useful well if we have two graphs G and

299
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,240
G Prime that

300
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,319
differ

301
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,240
on

302
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:55,800
edges

303
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,800
around only one

304
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,720
vertex okay um

305
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,600
so if G and G Prime differ on edges

306
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,480
around only one

307
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:12,000
vertex

308
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,480
then the chromatic number so Kai of G

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,480
minus Kai of G

310
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,559
Prime this in absolute value is at most

311
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,319
one so if you have two

312
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,439
graphs and one can be obtained from the

313
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,400
other by modifying edges around a single

314
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,280
vertex then their chromatic numbers

315
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,840
cannot be differ cannot differ by more

316
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,760
than one and the reason is that well we

317
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,280
could have just chosen a new color for

318
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,080
the vertex that is

319
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,320
involved so we would not need to use

320
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,840
more than one color change to go from

321
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,559
one graph to

322
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,640
another okay so this is a important fact

323
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,000
that turns out to be incredibly

324
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,240
useful and it's useful because

325
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,480
if we have a graph represented as an

326
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,919
element of this product

327
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,000
set

328
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,880
then having another graph that's

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
obtained by just changing one

330
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,280
coordinate results in a graph where the

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,320
only changes to the graph itself are

332
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,360
edges around a single

333
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,400
vertex and

334
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:34,000
therefore the function

335
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,840
F that sends an element of this to an

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,360
element of the r basically the chromatic

337
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:44,159
number of the graph

338
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,159
satisfies the bounded differences

339
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:50,600
hypothesis and by applying the theorem

340
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,200
we can then deduce the concentration

341
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,720
bound here so that finishes the proof of

342
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,559
this theorem on the concentration of a

343
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,559
chromatic number of a random graph

344
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,240
all right so in this video we saw the

345
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,919
statement of the bound differences

346
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,640
inequality which is a important

347
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,679
versatile tool that is used all over

348
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,520
probabilistic

349
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,280
combinatorics it says that the

350
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,520
concentration of a function of

351
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,760
independent

352
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,640
inputs or this as long as the function

353
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,720
has the property that it doesn't change

354
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,480
very much if you only change a single

355
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,559
coordinate then the output as a random

356
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,159
variable is highly concentrated around

357
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,240
its mean and we saw three different

358
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,280
examples applying this Bounder

359
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,280
differences in equality
