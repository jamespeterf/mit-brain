00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,679
It is my honor and pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,080
our second keynote speaker, Jimmy

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:15,120
Olahir. Jimmy is an entrepreneur, an

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,440
adviser, an advocate for uh cickle cell

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,320
disease. He's also a father, um a

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
mountaineer who has climb climbed

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,480
Kilamanjaro. He also happens to be a

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,320
cast jevy recipient. Um, it was

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,720
participation in this groundbreaking

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,679
clinical trial that led to his staunch

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,840
interest in cell and gene therapies and

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,000
it has also led to a career in

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,640
advocating for accessibility to these

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,640
therapies regardless of your zip code.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
Um, Jimmy, we are so honored that you're

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
here to share your story with the broad

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,920
audience and welcome to the ladders to

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,920
cures community. Jimmy, everyone, thank

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,920
you.

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,800
Thank you for having me. Um, I don't

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,280
have slides, so this morning we're going

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,119
to have to rely on our imagination like

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
we did when we were kids. Can you guys

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,439
hear me? Is my mic on? All right, good.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,000
All right, so first I want to start with

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,400
my diagnosis story, how I was diagnosed

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,880
with uh cle cell disease. Um, as you can

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,000
tell, maybe not. My last name is of

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,000
Nigerian heritage. Um, back in 1985,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
um, when I was conceived, my mom didn't

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,200
have access to something as simple as

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,119
newborn screening. Um, I like to call

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
myself the most fortunate person with

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,240
cle cell disease. Um, fortunately for

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,680
me, my parents were able to fly to the

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,759
US, get that prenatal screening done. It

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
confirmed I would have cle cell disease.

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
Uh so they decided to give birth to me

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,759
here in the US which is probably one of

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,439
the reasons I'm standing in front of you

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,640
here

42
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,439
today because the type of cle cell

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,759
disease I had was SS. It was severe. Um

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,000
people with cle cell disease that I have

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,960
from where I'm from they die at the age

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,159
of five most likely after a stroke

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,719
because they don't know they have cle

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:10,879
cell disease. So to be here and you know

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,760
get that simple test in Washington DC um

50
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,560
really preserved my life. So we went

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,520
back to Nigeria. Um I grew up there as a

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,160
toddler and um I remember the first time

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,920
I actually knew personally when I had

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,760
cle cell disease was um I'm a big fan of

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,040
football. You guys call it soccer here.

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,879
I don't know why. you know, we're using

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
our foot to actually kick a ball and

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,760
football you're throwing with your

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,640
hands. So, that confuses me. Um, we can

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,360
go on all day about that. Uh, and I am

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,800
playing football with a group of friends

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,879
in school and I noticed every 20 five

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,480
minutes actually, I'm lying. Every five

64
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,879
minutes I had to stop, catch my breath,

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,000
ask for a drink of water and then I'll

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,720
go back in the game. Five minutes, same

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,959
thing again. Stop. Need water.

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,599
Breathing. Can't catch my breath. And it

69
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,200
got bad. I I became that proverbial kid

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,200
that you're standing at. People are

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,680
picking teammates. And I never got

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,400
picked. And I I was fed up with it. So I

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,920
went home that day and I called to my

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
mom. I'm like, "Mom, I don't understand

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,560
why I can't run like everyone else. I

76
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,319
can't play football. I need to drink

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,280
water. I need to stop. I need to catch

78
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,760
my breath." And as mothers do, she told

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,159
me I have this disease, but she laid it

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,000
out in such a simple fashion that she

81
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,400
actually unprepared me for the harshness

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,239
of the disease. Um because that's what

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
mother is. They want to protect us. So

84
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,360
like, you have this disease. It's not

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
bad. You're going to be fine.

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Everything's okay. Life is going to be

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,400
good. And um unfortunately, that's not

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,360
what happened. Um as I continue to get

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,680
older, that disease compounds on itself

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
is the way cell disease is. And I'm not

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,640
going to go into the mutation in a room

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
full of scientists. You probably know

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,280
more about it than I do um as to why

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
what it's already it's basically a

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
mutation um to protect you from malaria

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,480
if you live in those regions of the

97
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,239
worlds that um high have high prevalence

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,760
of

99
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,159
malaria

100
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,080
and it got worse. Um I I've been

101
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,320
fortunate to experience cle cell disease

102
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,639
in a low resource setting and in in the

103
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,040
west and I remember dealing with my

104
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,120
crisises which is the hallmark of the

105
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,600
disease is pain but it's not the only

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,199
disease it's not the only symptom of the

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,040
disease you know there are multiple uh

108
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,320
manifestations of the disease on your

109
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
body it's but the pain side of it um

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,080
growing up in Nigeria was extremely

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,320
difficult um I mean it's disable

112
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,880
anywhere I I didn't have access to the

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,280
things I eventually had access to here

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,080
in the west. Um, so I remember having

115
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,479
those pain crisises and all we had, you

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,960
know, to alleviate that was a

117
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,199
paracetamol and a menthol rub and my

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,759
parents would just go at it alternating

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,639
through all hours of the night massaging

120
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,360
my back until eventually the pain became

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,040
so torturous that I would pass out from

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
it, you you know, and I I remember

123
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,000
waking up the next morning. I don't know

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
if you guys remember that song,

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,360
Sunglasses and Advil. Last night was mad

126
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,400
real. That was my life growing up in

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,520
Nigeria. Um I was just in shock as to

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,680
the night we had just had as a family,

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,520
you know, with two sisters that were

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
sleeping, three sisters rather, and

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,919
didn't know what was going on in mom and

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,240
dad's room. how you know crazy and

133
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,199
visceral my both my parents were trying

134
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,680
to alleviate this pain that sometimes is

135
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,120
quite

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,160
indescribable. Uh and then you know at

137
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
some point they were like listen you're

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,960
born in the US why don't we have at

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,320
least you move there and see if this can

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,080
help um you know slow down the

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,160
progression of this disease or just make

142
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,160
it a little bit more bearable more to

143
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,520
manage. And so I I ended up moving back

144
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,440
to the US. I I live with my aunt and

145
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,199
I'll never forget my first uh I I got uh

146
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,960
connected to my hematologist. I was

147
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,919
living in New Jersey at the time. It was

148
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,479
Robert Wood Johnson and um we had like a

149
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,600
support group and the hematologist and

150
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,160
the whole support staff basically gave

151
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,319
me the layown of what happens here in

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,479
the US if I have a crisis like all right

153
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,199
so what's going to happen if you get

154
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,720
this pain just dial 911 you know

155
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,639
someone's going to come pick you up

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
we'll take you they'll bring you to the

157
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
ER and you know we'll work on you from

158
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,479
then and they even went to they even

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,080
went to into some other things that I've

160
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,600
been facing in Nigeria that I thought I

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
was crazy. I used to do this thing where

162
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,000
I would eat chalk after school. I would

163
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
run to the chalkboard and steal chalk

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
from the teachers thing, eat it. I'll

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,319
eat foam. I had like a couch in my house

166
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
that I had completely destroyed cuz I

167
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
was eating foam. And I thought I was a

168
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,479
kid that was just going crazy. And I

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,639
never expressed this to

170
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:57,199
anyone. And in this support group,

171
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,520
someone came up with that same issue. I

172
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,880
eat chalk. I eat foam. I find myself

173
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,639
eating toothpick. All these great

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
things. And the hematologist said it's

175
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,360
something called pah, you know, where

176
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,120
your body is severely lacking nutrients

177
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
that you are pushed to start eating

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
weird things to make up for that lack of

179
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
nutrients. And I was just like, oh my

180
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,319
god. You know, when I lived in Nigeria,

181
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,160
I thought I was crazy. And here in the

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
US, turns out that is actually a

183
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,080
diagnosed disease. So, you know, I was

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
happy to be here that, hey, listen, you

185
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
know, this is going to help. The fact

186
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,680
that we've solved one issue that I

187
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
thought I was just mental that is

188
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
actually a thing, a side effect of cle

189
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,680
cell disease.

190
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,800
So, fast forward to my first crisis in

191
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
the US. Um, I was in the basement. Um,

192
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,880
basically lived like Harry Potter, but

193
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,880
that's another story. Um, I was in the

194
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,280
my basement room and I I called 911 and

195
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,599
um 7 minutes, 10 minutes tops, they were

196
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,160
down there. Um, I was in the back of an

197
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,000
emergency room and before you knew it, I

198
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
was, you know, looking at the bright

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,199
lights of an emergency room and a doctor

200
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,199
came in and infused me with like

201
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:04,039
morphine. And 5 minutes later, I was in

202
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:10,080
no pain whatsoever. And I was just in

203
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:12,160
shock as to how different these two

204
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,039
health care systems are. Um, just

205
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,440
because of where I'm born, the simple

206
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,479
things that have made my life easier, at

207
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,280
least I thought so far compared to where

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,440
I come from. And you know, I felt better

209
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,319
at the time and I thought my disease

210
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,479
would be controlled. Um, but cle cell is

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,240
quite resilient and it gets worse as you

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,640
get older. You have school, you have

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
different stressors and for me that

214
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,760
exactly happened. I was living in New

215
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,839
Jersey at the time. The weather was

216
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,479
cold. So that compounded to the disease

217
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,200
and everything um went pear-shaped.

218
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,200
Everything started to fall apart. Uh I

219
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
couldn't finish school. Every semester I

220
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,720
had to withdraw. Uh I would get sick

221
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,560
constantly non-stop. I I lived um they

222
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
had a bed reserved for me in the

223
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,120
hospital. That's how bad it was.

224
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,440
uh and you know everything came to a

225
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,760
head for me when I had gone through a uh

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,200
many times I'd come close to losing my

227
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,160
life but this particular one um it was a

228
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
simple porticath

229
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,160
insertion and what's standard of care

230
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,720
with cle cell disease is when you have a

231
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
surgery no matter how minor you need a

232
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
blood transfusion because you're going

233
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,320
to lose blood your blood counts are

234
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,120
going to drop um but the surgeon he and

235
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,760
I had he and my wife I should say not me

236
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
I was I I never advocated for myself and

237
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,839
you know that's one of the things I'm

238
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,440
lucky for. I had very good advocates in

239
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,360
my life partner and my parents but we

240
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,600
were advocating for this blood

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
transfusion and he was he got so upset.

242
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
He's like you don't tell me how to run

243
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,279
my O. I'm putting this port in and

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,920
you're going home. So we're like all

245
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,600
right. So we do the port and on my way

246
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,480
it was you know outpatient surgery. On

247
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,880
my way home, I suffered a cardiac arrest

248
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,959
and my wife actually had to pull over on

249
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,200
the side of the road and they another

250
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,920
emergency uh ambulance came and they

251
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,600
took me back this time to a different

252
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,279
hospital where um I was in there for

253
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,279
probably about in the ICU for about 2

254
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,440
weeks and and you know that's where

255
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,480
things really got bad and I I realized

256
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,480
probably there's no surviving this

257
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,519
disease. Um, you know, my mental health

258
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,279
had really gone down the drain and I had

259
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,120
basically giving up. Uh, you know, I had

260
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,959
no interest in wanting to be alive. I

261
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,320
remember actually I had like a bad blood

262
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,839
transfusion once and um I I I had a coma

263
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,760
uh for 24 hours from that blood

264
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,000
transfusion and I when I woke up I was

265
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,279
so disappointed that I woke up that I

266
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,519
was that's how bad my life my mental

267
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,519
health everything had gone that I I was

268
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:49,440
upset from waking up from a coma. Um so

269
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,160
a after that um tragic uh crisis uh my

270
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,720
parents were really worried um obviously

271
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,120
and they started pushing that I go for a

272
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
bone marrow transplant and I have three

273
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
sisters so my my three sisters they were

274
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,920
living in the UK at the time they they

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,600
came over and we did a be a match test

276
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,959
making sure like I have three sisters

277
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,760
one of them is definitely going to be a

278
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,720
match and as sisters do they disappoint

279
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,760
you all of them none of them were a

280
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,399
match

281
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,480
I I still love them. Uh which at the

282
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
time was quite disappointing but you

283
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
know in hindsight turned out to be a

284
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
good thing because that was one of the

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,320
eligibility criteria for a gene therapy

286
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,240
clinical

287
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,760
trial. Uh but at the time still I I

288
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,279
really wasn't really interested in doing

289
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,440
anything. I was just done with living if

290
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm honest and but as parents still like

291
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,360
I said they kept on pushing pushing

292
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,720
pushing and you know I was quite tired

293
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,000
of it. you know, I'm like, you know, I'm

294
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,920
going to do this research just to get

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,800
you off my back, you know, in an attempt

296
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,040
to pacify you. I'm going to research I

297
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,360
think I've cle cell disease is a genetic

298
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,800
disease and I've seen these things. I

299
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,839
I'm not sure what it is, but I've heard

300
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,399
of something called gene therapy. Maybe

301
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,399
20, 30 years from now, if I'm still

302
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,240
here, this can potentially help and you

303
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,600
know, you guys can leave me alone. So, I

304
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,079
had done this research and I I did a

305
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,320
simple Google alert and that was it. if

306
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,040
anything comes up with cle cell disease

307
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,839
and gene therapy in the content, I'll

308
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,519
get that alert in my inbox. And I had

309
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,800
done that research and six months after

310
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,440
I had done that research, I got an NPR

311
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,000
article in my inbox about a woman named

312
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,160
Victoria Gray who was the first person

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,639
to go through a crisper-based gene

314
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,800
therapy um to alleviate the symptoms of

315
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,200
her cle cell disease. I can't say cure

316
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,200
cuz people get upset. We're not sure

317
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,440
yeah if it's a cure. So I use alleviate

318
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,839
instead. Um and

319
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,160
um at the end of that article they had

320
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,320
the contact information of the principal

321
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,079
investigator for that clinical trial.

322
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,480
This was in 2019. Uh so I reached out

323
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:57,600
and the next day to my shock he reached

324
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,920
back out. Um which was quite special

325
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
because with cle cell disease it it

326
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,519
almost felt like I like to call it the

327
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
back of the bus disease. you're never

328
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,160
really number one. Um, no one really

329
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,720
cares. Um, which is not the case now.

330
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,720
Um, but back then, so the fact that this

331
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
principal investigator called me back

332
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,399
the next day, I was like, whoa, they're

333
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
actually interested in helping, you

334
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,880
know. So, I was quite shocked and

335
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,120
excited and my wife and I had this um he

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,200
left a a phone call actually. He left a

337
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,959
voicemail. We we like to call the the

338
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,920
perfect phone call, which we don't have

339
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,680
anymore, unfortunately. And in that

340
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,880
phone call, he basically said, "This

341
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,440
could be something that you could

342
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,320
qualify for. I'd like to talk to you."

343
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,480
And they did everything they could. This

344
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,639
was in 2019. Um, also, mind you, for 7

345
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,440
years, I had my wife and I had tried to

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,200
become parents and I'd been unsuccessful

347
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,800
in that regard. One of the reasons why

348
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,560
is because I was on a therapy called

349
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,120
hydroxyhea which um supposed to help

350
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,320
with cle cell disease in the um

351
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,160
expression of HBF um but very

352
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,199
inconsistent works with some people

353
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,519
doesn't work. So for me um as an

354
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,959
immature kid it didn't work and as adult

355
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,639
um I'm not sure if it worked. But anyway

356
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,920
I was on that and that had caused um you

357
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,600
know was one of the reasons why we

358
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,440
couldn't have children. But at this time

359
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,839
in 2019, my wife was actually 8 months

360
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,519
pregnant. Um because we had gone through

361
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,839
a round of IVF and that had become

362
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,760
successful. So my mindset was completely

363
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,079
different from where I was a few years

364
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,720
before where I didn't want to live to I

365
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,480
desperately need to need to be here. I

366
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,120
didn't want to pass the burden of

367
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,519
caregiving um to my children. I didn't

368
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,959
want to have my wife be the only one to

369
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,639
take care of our son. And I just kept on

370
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,279
having this picture of me in in the room

371
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
with the violent cle cell crisis and the

372
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,240
baby crying next door and not being able

373
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,120
to do anything. And so my mindset had

374
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,880
switched really quickly to desperately

375
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
wanting to be alive, which is such a

376
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,000
strange feeling for me from desperately

377
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,920
not wanting to be alive. Uh so I was

378
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,240
desperate for this clinical trial. Uh I

379
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,519
wanted I wanted to qualify. Uh they I

380
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,040
remember Vert.Ex text like sending that

381
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,639
big consent form or and it was massive

382
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,720
and I didn't even read it. I was just

383
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,079
like, "Where do I sign?" And they like,

384
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,639
"No, slow down. That's not how you do

385
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,720
this. You have to read before you sign."

386
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
And we read through it and I saw all

387
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
these, at least to my wife, all these

388
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,320
scary things of offtarget editing

389
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,240
potential for cancer. And I'm like, I I

390
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,480
don't care, you know, one, two, three

391
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,639
years, if this works, you know, is worth

392
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
it. If I live 3 years from this, even

393
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
one year, and I get hit by a bus the

394
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,120
next day, it's been it's been so worth

395
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,040
it that uh I don't mind going through

396
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,600
any of this to potentially get any of

397
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
this side effects because I I had unlike

398
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,680
Victoria, people try to call me brave

399
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,199
and maybe to an extent I am, but unlike

400
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,800
Victoria, she went into this with no

401
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
light at the end of the tunnel. No, she

402
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,720
was patient number one. So, she's

403
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,920
actually the definition of brave. Uh,

404
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,000
but I had the good fortune of looking at

405
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,240
her data and the other patients before

406
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,519
me and I I I had a feeling that this

407
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,399
could potentially work. So, I was all

408
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,000
in. Um, so I got

409
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,000
the good news. Uh, we we traveled to

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,480
Nashville. This was in 2019. We traveled

411
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,600
to Nashville in November where the which

412
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,759
was the study site and we went through a

413
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,079
series of tests where you have to be

414
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,639
sick enough but at the same time healthy

415
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,600
enough to go through the you know rigors

416
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,480
of a clinical trial which fortunately I

417
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,680
passed and in January of 2020 I began my

418
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,519
journey at the time I think it was

419
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,959
called CTX 101 uh in in the clinical

420
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,399
trial setting I I started that journey I

421
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,399
started off as uh patient number 16. Uh,

422
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,079
and at this time, my family and I, my

423
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,880
wife and I in particular, we've moved

424
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,800
down from New Jersey to the Atlanta

425
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,240
metro area in an attempt to just improve

426
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,559
my quality of life. Um, we were thinking

427
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,199
that living in a state that has a warmer

428
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,199
climate would make my cle cell disease a

429
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
lot better, which a little I think it

430
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,079
worked a little bit, but still, like I

431
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,679
said, you know, cle cell disease is

432
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,400
still going to do what cle cell disease

433
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,480
does. Um so at this time we're living in

434
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,919
the southeast and the clinical trial was

435
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,720
in Nashville which is also in the

436
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,480
southeast and as you all know 2020 uh

437
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,079
pandemic hit uh so when we started in I

438
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,480
think we started like literally January

439
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,240
2nd I had to report to Nashville and in

440
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,160
March they had to close down the

441
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,760
clinical trial um because of the

442
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,000
pandemic. Um, I started off as patient

443
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,480
number six, but because I 16 I should

444
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,080
say, uh, but because I lived in the

445
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,799
southeast, uh, they opened back the

446
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,240
trial and the principal investigator

447
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,520
reached out to me and told me, "Listen,

448
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
if you would like to continue, you could

449
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,000
drive. You know, all my other patients

450
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,880
that live in coastal cities or middle

451
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,960
America that can't fly anymore, they are

452
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,120
going to have to wait, but you you're 4

453
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,799
hours away. If you want to continue,

454
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,559
we're more than happy to continue." So

455
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,039
because of that, I actually got elevated

456
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,640
from patient number 16 to patient number

457
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,039
four. Um, which was um unreal. It was

458
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,440
kind of a weird thing, you know, looking

459
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,000
at that ticker at the bottom of the TV

460
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,240
and seeing people the the count people

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,640
losing their lives every day and here I

462
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,880
am getting the opportunity to save my

463
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,720
life. Um, you know, it was very very

464
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,360
strange. So, I continue with the

465
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,799
clinical trial and um I like telling

466
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,799
this part of the story because I've

467
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,640
gotten feedback that scientists actually

468
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,960
love hearing what the clinical

469
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,559
manifestation of a clinical trial looks

470
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,080
like. Um so, it is four steps. Um the

471
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,520
first step is something they call for

472
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
cle cell disease at least is something

473
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,120
they call keeping you on ice. Uh what

474
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,600
they mean by that is they basically

475
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,280
giving you red cell exchanges, blood

476
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
cell transfusions, making sure that

477
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,919
you're healthy. And then the second step

478
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,039
is uh the collection phase um where you

479
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,640
get collected. Um in my case you you get

480
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,320
woken up in the morning and you you

481
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,440
think the nurse is bringing you like

482
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,760
coffee or something but she's bringing

483
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,640
prolax and you get that shot and what

484
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,400
that does is it stimulates the um you

485
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,360
all know this the stem cells into the

486
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,679
blood cells and then it's collected for

487
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,840
eight hours. you sit sit next to an

488
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,160
ephreesis machine and it just sucks

489
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,640
blood and separates the stem cells but

490
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,960
in that process you lose a lot of blood

491
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,919
too. So uh at the end of every

492
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,440
collection I I needed a blood

493
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,600
transfusion. Uh for me I had to get

494
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,880
collected four times which was very

495
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,919
unusual. Um we really don't know why. Um

496
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,720
that's one of the biggest um

497
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,520
disappointments in the lack of clinical

498
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,039
trial diversity that why things happen

499
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,240
and and we don't know why. They're just

500
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,320
not many men that look like me enrolled

501
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,200
in clinical trials to figure out why

502
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,600
some of us have to get collected four

503
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,760
times someone once. Um so we need to do

504
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,080
more work there. And after the

505
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,840
collection process you go through the

506
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,799
conditioning phase which of course you

507
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,480
all know well. Um, for me, I think the

508
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,280
collection and the conditioning were

509
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,559
probably the most difficult part. Um,

510
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,880
I'd never had chemotherapy before. Um,

511
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,080
but you know, you see it on TV, you've

512
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,240
seen people that have cancer, and I was

513
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,799
under the impression that, you know,

514
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,960
once you get infused, I it was built for

515
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,640
about 5 days. Once you get infused with

516
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,640
that uh chemotherapy that you feel the

517
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,720
symptoms instantly um but that's not how

518
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,280
it works as you all know it probably

519
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,159
takes about two weeks and I was in the

520
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,720
mindset that I had somehow escaped the

521
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
symptoms of chemotherapy and they kept

522
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,480
on telling me no Jimmy that's not

523
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,080
possible I'm like it is it's been 5 days

524
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,080
I don't feel anything I've been working

525
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,240
out I'm on this bike I'm the best

526
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,880
clinical trial patient ever all that

527
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,000
stuff and Dr. Franco who was the P just

528
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,000
kept on laughing. Oh man. So I went into

529
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,880
when the symptoms finally came it was

530
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,840
kind of really sad because I I I thought

531
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,760
I had kind of mindseted my way positive

532
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,360
mindset out of my way out of um

533
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,440
chemotherapy symptoms which was not the

534
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,679
case. It eventually came and it was it

535
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,840
hit me like a train. Um I think the

536
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,520
hardest thing was the mouth sores. You

537
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,679
you really don't understand how

538
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,480
debilitating mouth sores can be. Like

539
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,480
there's no amount of explanation I can

540
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
give you that you to tell you how

541
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,200
painful it is unless you just go through

542
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,200
it yourself. You know that's how bad it

543
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,760
is. And after that conditioning the

544
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,559
final stage is the infusion which was um

545
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,320
extremely antilimactic. Um, I literally

546
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,640
saw them take bags of stem cell, red

547
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,640
stem cell bloods out of me for like two

548
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,880
months and the carrier will be right

549
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,520
there before the collection was ended

550
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
and shipping it with all this urgency.

551
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,679
And at the end of the day, they come

552
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,320
back with like three clear syringes. I'm

553
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,320
like, that's it. Uh, and that was it. It

554
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,559
was just three clear syringes and the

555
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,440
smell of canned corn, which apparently

556
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:11,039
is preservatives. Um, and you know, you

557
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,159
get infused with with that. And for me,

558
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,240
and it's going to be different for

559
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,320
everybody, I think it was about

560
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,799
probably 7 days, maybe two weeks max,

561
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,440
that um, with my cle cell disease, I've

562
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,039
always had this lingering pain um that I

563
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,520
couldn't escape even with pain

564
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,760
medication. And I noticed that pain

565
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,840
slowly start to dissipate. And um I was

566
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,000
in a really really weird place because I

567
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,919
was expecting to be excited, happy that

568
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,640
you know for me this is the beginning of

569
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,360
the end of cle cell disease but I was

570
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,520
actually kind of lost and worried um

571
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,720
because I'd lived with cle cell disease

572
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,760
for 35 years to finally disengage from

573
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,600
the disease. I I really didn't know who

574
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,360
I was meant to be or how I was meant to

575
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,039
move on. My my my wife when we got

576
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,080
married literally told me your one job

577
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,320
in life was to not die. So I had no life

578
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,360
skills except for not dying.

579
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,760
Um so um and for so long I had used pain

580
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,159
as a way to motivate myself. Um you know

581
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm going to do this as well as you can

582
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,799
and I'm going to do with pain was my

583
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,720
mindset. I had like a quote on my desk

584
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,159
that said never waste your pain and now

585
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,760
I had no more pain. So, I went through a

586
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:29,600
serious identity crisis that uh and uh a

587
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,559
really bad um survivor's guilt. Um this

588
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,000
came after um when I realized that after

589
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:39,840
I'd come public with my story that these

590
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,679
gene therapies cost $2.3 to $3 million.

591
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,320
And I'd gone public with my story

592
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,320
talking about how great it could

593
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,039
potentially be physically, at least how

594
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,840
great it's been for me, not knowing that

595
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:55,120
the bulk of the population is not going

596
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,159
to have access to it anytime soon. Uh,

597
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,360
and it was it was tragic to to even when

598
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,960
the approval came in 2023, um, to know

599
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,039
that we now have a bonafide gene therapy

600
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:12,400
too actually for cle cell disease. And

601
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:15,840
the patient population in dire need of

602
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,720
these therapies are not all of them are

603
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,760
many of them are going to die without

604
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,000
having this therapy. And um that's when

605
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,640
I really dedicated myself to you know

606
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,360
doing everything I can in my power um my

607
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,600
very limited power to try and make sure

608
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,360
these therapies eventually um get to the

609
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,320
patient populations that are in dire

610
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,799
need of it. I mean cle cell disease is

611
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,960
the rarest the most populous rarest

612
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,600
disease in the world. 100,000 Americans

613
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,799
suffer from it. Um 4 million people in

614
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,200
subsaran Africa 100,000 babies are born

615
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,880
a year. 12 million

616
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,679
globally

617
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:01,120
and 35 maybe more than that 50 people

618
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,720
worldwide have received a gene therapy

619
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:09,520
for cle cell disease. Um it's the the

620
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,919
numbers are just staggering. Um and so

621
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,919
when uh a gentleman called Luke

622
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,240
Timberman reached out to me, hey, we're

623
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,840
doing this campaign um with a company

624
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,440
called Sickle Forward to raise money to

625
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,080
purchase uh to acquire basics like

626
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,679
newborn screening, hydroxyera, newborn

627
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,720
screening obviously very pivotal in my

628
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,919
survival. You know, I jumped at the

629
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,919
chance. Um, you know, there was a bit of

630
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,320
uproar in the community that what is

631
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,240
this kid that still has cickle cell

632
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,080
disease going to do in Kilanjaro when we

633
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,320
both know that he's still going to

634
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,400
sickle. Um, and he's not supposed to be

635
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,720
over 10,000 foot in altitude. Um, but to

636
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,320
be fair, the goal you the the organizers

637
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,320
that told me that the goal for me wasn't

638
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,960
actually to summit Kilimanjaro is just

639
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
to be there and advocate. Um, so I

640
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,360
jumped at the chance. anything I could

641
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,360
do um to make sure that we can get more

642
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,840
people eventually when these gene

643
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,720
therapies eventually proliferate you

644
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,880
know alive and with a somewhat healthy

645
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,320
quality of life the only way to do that

646
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,120
is one making sure that they know they

647
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,120
have cle cell disease and two you know

648
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,000
when they are have you know early

649
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,679
intervention with with hydroxyheeria so

650
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
I was excited to do it and to be fair

651
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,919
I'd already been you know for the first

652
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,240
time I finally had full control of my

653
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,159
And I'd already been um physically in in

654
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,240
in good physical shape that I thought I

655
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,640
could do it. There's this Stoic quote

656
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,960
that I like. It's it's better to be a

657
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,039
warrior in the garden than a garden in a

658
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,640
war. And I'd been doing that my whole

659
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,039
life. So I'd like, oh, absolutely. This

660
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,039
is a challenge I can take on. So, you

661
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,200
know, we started training for Kilanjyro

662
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,279
all summer of last year. I did all the

663
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
peaks on the eastern seabboard in North

664
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,080
Carolina. And then eventually we went to

665
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,720
Colorado to do um some high altitude

666
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,880
training. um we got to 14,000 and I

667
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,640
think that's when my teammates and I

668
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,480
started um realizing there's a potential

669
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,799
that this kid could actually summit

670
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,840
Kilamanjaro you know and I'm sure most

671
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,640
of you know that um the gene therapy I

672
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,919
went through castvi doesn't um attack

673
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,480
the cle cell mutation it goes for bcl1a

674
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,480
silences it and then you produce uh

675
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,400
hemoglobin F which we all used to

676
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,200
produce in uterero and with the

677
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,159
production of HBF apparently it has a

678
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,440
better affinity for oxygen. And I

679
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,000
actually saw that on in Colorado before

680
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,039
we were gotten to to to to Kilara when

681
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,919
my some of my teammates were exhausted

682
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,240
and h having a high autism and I the one

683
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,840
with diagnosed cle cell disease I was

684
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,600
still able to continue going. I'm like

685
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,679
oh wow maybe I am cheating here with

686
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,880
HBF and um you know it's a good thing.

687
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,640
So so we get to Kilanjaro and um it was

688
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,480
extremely hard. We couldn't have made it

689
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,960
without the porters. I see my teammate

690
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,919
here, Doug, who we summitted Kilanjaro

691
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,760
together. We shared a car from Arouchia

692
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,000
to Kilanjaro and we've become good

693
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,760
friends today. Um, and it was extremely

694
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,360
difficult. Um, but like I said, I had

695
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,919
been training. The physical part of it

696
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,559
for me, um, I think living with cle cell

697
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,760
disease, I I knew I could handle the

698
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,720
physicality of the climb. It was, um,

699
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,919
the altitude that we were kind of weary

700
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,200
of. And beforehand I had done some tests

701
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,279
with my friend Patrick Hines who um runs

702
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,080
a company called Functional Fluidics

703
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,399
where they test red blood cell health.

704
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,320
So they had induced hypoxia into my red

705
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,320
blood cells and they saw that there is a

706
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,159
chance I mean there absolutely

707
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,559
effectively I have the cle cell trait.

708
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,399
So for sure in extreme situations I

709
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,960
would sickle. And when we got to 15,000

710
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,039
ft, I remember that morning I went and I

711
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,039
peed and I noticed for the first time in

712
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,640
like 5 years my pee was brown. But I

713
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,240
didn't really bring it up to anybody.

714
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm like, "Of course my pee is going to

715
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,640
be brown. I'm I'm doing something

716
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,399
extremely hard." And then it wasn't

717
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,840
until like lunchtime in the tent,

718
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,120
Patrick ran to me and like, "Jimmy,

719
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,120
you're jaundice. I don't know if you've

720
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,559
noticed." Um, and that's when I like,

721
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,720
"Oh, well, maybe this is actually

722
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,440
serious." So they decided to put me on

723
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,600
oxygen prophylactively for the rest of

724
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,880
the hike which was disappointing. I had

725
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,679
this oxygen tank on the whole time while

726
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,919
I was you know um summit in Kilamanjaro.

727
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,760
Uh but with the oxygen helped um there

728
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,200
were no other adverse effects. I every

729
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,440
night, you know, when we would go to bed

730
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,240
in our tents, I was just making that

731
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,000
mental decision. You know, if this is

732
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,159
actually something that's dangerous, if

733
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
you start to feel like a true crisis,

734
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,320
you know, you have to make sure that

735
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,240
you're honest with yourself and you

736
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,600
start to

737
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,840
descend. And if you if you if your eyes

738
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,039
are just yellow, if it's just ja, I'm

739
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,720
going to continue. So, I made that

740
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,000
decision. I was going to continue unless

741
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,120
I started feeling something different

742
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,559
physically. And thankfully, I didn't

743
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,480
feel anything different physically. I

744
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,640
felt tired, exhausted like anyone but

745
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,000
nothing like what cle cell disease used

746
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,679
to be like. Um and then you know um

747
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,320
summit night we did it the whole team

748
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,440
all of us we did and like like I I think

749
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,520
for me I've really learned to detach

750
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,799
myself from outcomes because summiting

751
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,960
was antilimactic as well. Um while it

752
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,520
was a personal goal I really love the

753
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,240
journey the bond you build while you're

754
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,480
climbing the every day the grind one

755
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,200
step at a time. That was the the fun

756
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,840
part of it for me and um yeah it while

757
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,520
that was a personal achievement um in

758
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,919
being the first person with cle cell

759
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,399
disease to summit Kilimanjaro I think

760
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,360
the important thing was the trip um we

761
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,480
were able to raise $1.2 $2 million and

762
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,720
we got the goal of getting newborn

763
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,200
screening and hydroxyeria to a patient

764
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,480
population that's in desperate need of

765
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,799
cle cell. They don't have access to the

766
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,320
basics. Um and what we find out what we

767
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
found out while we were in Kilamanjaro

768
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,480
some of them don't even know what cle

769
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,240
cell disease is in the metro cities in

770
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
countries across Africa they they might

771
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,960
know but in in in the villages in the

772
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,600
farms people there don't know what cle

773
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,159
cell disease is. So this was uh to be

774
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,080
able to achieve this and bring some

775
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,640
education uh to these populations and

776
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,120
you know take a very small step into

777
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,720
preserving their quality of life till

778
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,360
eventually gene therapy becomes

779
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,720
accessible um was was huge aside from

780
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,399
the personal achievement. Uh and you

781
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,279
know it's been it's been great ever

782
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,960
since um in terms of continuing to do

783
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,880
the advocacy work.

784
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,679
Um my goal is really just making sure

785
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,679
that these therapies um as an advocate

786
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,480
one day get get to the patient

787
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,640
populations that are in need of it. Um

788
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,240
one of the things that I think um Dr.

789
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,320
Weissman talked about it and we're

790
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,240
seeing a lot as well in cle cell disease

791
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,840
come up is a lot of clinical trials with

792
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,320
invivo um gene therapies focusing on

793
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,480
LMPS lipid lipid nanopaticals to to

794
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,159
eventually get these therapies to to

795
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,960
patients that desperately need them. But

796
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,720
also we have to, you know, as a patient,

797
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,399
I'm not going to sit here and um

798
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,360
pontificate because I have no idea, but

799
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:21,120
we have to work on these um IP issues. I

800
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,279
have no idea why an IP cost five to six

801
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,200
to seven to tens of millions of dollars.

802
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,720
But you know, when I put my patient hat

803
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,039
on, I see that as a barrier to getting

804
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,360
patients to the other side of a chronic

805
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,159
illness. Um so while I'm here at the

806
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,840
broad where you know most of these

807
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,760
research comes from I really want to

808
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,240
encourage while you're working on this

809
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,440
science the research that I know I

810
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,760
should have had some slides that could

811
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,799
have hit home a bit more but just um

812
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,480
think of patients like me um that would

813
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,240
not be here if it wasn't for gene

814
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,360
therapy and how many are not going to be

815
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,159
here and how many you could potentially

816
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,080
save if the work that you're doing can

817
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,080
get to them you know so I just wanted to

818
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,080
leave you guys with that message. Thank

819
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,640
you, Jimmy. Thank you. Uh I know I speak

820
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,880
for all of us when I say thank you for

821
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,120
your advocacy and also for sharing your

822
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,120
story today.
