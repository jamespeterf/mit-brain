1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Nicholas Tomcho. I'm

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,879
professor of architecture. Um, currently

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,360
head of the architecture department. I'm

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,200
also professor of urban studies and

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,719
planning and affiliated faculty with the

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,440
program in science, technology, and

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,160
society. I grew up in Sydney, Australia

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,720
and moved here to Boston when I was in

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,400
middle school for my dad to work at MIT,

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,359
which is why I never thought I would

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,199
come to MIT. Um but I ended up being

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,920
interested in um architecture and cities

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,840
and uh also technology which I was

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,760
exposed to certainly here at MIT growing

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,200
up. And then I uh worked trained as an

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,079
architect, worked as an architect in

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,160
London and New York. Uh started teaching

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
um in a program first in a program in

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
architecture and landscape architecture

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,719
at the University of Virginia and then

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,399
at UC Berkeley for 15 years. and then

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,239
somehow they convinced me to come back

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,120
here to MIT in 2020. Here my um head of

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,120
a department of architecture. Uh I think

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,159
uh a lot of what we do today is about

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,640
really challenging what that word means

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,560
in the in the current context. We uh

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,799
when we ask students to think about what

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,720
a building is today, uh we don't ask

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
them to think about it as a singular

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,960
object. We ask them to think about it as

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,360
an intervention in an urban system, as

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,479
an intervention in an ecological system.

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:28,320
and um uh I think with a with a kind of

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,159
deep ethical obligation to be um a

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,159
driver of positive change in all the

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
systems that it's connected to. And so

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
if you think about a building as a

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
catalyst and not an object, you get to a

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,720
very different idea of what architecture

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,320
is in the world today. Architecture is a

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,159
very important agent of change in the

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
world. And I think also the practice of

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,880
architecture has to change. And so for

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,560
me, my work as the head of the

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,399
architecture department here at MIT is

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,119
incredibly important because it brings

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,280
together this uh enormous history of

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,320
architectural practice um in North

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,560
America that MIT is a catalyst of and it

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,880
also um brings together um uh that

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,280
tradition with the research context of

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,959
MIT which is such a huge driver of

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
change and transformation in the

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
profession. Historically, it's been that

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,680
way. MIT invented the first CAD system,

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,959
the first CNC system, the first plastic

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
house, you know, all these things came

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,959
from MIT. And so, you know, my hope is

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,920
that this department can in the best way

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,520
possible and as much as it can be um a

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,400
real agent of change in the practice of

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,879
architecture today. I talk about how

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,920
when I was being trained as an

65
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,440
architect, I I one of the reasons I

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,040
studied architecture is because I love

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,640
to draw. Um, and the the definition of

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,720
design that I was introduced to was

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,560
design is drawing. You you you draw

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
something and then it's built. But that

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
definition of design only really dates

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,720
from the 13th or 14th century when

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,640
architects started to be too busy with

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,120
multiple buildings to be on site all the

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,440
time. But it's really taken over um uh

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,159
in our conception of what design is. we

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,319
uh have a kind of genius you know

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,360
whether it's Michelangelo or Johnny IV

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,200
like outlining something delineating it

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,879
maybe working with prototypes but then

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
raw materials are extracted from the

82
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
earth and a whole bunch of it is built

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,560
whether it's buildings or consumer

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,640
objects or uh you name it whereas the

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,599
original meaning meaning of design that

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,519
um uh that the original uh Latin root of

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,000
the word has is talks much more about

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,239
what I think design needs to be today

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,159
which is a kind of strategic thinking

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,480
about the world, thinking about

91
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,319
resources, thinking about how we name

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
things, how we designate things, and

93
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,959
where we are now in history,

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
particularly in the context of the

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
climate crisis. I think this idea of

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,480
shaping something that's then built and

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,040
thrown away is is um uh no longer useful

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,959
and we really need to um both move

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
forward and also maybe also move back to

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,680
that uh historic meaning of the word

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,680
design. pre-industrial in some senses.

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,519
Um I think um you know a pre-industrial

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
economy was a more circular economy and

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
that's what we need to move back to.

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
Although there's huge parts of what

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
we've you know built in the world in the

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,920
last 100 years that I'm very fond of and

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,920
wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't want to lose

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
either.
