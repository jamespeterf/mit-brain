1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,120
So up next we have Yen. She's a posttock

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,480
at the Ericcomi Schmidt center and

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,040
she'll be giving a talk about

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,560
segmentation free analysis of submicron

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,359
resolution spatial transcrytoics

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
right uh we've heard about spatialics in

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,960
this section. So spatial traptomic

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,080
technologies uh have been developing

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,320
rapidly in the recent years. Um two of

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,640
the key aspect of those technologies are

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
the spatial resolution and the number of

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
genes profiled. So imaging based

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,280
technologies can measure the precise

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,079
location of every molecules but can only

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
profile a pre-esigned gene panel and

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
commercial platforms expanding their

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,559
throughput scaling from a few hundred to

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480
thousands of genes. Sequencing based

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,879
technologies on the other hand can

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,800
violously profile the whole

21
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,879
transcriptton but earlier technologies

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,840
have rather low resolution at a

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,040
multisellular scale. So more recent

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,880
technology like six scope and sterosk um

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,360
have achieved submicron resolution

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
comparable to

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,240
microscope. So our method are designed

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,680
for any special transcript data that

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,960
with subtle

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,720
resolution. So the data from such

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,439
technologies are specially resolved

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,520
transcripts. Each pixel contains one or

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,000
a couple of transcripts. Here the color

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,400
representing different gene identities.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,439
So such high resolution

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,000
uh and high throughput data does not

37
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,799
automatically enable high throughput

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,880
imprints. A basic task of data analysis

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,759
is recover cells and their cellular

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,920
functions. The current standard approach

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,640
is to use nuclei staining and cell

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
boundary markers to perform cell

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,880
segmentation before doing single cell

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,320
level analysis. However, high quality

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,399
imaging information is not always

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,040
available especially for some sequencing

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,119
based platforms.

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
So even when cell segmentation is

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,280
physible is still a challenging task

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,719
since we have we are making a

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
two-dimensional section from a

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,879
three-dimensional tissue the

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,440
cross-section of a cell is of often of

54
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,920
reg irregular shape and some self nuclei

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,400
may not be captured in this 2D wheel and

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
they may be missed from downstream

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,520
analysis. So there are more techn

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
technical difficulties in practice that

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,200
jointly resulting in perfect cell

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
segmentation.

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,160
An alternative way is to do grid based

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,080
analysis to collapse those sparse

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,200
information from individual pixels into

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,720
bigger unit in able to do statistical

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,760
analysis. This approach can use all the

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,080
transcript but lose spatial resolution

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,640
and obtain such a grid contain a mixture

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,879
of different cell types.

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,959
The ideal solution should annotate

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,920
cellular function at each individual

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,080
pixel and do so efficiently for large uh

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,319
tissue regions. And this is what we aim

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
to

74
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,519
achieve. So here's the intuition behind

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,840
our method. So we start from a hexagonal

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,319
grid and infer each hexagon as a mixture

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,040
of multiple latent factors representing

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,200
a cellular functions. These factors can

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
be learned in no from the data. But we

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,560
could also incorporate prior knowledge

81
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
or use external single cell reference

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,159
panel. We call the center of the

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,159
hexagons as anchor point. And then we

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,480
slide this grid to generate a denser

85
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,560
letters of such anchors. But at this

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,239
stage each anchor still represent the

87
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,400
mixture. So the key step is to allow

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
each pixel to look around and pick which

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,159
anchor it goes to. And then the anchors

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,440
will collect those pixel and update

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,480
their fraction uh their factor

92
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,640
proportions. When this process

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,840
converges, we have a probability factor

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,640
assignment of every single

95
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,879
pixel. We will use um public data from

96
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,120
four different platform to show that our

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,840
method works in practice. But we do

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,480
emphasize that we uh we works for data

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,200
from all such cellular subscellular

100
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,120
technologies, right? Um sterile seek is

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,439
a next generation sequencing based

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,920
technology. This is a 16-day mouse

103
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
embryo session. Over 750 million

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,879
transcript are captured but only 40% of

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,799
them are assigned to any cell because on

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,919
this platform only nuclear staining was

107
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,199
available. So cell segmentation is very

108
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,440
challenging. On the left is the

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,160
published cell level annotation. On the

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,560
right is our unbiased uh is our

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,680
unsupervised pixel level analysis

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,240
without using a nuclear information.

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,120
we recover or similar global structure

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,240
but with additional details. One example

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,560
I want to show is the developing muscle

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,440
tissues. So during myiogenesis myoblast

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,040
matures into myophiber cell segmentation

118
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,600
is particularly difficult for the later

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,240
stage with this nuc m multi-ucleated

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,240
fiber-l like cells. The top right panel

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
shows nuclear staining and the bottom is

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,080
a published cell segmentation based

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
analysis colored by annotated cell

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,840
types.

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
We cannot see mature muscle fiber in

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
this view and almost all the cells were

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
labeled as

128
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,759
myoblast. However, when we applied our

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,320
method, we see the emerging strided

130
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,880
muscle cells. The top image color each

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,360
pixel as our inferred latent factors and

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,680
the bottom highlight two two factors.

133
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
The red pixel coming from myoblast and

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,120
the yellow pixel belonging to

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,680
differentiated muscle cells.

136
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
So imaging based platform often have

137
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,880
higher high quality imaging with

138
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,840
multiple channel to support better cell

139
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,080
segmentation. So let's look at the

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,680
muscle tissue at this mouse pop data

141
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,960
from zenium with 5,000

142
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,240
panel. So in the middle is um the image

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,639
with nuclei staining and cell membrane

144
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,880
markers. On the right is a standard cell

145
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,759
level analysis. On the left is features

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,840
output. The color here also represent

147
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,880
the inferred Ling factors and we label

148
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,880
them by the signature genes. The purple

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
background here is has a signature of

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,000
immature muscle fiber. The yellow marks

151
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,560
the same fiber-l like structure located

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,440
between muscle cells that are has the

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,520
signature of fibroblast. Another type of

154
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,960
inter muscle signal we see is from

155
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,360
endothelial cells in green. So uh well

156
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,520
in this data the cell segmentation is

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,280
quite good but still the fine scale

158
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,080
tissue structure is

159
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,360
lost right um the next example is from

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,479
brain tissue here's a mouse half brain

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,880
with uh from cosmics again there are

162
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,759
almost 40% of transcript were lost in

163
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,400
single cell level analysis let's look at

164
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,639
one such uh cell sparse region near

165
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,520
hippoc

166
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:51,520
campus so starting From this gr um this

167
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,360
uh granu cell layer uh we have three

168
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,840
distinct molecular layer that are filled

169
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,479
with dendrid and axon but not uh does

170
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,479
not have dense cell

171
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,039
bodies. Um between the dendritic layer

172
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,800
of hippocampus and the cortex we have

173
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:10,000
the white matter uh track that are u

174
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,639
dominated by melaninated axons. The cell

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,280
body inside this uh layer are indeed

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
melaninating

177
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,400
olodendrites. Right in the cortex we

178
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
also observe a diff different expression

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,280
pattern near nuclei versus other part of

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,000
the cell. Um here the green factor here

181
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,319
um uh often appear at the center of the

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,680
cell body is enriched for two long

183
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,599
non-coding arrays retain the nuclei and

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
different neuron may share this nuclei

185
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,560
signature while having distinct

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
dendroitic or synaptic

187
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,800
activities. Um we check another public

188
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,720
brain data from Moscope to see if we

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,639
observe similar subset of loop pattern

190
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,199
in a different technology and from a

191
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,400
human instead of mouse u especially in

192
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,479
this case those nuclei markers are not

193
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:08,240
available in the gene panel.

194
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,280
So although the nuclei um non long

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,479
coding RNAs are not uh present the model

196
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,240
still seem to learn a soma specific

197
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,800
signature the signature gene of the red

198
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,560
factor encoding encode neurotransmitter

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
receptor and voltage gated channel

200
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,120
subunit that are predominantly located

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,879
in the cell body and the pink and yellow

202
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,840
are um both enriched for MRA targeted

203
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,159
for dendrites or presinaptic channels uh

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,760
terminals and they seem to be from

205
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,760
different two sub uh two different

206
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,279
subtypes, right? Um another major

207
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,920
application of spatial omics data is

208
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,560
cancer biology. So here is a human

209
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,480
breast cancer tissue from 10x Indian.

210
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,519
The release data includes cell

211
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,000
segmentation based on nuclei. Um we will

212
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,920
zoom in in this regions uh around the

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,080
duct ductal caroma in situ. So the top

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,560
right hisystologology image shows edipo

215
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,120
tissue. The empty spots are created by

216
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,959
large lipid droplets in edipo size where

217
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,360
no RNA is present. The nuclei of edipo

218
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,760
size are much smaller than the cell body

219
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,200
and located at a cell boundary. Often

220
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,680
there are immune cell that are much

221
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,240
smaller and located between edipo sites.

222
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,320
The cell segmentation from line uh from

223
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
t platform is quite misleading in this

224
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,640
region because nuclearizing is just not

225
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,360
very informative.

226
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,760
So our uh approach is not affected by

227
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,000
such cell morphology. The top right

228
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,839
panel shows color each pixel by our

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
inferred factors. The bottom one we

230
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,800
highlight uh edible sites in yellow and

231
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
indothelial cells in blue. We also

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,279
identify different immune cell

233
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,279
population in this region. So overall uh

234
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,920
we provide a more realistic picture of

235
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
the underlying

236
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,480
biology. Right. In breast cancer cancer

237
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
associated fibroblast and extracellular

238
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,040
matrix are major component of tumor

239
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,360
micro environment and are important for

240
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,720
cancer progression. So here we use

241
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,120
another uh public data from uh breast

242
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,959
cancer tissue in mcope to show the

243
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,959
potential advantage of our approach. In

244
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:22,000
this case on the left the white p uh the

245
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,480
white pixels are shows the extracellular

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,560
matrix building related signature. They

247
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,279
are in the region also reach in tumor

248
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,320
associated macrofage. On the right we

249
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,720
see the co-loization of this uh two

250
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,480
factors in a different context. The

251
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,040
light green pixel well uh with this

252
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,279
similar uh fiberl like structure are

253
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,720
also cancer rel uh cancer associated

254
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,600
fibroblast but it has a different

255
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,160
functional signature.

256
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:55,839
So if we look at uh the image um uh this

257
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,600
region is actually uh cell sparse um

258
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,079
those fibroblast does not seem to be

259
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,800
well captured by cell boundary markers.

260
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,640
Comparing with cell level view uh our

261
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
approach is perhaps better suited to

262
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,839
study tumor micro environment in a more

263
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,760
unbiased

264
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,200
way. Right? So not only does feature

265
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,279
provide biologically meaningful

266
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,680
inference across platforms but is

267
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,360
lightweight and highly scalable. So here

268
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,120
we compare with two representative

269
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,800
method beta has been well uh one of the

270
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
most accurate pixel level analysis

271
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,440
method but it's not designed for such

272
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,000
for current high school data and the

273
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,720
memory requirement is prohibitive for a

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,600
fraction of the state of bar data set. A

275
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,760
graph is a method that use popular graph

276
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,519
neural network. It works at lower

277
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,880
resolution and or require segmented

278
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:49,000
cells. Um but still is is the projected

279
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,120
cost for analyzing large data is quite

280
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,839
huge. So we uh we have adjustable memory

281
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,240
budget in that's independent of the size

282
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,800
of the data set.

283
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,800
In terms of runtime, uh we scales

284
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,200
linearly with a number of transcript and

285
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,920
can be massively parallelized. We either

286
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,880
scale superlinearly and cannot scale to

287
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,680
more than a thousand genes. And well,

288
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,480
our pixel level inference is even more

289
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,079
scalable uh efficient than the cell

290
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,240
level inference from from the graph

291
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,160
neuron

292
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,320
network. So in summary, we present a

293
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,720
segmentation free analysis tool that

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,000
infers cellular function of set micron

295
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,480
resolution. It applies data from any

296
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,160
subtitular level platforms is orders of

297
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
magnitude more efficient than existing

298
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,200
method and is built for future large

299
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,320
scale multis sample data set and it does

300
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,880
not rely or im limited by imaging based

301
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
cell

302
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,720
segmentation. Uh we just made public a

303
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,360
new version of our software and we are

304
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,320
actively working on new functionalities

305
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
to support different use cases. Um, I'm

306
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,160
looking for collaboration and maybe

307
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,760
looking for a drop soon. With that, I'd

308
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,410
like to thank all the wonderful people

309
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:08,680
I've worked with and happy to take any

310
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:10,880
[Applause]

311
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,440
questions. Think we have time for one or

312
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,440
two more questions.

313
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,760
So I I guess as the spatial technologies

314
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,519
get like finer and finer resolution, uh

315
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,959
do you foresee this kind of continuing

316
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,200
to be uh a question of doing this in a

317
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,880
self-free manner versus segmenting like

318
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,399
going forward with the way spatial

319
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,920
technologies are developing? How do you

320
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,920
see this uh being used?

321
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm not quite understanding the

322
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,760
question. Um

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,480
so well spatial resolution is proving

324
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,920
but there's a physical limit of what you

325
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,519
can measure because after some point for

326
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,920
imaging based platform you have this

327
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,760
optical crowding issue for sequencing

328
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,440
based well we are doing slightly better

329
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,639
but still um there's a lateral diffusion

330
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,560
of transcript so I'm not entirely sure

331
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,720
how much we can improve upon current

332
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,720
technology in terms of resolution.

333
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,620
Thanks.

334
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,409
Okay, let's thank each one more time.

335
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,409
[Applause]
