1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,040
hello open course Weare Learners this is

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,800
Professor cber talking to you and I just

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,279
wanted to say a little bit about why the

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,880
next two classes are not to be found um

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,320
on this site MIT and the music

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,240
department was very fortunate to be able

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,399
to hire a new professor in computation

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,280
music that semester and one of the

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,719
things that we value as a department is

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,640
people's ability to be good teachers so

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,680
as part of their interview U the

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,480
candidates came and took over one of the

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,680
classes to uh teach the content of the

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,680
class and a little bit of their

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,320
Specialties too and two of those classes

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,079
were um that were used were this class

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,079
21 M

18
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,840
383 both of the Cates I can say did

19
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,360
amazing work and I wish I could share

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,400
them their videos with you but we have a

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,280
feeling that it's already stressful

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,680
enough to be doing a job interview and

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,799
to have your teaching being evaluated by

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,479
people in the room uh and then to know

25
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,320
that whatever things you did in an

26
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,799
unfamiliar classroom with unfamiliar

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,560
students would also be put out online uh

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,000
it's just a little bit too much so these

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,399
too ask too much to ask so these videos

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,920
are not available I want to say a little

31
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:39,960
bit though what was in each of

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,040
them the first class was the

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,960
continuation of our series on music

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,280
cognition and computation and how

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,000
computers can Aid the process of

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,640
understanding how the brain processes

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,759
music and also how historically and I

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,479
think in the

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,360
future uh insights from music cognition

40
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,880
have improved the things that we do on

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,039
the computer uh the most important uh

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,879
example of this is Carol Crum hansel's

43
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:17,920
um probe

44
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:22,519
tone uh experiments uh in understanding

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,879
musical expectation in scales and keys

46
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:30,360
and these experiments which helped you

47
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:32,400
understand how each note plays in our

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,680
ability to understand what key we're in

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,519
at this point underlies a quite a number

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,959
of algorithms being used today by

51
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,879
computers to automatically detect the

52
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,840
keys of compositions and this includes

53
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:51,080
music 21's default analyze key method

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,920
and this is why the assignments on

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,200
understanding uh key

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:01,120
analysis went hand inand with the

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,879
section on cognition

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,480
the lecture also covered and gave the

59
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,319
opportunity to discuss some of the

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,480
experiments reported by David hon in his

61
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:15,120
book sweet anticipation of which the

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,360
students were assigned to do

63
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,000
readings I would encourage as a

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,920
substitute for the content of this

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,360
lecture for you to look deeply at this

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,360
book

67
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:34,080
by a prominent U music cognition and

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,000
expert and also one of the Breakthrough

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,239
founders of our field of computational

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,400
Music Theory musicology David

71
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,599
hiron doing so I think would give a good

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
sense of the majority of what was

73
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,879
contained in the

74
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:56,879
lecture beyond what uh the candidate

75
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,879
spoke about her own particular

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,400
expertise the second guest lecturer

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,400
covered the topic of the history of

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,959
algorithmic composition from its

79
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,879
Beginnings even before the computer

80
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,440
until today and this lecture

81
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,680
covered the main reading for this week

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,080
which is on the iliac

83
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,000
Suite uh the one of the first pieces to

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,919
be composed by computers using

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,880
algorithms and to generate notes and

86
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,240
continuing up till to today with

87
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,520
advances in AI such as the music

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,600
Transformer by Anna Hong at Google and

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,039
other uh other new developments one of

90
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,919
the reasons why it's so important to

91
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,800
look

92
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,199
at music algorithmic music composition

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,800
in sort of a broader historical scope is

94
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,000
it's too easy to get hung up on the

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,720
particular problem that we have today

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,240
where we're getting closer and closer to

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,680
having the computer produce musical

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,840
scores that sound like other

99
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,039
compositions like by particular

100
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,639
composers and to work on that problem

101
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:19,479
without asking well why why should we

102
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:22,479
care why do we want the computer to

103
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:26,080
compose a new piece in the style of

104
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,319
Johan Sebastian Bach unless by chance

105
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,680
you've already heard every piece by Bach

106
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:35,160
and you're just bored and you need more

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
which most of us haven't explored what's

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,000
actually out

109
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,520
there

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280
instead by looking back at the earliest

111
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,199
history when having a computer actually

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,720
write music at that level of

113
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,360
sophistication was so far from being

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,840
possible and looking at what people

115
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,039
wanted to do with the computer it helps

116
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:03,639
to answer questions how can the computer

117
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:05,840
be used to to come up with ideas or take

118
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,360
ideas that I have that will take too

119
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,720
long for me to generate on my own and

120
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,919
make that part more efficient how can it

121
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,919
be a tool to help me be a better human

122
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:23,840
composer or just better

123
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,520
human so the class went through some of

124
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,240
the earliest algorithmic compositions

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,639
from Guido of areto a monk living in the

126
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,000
11th century through Mozart's musical

127
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,240
dice games up until the ilak suite and

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,960
then

129
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,319
beyond some of what's covered in this

130
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,560
class also appears in the various videos

131
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:52,479
that accompany this class that weren't

132
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,000
shown to students this year but uh are

133
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,199
available for

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,360
you and other aspects touched on the

135
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,520
guest speaker particular expertise which

136
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,879
was very valuable to be brought in

137
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,039
anybody else teaching this class would

138
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,120
bring in her his own Specialties that

139
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,759
would be make that class different from

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,960
mine and nobody should teach this class

141
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,639
exactly the same way I would teach it or

142
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,759
have taught it so that gives a little

143
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:28,199
bit of a nutshell of what's happening

144
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,879
the students then went on to write their

145
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,319
own algorithms to to generate

146
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:37,759
compositions algorithmically and they

147
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,800
did a very good job of avoiding the

148
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,360
problem of trying to get the computer to

149
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,759
do something that we already do better

150
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,039
that we are not interested really in the

151
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,759
computer's

152
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,560
output

153
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:57,879
and that we just would only want to

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,680
listen to if we knew a human created and

155
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,599
instead they went beyond that and

156
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,159
created piece of music that were

157
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,120
interesting in themselves and that no

158
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,120
human would ever choose to

159
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,199
write in addition to the two classes

160
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:20,479
that job candidates uh covered two other

161
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,599
classes at around this time needed to

162
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:28,560
be uh removed and the contents pushed

163
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,759
into other classes because MIT was in

164
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,120
the process of

165
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,080
proposing to the full faculty a new

166
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,680
master's program two new Master's

167
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,360
programs in in music technology and

168
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,560
computation and it happened that these

169
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,839
uh proposals had to happen at the same

170
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,920
time as this class and so a little bit

171
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,600
of time was lost on that I'm hoping that

172
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
if you've been interested in this class

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,399
and want to go forward you might look

174
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,200
into these programs which I assume will

175
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,320
be live at the time that these videos

176
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,440
are

177
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,480
released I think that this is all that

178
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,680
I'm going to be able to provide

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,360
especially for the open courseware

180
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,680
audience in this class except at the

181
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,279
very end where I have a little message

182
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,519
for you that I recorded at the time

183
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,519
thank you
