00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
How do we learn what we know? That

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,480
includes how to talk, how to walk, how

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,559
to read, how to do math, science,

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,240
history. They were either in your genes

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,840
when you were born or you learned them

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
through the experiences that [music]

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,920
changed who you are. So what do we want

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,685
from learning? We want to know how to

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,359
predict the future on the basis of past

10
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,439
[music] experience. And we also want to

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
imbue the world with meaning. There are

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,400
two kinds of learning that we can think

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,920
about. One is called associative

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,199
learning. Learning where one thing

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
predicts [music] another thing. A

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,480
simpler form of learning is

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
nonassociative learning that simply

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
increases or decreases [music] our

19
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,920
response to something in our

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
environment. So one form of simple

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
nonassociative learning is habituation

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,320
where [music] we reduce our response to

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,000
a repeated environmental stimulus. Let's

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
say you move into an apartment which has

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,120
much more street traffic than [music]

26
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,879
you used to. At first the noises wake

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,640
you up but over time you get used to it

28
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,399
or you habituate to it and you respond

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,840
less to that noise and get a better

30
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
night's sleep.
