00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:20,880
welcome to the 31st Gartner lecture I'm

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,189
Wesley Harris head of the Department of

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,500
aeronautics and Astronautics and I have

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,949
the distinct honor of not only welcome

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,600
you to 31st Gardner lecture but to share

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:38,010
some background as to the naming of this

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,059
distinguished lectureship it is named

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:47,460
after Lester Gardner mr. Gardner was

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:49,590
born in New York City in 1876 and those

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,460
of you who are history buffs realized

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:57,210
that's a same year in which US General

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,629
George Armstrong Custer was killed in

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:05,339
the Battle Little Bighorn but that

16
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:08,490
didn't stop Lester he found his way to

17
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:15,869
MIT and earned his Bachelor of Science

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:18,630
degree here at MIT in 1898 he left MIT

19
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,530
and proceeded to study law at Columbia

20
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,830
University and then he really made his

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,450
switch to technology and became quite

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,430
active in radio broadcasting including

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:36,479
arranging the first demonstration of

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,900
ship-to-shore radio telephone operations

25
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:44,689
with David Sarnoff on the receiving end

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,689
as you know David went on to lead RCA

27
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,320
Lester then made some serious contacts

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,670
with the leadership of aviation in the

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:01,560
u.s. having recently met Glenn Martin in

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:04,500
our own professor Jerome C Hunsaker the

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,399
three of them organized the Gartner

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:12,080
publishing company shortly after the war

33
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,890
the first great war began and Lester

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,240
proceed to the

35
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,150
rank of major including organizing 89

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,730
Aero squadrons that were sent overseas

37
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,730
and he organized these squadrons at

38
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,870
Kelly field and Texas

39
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,990
following the war he became a major

40
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,430
figure in aviation in this country

41
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:36,020
serving as a delegate to several

42
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:40,560
international conferences Rome in 27

43
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:46,230
back in Washington DC and 28 Berlin and

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,989
29 and again Rome in 1938 he then

45
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,470
organized the Institute of aeronautical

46
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:56,580
sciences in 1932 and later with the

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:00,930
American rocket Society IAS became the

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,940
AI double-a mr. Gordon was instrumental

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,330
in creating the huntsacker professorship

50
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:10,160
at MIT he became a honorary fellow of

51
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,650
the Royal Aeronautical Society of London

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,830
he was a fellow of the Institute of the

53
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,640
aeronautical sciences in the US and he

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:24,049
received the Guggenheim medal in 1947

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:35,459
for outstanding achievement in advancing

56
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:38,630
Aeronautics now for the main course it

57
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:44,340
is my distinct honor and pleasure to

58
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:48,090
introduce dr. Harrison Jack Schmitt who

59
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:53,610
will talk to us today on trip to the

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:59,120
moon in the legacy of Apollo Jack is a

61
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:03,239
geologists a pilot an astronaut an

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:07,530
administrator a business person a writer

63
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:13,769
and a former US senator he assured me

64
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:17,940
that he also loves to play squash born

65
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:20,250
in Santa Rita New Mexico he never found

66
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,830
his way to MIT but he did to Caltech

67
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,580
where he earned his Bachelor of Science

68
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,780
degree finally finding the East Coast

69
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:33,920
somewhere in Cambridge

70
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,920
PhD down the road a little bit

71
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,730
Jack is a fellow or honorary fellow in

72
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,930
at least nine technical societies

73
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,240
including the American Institute of

74
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,710
Aeronautics and Astronautics and the

75
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,250
American Astronomical Society he has

76
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:56,610
more than 30 special awards including

77
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,540
honorary degrees I've picked only a few

78
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,400
of them for example Jack received the

79
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:08,070
Republic of Senegal

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,310
National order of the lion in 1973 he is

81

distinguished scholar at Cal Tech in

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:22,140
1973 and he received the GK Gilbert

84
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,180
award bestowed upon him but a planetary

85
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,260
geology division of the Geological

86
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,180
Society of America in 1989

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,990
he was selected as a science astronaut

88
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:39,630
by NASA in 65 he was a lunar module

89
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:43,860
pilot in Apollo 17 which left earth and

90
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:49,590
jewel in December 6 1972 in return on

91
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:54,390
December 19 under his control it landed

92
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:57,630
in the valley of the taurus littrow Jack

93
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:02,070
is the only scientists and the last of

94
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,630
12 humans to step on the moon he

95
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,240
continued his distinguished career of

96
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,210
service having been selected as US

97
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,229
senator from the state of New Mexico of

98
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:16,229
1977 to 82 he is a member of our family

99
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:19,260
and that he serves on the cooperation of

100
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,140
the Draper laboratory he is also a

101
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:26,030
member of the cooperation of audible

102
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,030
sciences Jack

103
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:43,539
well thank you Wes and I guess I did not

104
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:48,009
realize that someone's standing here 31

105
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:51,699
years ago was just preceding flight to

106
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:53,190
the moon which occurred about a little

107
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:57,159
over 30 years ago

108
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,770
and what I'm going to do today to start

109
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:05,379
things off and have a little fun is show

110
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:07,090
you about 10 minute video of most of a

111
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:09,610
trip to the moon it's obviously quite

112
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,560
compressed but I think you'll enjoy it

113
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,900
and then we'll talk a little bit about

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,360
what all of this may mean in various

115
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:21,580
ways to the past as well as to the

116
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,979
future the this video is we put together

117
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,259
for our 30th anniversary celebration at

118
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,259
the Smithsonian Institution last

119
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:31,330
December and if I unfortunately they

120
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:37,050
didn't equip me with a checklist so

121
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:40,120
we'll see what happens there we go

122
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,800
this you'll have to suffer through my

123
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,430
narration and maybe a little sound in

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,500
the background

125
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,810
those were the patches of the various

126
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,440
Apollo missions that did indeed go to

127
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,330
the moon are all emissions and at least

128
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,460
all of them but particularly the later

129
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,550
ones had a great deal of science

130
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,550
training we put in three four or five

131
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,509
days a month of exploration training

132
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:08,110
often using the operating version of a

133
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:09,879
lunar rover but also all the equipment

134
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,800
that we would have so they use of that

135
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,800
equipment became second nature as

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,599
possible and we could better employ what

137
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,009
some people thought was a reason for

138
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:22,319
sending people the moon and that is

139
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:24,729
their minds getting suited up on the

140
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,229
before launch we were scheduled to

141
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:31,509
launch at about 10 o'clock on the 6th we

142
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:35,320
actually had a two hour and 40 minute

143
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:36,969
delay leaving Earth on December 7th here

144
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,850
you see Ron saying goodbye through his

145
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,810
helmet to his wife Jan

146
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:44,610
Jeane trying to hurry us along as usual

147
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,470
I'm bringing up the rear Charlie Buckley

148
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,920
closing the door on us but I had second

149
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,660
thoughts I guess and he wouldn't let me

150
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,390
out maybe I just needed to visit a

151
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,490
restroom somewhere I don't know the

152
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:00,690
launch of Saturn 5 is truly spectacular

153
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,130
at 16 and 6.8 million pounds seven and a

154
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,610
half million pounds of thrust at this

155
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:08,340
point and very very slow acceleration

156
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,700
initially getting to four G's at two

157
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:14,700
minutes and 45 seconds and then staging

158
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,270
and a steady one-and-a-half G's the rest

159
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,460
of the way we had great outstanding

160
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,820
views of the planet Earth throughout our

161
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,980
whole flight to the moon this particular

162
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,760
sequence we may remind you of Apollo 13

163
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,350
the movie where we were docking ron was

164
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,190
knockin with the lunar module so it

165
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,020
would go along with us into to the moon

166
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,750
wouldn't make much sense to go without

167
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,490
it I wouldn't think the although Apollo

168
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,090
8 would disagree with me they had a

169
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:48,060
great time without it landing this pitch

170
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,460
over occurred at 8,000 feet and if you

171
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,600
look very carefully we've got I'm sorry

172
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,240
about the light I hope you have a better

173
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,000
view of this than I do but you see the

174
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,920
shadow of the lunar module up there that

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,890
is in the zero phase Point Sun directly

176
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,570
behind us and if you now you're seeing

177
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:14,340
the shadow get closer to the surface and

178
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,810
we had touchdown streaming away I hope

179
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,510
you can see the streamers there that's

180
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:25,710
the dust great deal of dust in these

181
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,930
lunar in the lunar debris about 60% I'm

182
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,940
gene asked me to come in about 60% is

183
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,260
less than 100 microns gene had asked me

184
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,150
to come over and help him get a drill

185
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,490
core out of the surface

186
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,060
he learned to regret such a request here

187
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,060
as you will see

188
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,610
this was our first excursion we're still

189
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,709
getting used to once again I am still

190
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,810
getting used to one-sixth gravity this

191
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:52,690
is the second discouraging and you and

192
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,449
and the only time in the whole mission

193
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,009
that I did an individual sampling we

194
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:59,529
usually worked as a team as you'll see

195
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:01,569
later and I have already dropped the bag

196
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,089
full of sample so I'm getting that up

197
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:09,100
and leaning back you can see I have done

198
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:12,399
this before I'm quite dirty and I just

199
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:20,529
forgot how to hang on to that sack now

200
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:22,149
I'm getting a little bit upset and about

201
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,100
this point I was informed that the

202
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:28,509
Houston Ballet Society was interested in

203
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:32,110
my services and so I I figured a better

204
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,790
demonstration was appropriate and you'll

205
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,130
see that here in just a moment I finally

206
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,750
got my sack headed for my tool here now

207
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:44,230
this is an actual demonstration of

208
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:47,529
ballet style on the moon now you of

209
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,029
course follow my face again now a much

210
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,860
better way to operate on the moon and

211
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:53,110
you see here at the location where we

212
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,829
found the famous orange soil or orange

213
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:59,889
fire classic glass that was a trench I

214
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,480
had dug right in there working as a team

215
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:04,660
gene always got the sample bag a little

216
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,040
bit too high for me but still that much

217
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,670
more efficient than what you just saw a

218
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,110
few moments ago the this glass is we

219
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,000
will talk about a little bit later has

220
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,240
become a very very important part of the

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,149
Apollo legacy in that it it is calling

222
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,130
into question some of the consensus

223
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:22,660
opinions about the origin of the moon

224
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:27,550
and some other aspects of lunar

225
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:29,649
evolution this was not totally not

226
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,870
totally unexpected discovery here you

227
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,899
see that deposit it's in the rim of a

228
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,569
crater called shorty this is an omen for

229
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,250
photographic control over here and

230
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,860
that's a pretty good color

231
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,600
representation actually a little bit red

232
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,780
it should be a gretter here in the

233
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,810
yellower here but that's about the best

234
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,460
we've been able to do so far down in

235
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,260
Mission Control a variety of people

236
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,630
including Jim Lovell right there we're

237
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,280
watching over our shoulder we never gave

238
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,660
him a chance to tell us to do much but

239
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:04,030
nevertheless they felt good about we

240
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:05,770
knew gene had a certain technique as did

241
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,220
most of the pilot astronauts I don't it

242
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,050
must be a genetic - ha they'd like to

243
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,840
hop across the surface they call this

244
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:19,030
their bunnyhop as you can see even it is

245
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,760
not too successful sometimes and in a

246
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,160
few moments you'll see how really it is

247
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,540
to work across the lunar surface the

248
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,630
best way to do it but that'll be a

249
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,370
moment or two now this cameras on me

250
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,140
taking a pan if you look carefully

251
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,910
there's my face it's one of the few

252
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,820
faces if they don't laugh the only face

253
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,440
to be photographed on the moon because I

254
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,600
kept my visor up being a good geologist

255
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,490
I wanted to make sure I saw the rocks as

256
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,530
clearly as possible and so the

257
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,920
gold-plated visor spent part of its time

258
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:51,600
up now this is a little skiing

259
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,600
demonstration little parallel skiing

260
00:13:51,870 --> 00:14:04,150
not too good as you can see catch an

261
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:05,830
edge everyone as well now more more

262
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,080
appropriately for moving across the moon

263
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,880
is a is using a cross-country skiing

264
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,860
technique and here you see that

265
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,110
technique applied gliding above the

266
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,270
surface running through a boulder field

267
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,290
this was on a third excursion and you

268
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,780
can see we had a great deal of

269
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,090
confidence by this time to go running

270
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,000
like this and really that ultimately I

271
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,790
think will be the mode of transportation

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,290
of choice you can over a reasonably

273
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,700
level surface you can probably get up to

274
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,290
ten or fifteen kilometers an hour that

275
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,170
way without expenditure of much effort

276
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,450
the parts are from the moon not a really

277
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,650
good photograph gene tried to persuade

278
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,650
me to go outside and get one

279
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,720
about a half a G acceleration and we're

280
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,970
off the camera head mounted in my window

281
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,070
looking down now at the surface

282
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,769
there's the decent stage our launch

283
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:57,190
platform our tracks going back and forth

284
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:59,970
to an antenna I laid out here and to the

285
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:03,160
outside Ron Evans now taking these

286
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,959
pictures as we approach rendezvous we

287
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,450
had a very rapid rendezvous is what was

288
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,470
called direct ascent ron abboud ron mout

289
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:13,300
going outside for his spacewalk actually

290
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,829
space swim is a more appropriate term

291
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,760
because you really do pull yourself

292
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:24,240
along and don't use your legs at all of

293
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:27,220
course hi mom isn't is is required and

294
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,709
this was about an hour long spacewalk

295
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,410
that he had that to gather canisters a

296
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:34,589
film that had been exposed during his

297
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,640
three days of orbiting operations

298
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:39,310
independent of our activities on the

299
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,510
surface I was here in the hatch helping

300
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,700
to keep trying to keep him from getting

301
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:46,149
tangled up in that umbilical which you

302
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,829
can see has a life of its own he would

303
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,180
hand me the canister I'd stick it down

304
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,490
and hope the gene could keep it from

305
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,950
flying out into space so we were

306
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,959
reasonably successful with that three

307
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,680
days after we left the moon we entered

308
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:01,270
the atmosphere at 35,000 miles an hour

309
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,060
pulled about seven GS to make sure we

310
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,829
were captured and then flew our way down

311
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,570
to where the carrier was waiting for us

312
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,760
maybe actually parked there carrier's

313
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,829
about five miles away from our planned

314
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,709
impact point afraid that we might land

315
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:17,980
on their carrier I thought that was not

316
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:20,800
very nice the but splashdown of the

317
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,410
final Apollo mission and certainly the

318
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,839
most recent flight to the moon you see

319
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,270
here as photographs taken from a

320
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,320
helicopter that almost immediately

321
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:35,079
deployed maybe seals who then put a

322
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,320
floatation collar around the spacecraft

323
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,760
as a safety precaution and here I think

324
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,350
this may be Gene Cernan

325
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:46,240
the last to leave the ship actually I

326
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,430
think gene left first that was sort of a

327
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,230
non Navy tradition now I hope you caught

328
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,200
quickly gene and I both graphs the

329
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,320
railings of the of the steps there

330
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,060
because you really do have some trouble

331
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,920
balancing Ron wanting all over the red

332
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:05,199
carpet there is the Apollo Heritage is

333
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,380
really quite remarkable I think history

334
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,430
will be very kind to to it for what not

335
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:15,360
only was done but what was learned the

336
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:18,459
maybe one of the most important parts of

337
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,829
what we left at least at our site was a

338
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,930
map of where all the Paulo landing sites

339
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:27,730
are that was something I insisted that

340
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:29,980
we have on that plaque and then also the

341
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,100
legacy of having this view here in a

342
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,160
moment of our planet Earth from 34,000

343
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,930
miles away on our way out to the moon

344
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,700
really a remarkable photograph still the

345
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,420
most requested photograph from the NASA

346
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:50,710
archives and with that I'll see if I can

347
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:52,030
turn this off did that work now I see if

348
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,540
we I may have destroyed the whole

349
00:17:52,030 --> 00:18:02,550
process here of getting the PowerPoint

350
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:02,550
presentation up there we go

351
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
the legacy of Apollo comes in many this

352
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,100
is a little more serious part of the

353
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:18,430
discussion hopefully not not too serious

354
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:22,330
it comes in many aspects certainly it

355
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:25,120
was born of the Cold War the and the

356
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,800
political goals of both Eisenhower and

357
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:33,040
Kennedy were met by it in its ultimate

358
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,710
form I include Eisenhower here not

359
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,510
because he provided the main impetus to

360
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,820
apollo kennedy certainly did that

361
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,620
but if eisenhower hadn't insisted

362
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,360
personally on the development of the

363
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,390
saturn v launch vehicle and associated

364
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,070
engines it wouldn't have happened and so

365
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,290
he does deserve maybe a little more

366
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,200
credit for this and then he has gotten

367
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,820
normally in the in the history books

368
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,980
there really is a dichotomy in what

369
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,960
Eisenhower apparently felt about put

370
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,480
said publicly about putting men into

371
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,840
space and certainly to the moon and what

372
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,029
he did to ensure that we had

373
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,190
a heavy-lift launch vehicle which had no

374
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:11,080
other purpose but to put men yeah and

375
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,029
the vicinity of the moon so I'll let you

376
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,259
figure out exactly what was on his mind

377
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:19,980
in doing that and the leadership of the

378
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:22,090
Soviet Union I think was clearly

379
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,159
intimidated enough so that Reagan's

380
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,249
Strategic Defense Initiative later

381
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,860
became credible literally America could

382
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:32,860
succeed where the Soviets apparently

383
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,110
could not in such an endeavour us pride

384
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,360
and confidence was enhanced in a time

385
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,360
when as you recall a missile gap and and

386
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,549
other things were creating a bit of

387
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,610
unease in the United States among its

388
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:47,919
people and as I travel the world through

389
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:52,419
many years later I found that there was

390
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,889
a a promise at least to other peoples of

391
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:56,830
the world that their future could be

392
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:58,210
better than it than their past I'm not

393
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,139
sure we've fully lived up to that

394
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:04,690
promise as yet but still it is there now

395
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:07,149
the cultural legacy is is somewhat

396
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,210
interesting as well the power created a

397
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:12,730
new evolutionary status for humankind in

398
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,440
the universe there was a rapid

399
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,169
improvement in the human condition on

400
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,220
earth due the acceleration of

401
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,629
technological expansion again it

402
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,809
probably would have happened but

403
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:23,860
certainly much more slowly than it did

404
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:25,539
future terrestrial energy and

405
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,909
environmental improvement is now

406
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,789
possible both with the increase in

407
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:33,720
conversion efficiencies of of ordinary

408
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:36,820
energy sources and with the new

409
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,889
potential of lunar helium-3 fusion that

410
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,129
we'll talk about a little bit more in a

411
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:44,409
few moments and indeed on the moon at

412
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:47,619
least we've identified clearly space

413
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:50,590
settlement resources hydrogen oxygen and

414
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:52,539
water and then ultimately I think food

415
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,429
as well for space settlements there are

416
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,649
not resources that would have a value

417
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:00,100
here on earth but certainly would have

418
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:04,659
value to future inhabitants of space the

419
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,999
keys to the success of Apollo comes in

420
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:08,590
many different forms and you have to

421
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,350
think of these as the kinds of things

422
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,119
that have to be in place if we are going

423
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,669
to do these kinds of things in deep

424
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,039
space our take on major significant

425
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:18,550
projects anywhere a sufficient base of

426
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,760
technology

427
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,590
she certainly came from the World War to

428
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
the Cold War and the decisions that

429
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,360
Eisenhower made during his administer

430
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,610
second administration there was a

431
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:34,620
reservoir of young engineers and skilled

432
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:39,490
workers that the 1957 launch of Sputnik

433
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:41,230
generated the pervasive environment of

434
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:42,970
national unease some of you are old

435
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,900
enough to remember that that did exist

436
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:49,210
particularly in the campaign of 1960

437
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:52,260
there was a catalytic event of course

438
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:56,080
that brings the focus to the effort that

439
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,960
was presage by the the Sputnik launch

440
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,060
but the the one event that really began

441
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,490
to focus the attention of the Kennedy

442
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:09,070
White House was Greg Aaron's flight in

443
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:11,320
April of 1961 and we had at that at that

444
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,680
time an articulate and trusted in

445
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,210
persuasive president who actually had

446
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,860
been thinking about this and was

447
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,740
preparing himself for this well before

448
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,350
Gagarin's flight that is at least weeks

449
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,810
before in some of the decisions he made

450
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:30,940
on the budget cycle in discussions with

451
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:33,880
Jim Webb the and and we after Apollo the

452
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,360
Apollo 204 fire at least we put together

453
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,470
a competent and disciplined management

454
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,660
management was moving along quite well

455
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,600
up to that point but still not at the

456
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:47,740
point and level necessary for operations

457
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,300
in deep space again I would submit to

458
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,890
you that when you ought work in deep

459
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,190
space at least for the foreseeable

460
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,500
future most if not all of these

461
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:01,570
conditions are going to be required now

462
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,690
because of its currency let me just

463
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,520
digress slightly here relative to NASA's

464
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,180
worst accidents and there are I think

465
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,500
some common threads the Pala tool for

466
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,430
fire the Challenger and Columbia

467
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,400
accidents really began with the

468
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:20,770
acceptance of abnormal as normal we also

469
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,870
at the time had a lack of a technically

470
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,430
experienced administrator whether that's

471
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,510
significant or not I'll let you decide

472
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:30,220
but all three have that common thread

473
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,870
the lack of a top-level managerial and

474
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,140
operational oversight take

475
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,970
place was not happening under Webb it

476
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,980
was and it was not happening in the case

477
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,720
of the other two and a lack of a

478
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,640
mechanism for appeal in the chain of

479
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,350
command of management I'll tell you one

480
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,440
thing about Apollo there was always a

481
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,580
way to get a good idea moved up that

482
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,470
stopped pretty much at the end of Apollo

483
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,990
good ideas did not move easily through

484
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,910
the system I had many experiences my own

485
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:02,890
I saw many others were engineers

486
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,020
astronauts scientists at any level if

487
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,880
they had a good idea and could in that

488
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,710
idea would stand the test of discussions

489
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,800
with their colleagues that would move up

490
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,300
and through the chain of management very

491
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,630
very important to have that in these

492
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:20,230
kinds of very complex opera programs and

493
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:21,880
projects now only with Apollo 13 do I

494
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,710
think you can see a pure set of

495
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,690
accidents and design flaws that can be

496
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:29,970
blamed where we just did not anticipate

497
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:32,380
in the design and in the operation a

498
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,120
number of things that could go wrong all

499
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,510
at once and that really is the

500
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,760
background of the Apollo 13 accident and

501
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,040
one of the reasons why it was it was

502
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,660
fixed reasonably quickly and we got back

503
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:48,400
to flight quite quite quickly as well

504
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:52,900
now let's talk more in more detail about

505
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,610
the scientific legacy a first-order

506
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,530
understanding of the origin evolution of

507
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:01,679
the Moon clearly has as resulted from

508
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:04,900
Apollo and and of course the the later

509
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,510
unmanned programs such as Clementine and

510
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:13,270
lunar prospector with a nice assist from

511
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:15,190
Galileo as well may it rest in peace we

512
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,840
had developed a basis for the

513
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,410
interpretation of those of that post

514
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,400
Apollo information about the moon by the

515
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,980
analysis of the lunar samples from

516
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,920
Apollo and it that in turn became the

517
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,270
foundation for comparative planetology

518
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,130
comparative planetology really didn't

519
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,410
wasn't much there were a few people like

520
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,360
Piper and shoemaker around who

521
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,850
considered themselves I think Planet

522
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,190
ologists but the as a discipline it was

523
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,470
just was not active very quickly with

524
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,570
Apollo and even before Apollo but in

525
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:45,159
anticipation of it comparative

526
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:50,320
planetology became an important

527
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:53,229
discipline there is recorded on the moon

528
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,929
a record of the history of the inner

529
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:57,429
solar system and it is a guide to the

530
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:00,479
early history of the earth and Mars and

531
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:03,039
that is particularly a record of the

532
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:05,859
impact Commentary asteroid impact

533
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,769
history of the inner solar system we

534
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:10,989
also have delineated a lunar resource

535
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,539
potential not only for use here on earth

536
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:16,090
but also clearly a potential for use in

537
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:17,619
space and not just on the moon but

538
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,899
elsewhere and that's not too shabby a

539
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:22,080
legacy scientifically in spite of what

540
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:26,499
some of my scientific colleagues might

541
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,809
try to paint now the major just to give

542
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:31,720
you an idea of what we have learned

543
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:33,879
about lunar evolution and this just

544
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,700
remember this chart really could not

545
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:38,470
have been created without Apollo we

546
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,989
certainly have learned a great about the

547
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,759
beginning the age of the Moon is roughly

548
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:44,710
that of the age of the solar system not

549
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,179
exactly and it's in that not exactly

550
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:49,269
that things really are starting to get

551
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:51,159
exciting there is a debate and then most

552
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:54,279
of the debates I have now here in red

553
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,749
whether Earth impact or capture has

554
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:59,320
resulted in the origin of the Earth's

555
00:26:55,749 --> 00:27:01,059
moon the consensus 95% or more of the

556
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,789
people in my community of planet

557
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,529
ologists would say earth impact that is

558
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:08,229
the impact of a mars-sized asteroid

559
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:10,330
resulted in the origin of the moon I'm

560
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:12,099
not one of those that agree with that I

561
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,129
think there's some major problems when

562
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:17,019
we'll talk about that in a moment one

563
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:19,149
new concept that came out of Apollo uh

564
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:22,570
very very soon after the Apollo 11

565
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:25,119
samples were analyzed both John wood at

566
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:29,440
the Smithsonian Observatory here and

567
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:31,989
also others immediately realized that

568
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,119
the moon had differentiated that is

569
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:37,629
there had been a magma ocean that had

570
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,489
crystallized in sequence and had

571
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:42,039
resulted in a chemical differentiation

572
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:44,559
of the elements in the crust of the Moon

573
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:48,039
are in the upper mantle of the moon down

574
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,139
to at least 500 kilometers that magma

575
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:52,809
ocean was a new concept that is now

576
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:54,519
being considered as a viable concept on

577
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:56,400
all of the terrestrial planets for this

578
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:00,210
period of time

579
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,790
there was a residue from that magma

580
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,670
ocean that has become unfortunately now

581
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,320
it's called your creep creep is

582
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,560
potassium rare earth elements in

583
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,350
phosphorus rich material your means the

584
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,510
original creep because we'll all we see

585
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,890
at the surface of the Moon is creep

586
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,350
that's not original it's just the

587
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:23,430
signature of it I'm sure that excites

588
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:25,710
you very much then there comes this

589
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:29,610
important crater in history that we now

590
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:32,700
have and and in that may be one of the

591
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:35,730
most important aspects is the definition

592
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,620
now on the moon of continental scale

593
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,240
basins that I'm talking about basins

594
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,520
that are two hundred two thousand

595
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,990
kilometers in diameter or more and these

596
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,000
are basins that formed on the moon and

597
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,740
almost certainly formed on earth as a

598
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,440
result of the impact of extraordinary

599
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,210
energetic objects from space there were

600
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,760
there are many other basins and large

601
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,470
basins there's something like 45 or 50

602
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,620
of these large basins which are greater

603
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:03,300
than 300 kilometers in diameter some the

604
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,410
oldest of these have apparently resulted

605
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,990
in the crust of the Moon being

606
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,030
strengthened as this as the liquid that

607
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,010
we called the residual liquid from the

608
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,050
magma ocean the the so-called creep

609
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:16,380
moved up to the basin and solidified

610
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:19,500
because the last 14 or so of these large

611
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,260
basins have mass concentrations in them

612
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,180
which have been supported now for almost

613
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,980
four billion years so the crust has to

614
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,160
be extraordinarily strong for that to

615
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:32,460
have occurred coincidentally a it also

616
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,460
appears that during that period of Young

617
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,650
Basin formation the core of the Moon was

618
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,890
active and we actually have evidence now

619
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:43,650
andrás it of remanent magnetism on the

620
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:47,040
far side of the Moon at the Antipodes of

621
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:50,250
these young large basins that presumably

622
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,950
indicate that a circulating core dynamo

623
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,720
was present during this very brief

624
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,630
period of time maybe no longer than 100

625
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,550
million years now there is this is

626
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,950
another area of great controversy within

627
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,900
our community is whether or not that

628
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,400
period that I indicated there may be

629
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,550
four or five hundred million years of

630
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,600
cratering didn't happen all at once and

631
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,880
that is one of the

632
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,400
primary rationales for the proposals to

633
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,350
go to this to the far side of the moon

634
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,230
to the center near the center of the

635
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:22,530
South Pole akin basin that is a basin

636
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,270
2500 kilometers in diameter to see if we

637
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,700
can't resolve some of these questions

638
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,740
about whether you had about a hundred

639
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,470
million years of intense impact activity

640
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,080
on the moon about 3.9 billion years ago

641
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,250
or whether it's extended over four or

642
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,090
five hundred million years

643
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:42,090
either way the these large basins do

644
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,790
represent a new source of debris in the

645
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,580
solar system entering the inner solar

646
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:49,530
system that we really hadn't been

647
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,380
contemplated before we generally have

648
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:54,810
thought of some kind of continuum of

649
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,670
impact activity and in the near inner

650
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,610
solar system dying off gradually with

651
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,770
time here it appears that particularly

652
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,660
if it is a single cataclysm of a hundred

653
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,460
million years duration something

654
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,410
happened in the outer solar system to

655
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,860
begin to send objects into the inner

656
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:12,630
solar system a much more frequently

657
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,970
large objects much more frequently than

658
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:20,250
it happened before one of the very

659
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:22,110
intriguing possibility now during this

660
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,330
cratering period there appears to have

661
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,700
been significant deep igneous activity

662
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,250
and the moon probably the result of

663
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,620
pressure release due to these large

664
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,290
impacts on material that was almost at

665
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,590
the melting point anyway and that and

666
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:40,100
those so-called mgmg sweet magma has

667
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,810
moved up into the crust I'm not going to

668
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,670
spend a lot of time on that the next

669
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,530
major episode was a formation of

670
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,690
basaltic Marya those dark parts of the

671
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,070
Moon that formed the image of the man in

672
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,900
the moon or the rabbit in the moon or

673
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,630
whatever character you happen to see on

674
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:59,280
any particular evening and depending on

675
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:01,230
what you were doing early in that period

676
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,940
the so called crypto Marya have been

677
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,150
identified these are covered by the

678
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,650
ejecta from the young large basin so

679
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,860
that's why they're called crypto we only

680
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,570
see hints of them because of other amol

681
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:16,410
impact craters that have exposed them

682
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:19,680
the main Marya episode was between about

683
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,820
3.8 and 3 billion years ago then it

684
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,899
began to die off gradually with time

685
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,609
until the the using crater counts

686
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:29,759
estimates of age do using crater counts

687
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:32,039
greater frequency size frequency counts

688
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,479
we think that there may have been

689
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:39,239
igneous activity in one part of the moon

690
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:41,769
as as little as 1 billion years ago but

691
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:43,919
realize that almost everything that I'm

692
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:47,289
talking about here on the moon is

693
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,999
happened a long time ago and it gives us

694
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:52,119
a window into the early history of the

695
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:55,629
earth now I'm not going to go into this

696
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:57,700
other than to show you this diagram to

697
00:32:55,629 --> 00:33:00,099
indicate that if you just look at the

698
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,649
first 50 60 70 billion years a million

699
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:04,779
years million years of the history of

700
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:07,690
the solar system we are learning a great

701
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:10,720
deal about what was going on and not a

702
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:13,119
small part of that as a result of what

703
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,879
we have learned of the Moon in

704
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,769
particular the Apollo legacy extends to

705
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:20,739
the issue of planet esmolol

706
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:22,299
a grinning the inner solar system on

707
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:25,090
through the development of these magma

708
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:30,099
oceans proto cores of the terrestrial

709
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:32,139
planets and then also the issue of down

710
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:34,090
at the bottom here of when did the cores

711
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:36,849
of the various terrestrial planet

712
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:40,389
actually aggregate we know a lot about

713
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:42,399
when core forming materials separated in

714
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:44,619
the terrestrial planets but that I

715
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,460
submit is a separate issue of when you

716
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:51,849
actually formed a core and we actually

717
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,979
using the the reason we can we can get

718
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:56,349
into all of these kinds of issues now is

719
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:58,539
because of the identification a few

720
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:00,820
decades ago of what are called extinct

721
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:02,320
isotopes these are isotopes that have

722
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,259
very very short I half-life's

723
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,210
decay to a definitive daughter product

724
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:08,889
that you can now measure you don't see

725
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,629
the isotopes anymore but you see the

726
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:12,520
daughter product aluminum-26

727
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:15,010
is one of the more important ones about

728
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,720
a nine million year half-life excuse me

729
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,770
about a seven seven hundred twenty-eight

730
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,770
thousand year half-life

731
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:24,819
hafnium 182 is another one that has the

732
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,440
nine million year half-life this is one

733
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:28,539
of those identification of those

734
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,470
isotopes and the ability of mass

735
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:35,339
spectrometry to measure extremely small

736
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:37,929
amounts of materials literally atoms is

737
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:40,149
giving us this kind of an opportunity

738
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,629
now to understand the formation of a

739
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:45,220
solar system around a sun-like star

740
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:47,919
really really exciting time for people

741
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:51,339
who are in this field now let's go back

742
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:54,849
to this business about giant impact it's

743
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:57,490
a very attractive hypothesis in that it

744
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:58,930
explains one thing very well and that is

745
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,510
the high angular momentum of the

746
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:04,240
earth-moon system however it can't

747
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,010
explain in my estimation the geology and

748
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,890
composition of the lower mantle of the

749
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,079
moon the challenges that it has is that

750
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,450
we are seeing increasingly particularly

751
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:16,119
in the analysis of the orange glass that

752
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,970
I showed you in the video and a green

753
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:23,529
glass that was belatedly identified in

754
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:26,619
the Apollo of 15 sample suite in those

755
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:28,779
we are seen evidence that the lower

756
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:30,730
mantle the moon that is the that is the

757
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:34,150
part of the moon below about 500

758
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:36,640
kilometers has never melted in its

759
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,099
entirety never differentiated that is

760
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,299
crystallized separate crystals minerals

761
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:46,390
and it has chondritic signatures in it

762
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:50,349
particularly for tungsten for lead and

763
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:52,059
in a very high volatile content relative

764
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,640
to anything that we see at the surface

765
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:56,950
of the Moon the seismic evidence and

766
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,690
trace element data and suggests that you

767
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,010
have increased alumina as a result of

768
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,099
the lack of differentiation

769
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,750
garnett present before below 500

770
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,950
kilometers I see Jim Thompson in the

771
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,450
audience you'll know that I'm always

772
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,240
interested in finding garnet somewhere

773
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:15,250
having done my thesis and related kinds

774
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:18,849
of rocks and so there this these kinds

775
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:20,740
of issues are ones which so far the

776
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:24,430
proponents of the giant impact theory

777
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:26,710
have not have not been able to to deal

778
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,410
with they are trying and by increasingly

779
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,720
complex models but I think that when the

780
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,590
final result is in when we finally know

781
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,990
more than we know

782
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,550
right now that will find that the

783
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,820
capture of an independent co-orbiting

784
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,890
small planet seriously needs

785
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,140
reconsideration that does have some

786
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,550
problems at least based on the little

787
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,770
bit of modeling that's been done to date

788
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,930
what is really needed in this question

789
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,460
is for some very very bright graduate

790
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,680
student hopefully one in this audience

791
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,090
who will undertake to begin to model

792
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,760
capture now in a much more systematic

793
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,590
way than it's ever been done and and at

794
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,090
least become competitive with a level of

795
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:05,170
computer modeling that's done for the

796
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:07,420
capture hypothesis now I do think though

797
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:09,370
that this issue of the very large basins

798
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:13,090
is one of very great importance to a

799
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:15,340
terrestrial geologist right now and

800
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,830
we'll get in why in just a moment these

801
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:22,360
are some of the basins that are that are

802
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:23,830
are some are non-controversial the South

803
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,750
Pole Aiken basin which you don't see

804
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:29,380
well in this picture but is right in

805
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:31,600
this area is is attested to by by all

806
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,720
workers in the field the Procol Harum

807
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,240
basin Don Wilhelm's and I and a few

808
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,010
others think is an enlarger basin that

809
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,160
has been seriously modified by other

810
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,140
impacts there's a hint of this prospect

811
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,050
what I call the prospector basin in some

812
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,360
of the data from prospector the same for

813
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:51,970
Clementine Basin here and maybe a

814
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,580
cryptic far side small topographic

815
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,290
anomaly there the statistical analysis

816
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,630
of the frequency of these large basins

817
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,680
for a body the size of the moon

818
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:02,290
suggested to Don Wilhelm's that we

819
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,570
should have seen about 14 of these

820
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:06,430
we I've only shown you the possibility

821
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:08,680
of five here and and those kind of

822
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:12,550
analyses are always subject to some

823
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,500
debate but nevertheless however many

824
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:17,260
there are they almost certainly occurred

825
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,510
on earth as well and and here you see a

826
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,280
topographic representation of those

827
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,440
basins and a South Pole Aiken becomes

828
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,050
much more obvious as a immense

829
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,880
topographic low the lowest point here is

830
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,120
12 kilometers below the mean lunar

831
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,400
radius it really is one heck of a hole

832
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,770
for the moon even poke alarum shows a

833
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:44,200
general topographic low there as well

834
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:46,070
now the these large basins may well

835
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,430
relate some of you in the audience

836
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,260
we'll know that people in our field talk

837
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,240
about the creep hop spot that's a

838
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,790
concentration of this potassium rare

839
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,120
earth element phosphorus material in in

840
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,410
the on the front side of the moon that

841
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,020
may well have been caused by the

842
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,360
migration of the residual liquid to a

843
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:07,070
low-pressure area we've already talked

844
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,610
about a little bit about the mimsy sweet

845
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,830
soo pressure release melting and and and

846
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,710
also there's an issue of a knellman ight

847
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:18,080
that's an iron titanium oxide rich

848
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,820
cumulate that may have overturned under

849
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,190
the Procol Harum event to give you these

850
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,470
young mario i mentioned that are about a

851
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,920
billion years old that are also titanium

852
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:29,990
rich those are fairly detailed issues

853
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,580
that we don't need to go into today

854
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,040
unless there's some additional interest

855
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:38,840
in it the more importantly are these

856
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:40,550
little continental scale basins my

857
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,800
estimation is that they were forming on

858
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:45,530
the moon and all the terrestrial planets

859
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,350
between about four point two and 4.5

860
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,360
billion years ago one of the more

861
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,240
interesting aspects of that is that just

862
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,100
recently in the last two or three years

863
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,910
we have workers have been able to

864
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:01,960
identify 4.4 billion year old

865
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:05,960
terrestrial zircons zircons are very

866
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,960
stable hard minerals that seem to last

867
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,520
forever under proper circumstances and

868
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,470
in some of the oldest settlements on

869
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,530
earth we are finding to tribal zircons

870
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:19,340
that is sedimentary zircons the cores of

871
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:22,010
which show ages of this kind in the 4.4

872
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,690
4.3 billion year old that's again shows

873
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,940
you what mass spectrometry is able to do

874
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:29,030
these days on a single crystal of zircon

875
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,580
give you an age of this nature but the

876
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:33,020
thing is where do they come from and

877
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,970
certainly it's in the same time frame as

878
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,620
at least my estimates and I think

879
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:39,320
Wilhelm's estimates for the ages of

880
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:41,540
these large basins zircon is a product

881
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,370
of late-stage magma differentiation here

882
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:48,320
on earth we it's a very familiar mineral

883
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:50,360
to us water would increase that the

884
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,460
amount of impression Olymp act melt

885
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,170
volume from one of these large impacts

886
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,810
and a differentiation of that impact

887
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,599
melt may well have resulted in these

888
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:01,509
zircons and

889
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:04,299
in fact they're the oxygen isotopes of

890
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:06,430
the zircons are consistent with water in

891
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:08,019
the magma from which they form so I

892
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,359
think we're beginning to bring that

893
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:12,549
those two stories together slowly and

894
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:14,079
it's a very exciting story indeed

895
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:16,239
because it begins to create

896
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,829
extraordinary diversity in the Earth's

897
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,249
crust right almost from the very

898
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:25,210
beginning of Earth history and of course

899
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:26,859
begins to even relate in some indirect

900
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,729
ways to the questions of the origin of

901
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:32,559
life now the old large basins in general

902
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:34,239
the ones greater than 300 kilometers in

903
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,989
diameter we've talked about them a

904
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,670
little bit the Apollo 11 site is in one

905
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:42,849
of them that's Mari tranquilo taught us

906
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:46,119
down here the ceramic Tata station which

907
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:48,700
is a young large basin Apollo 17 landed

908
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:51,849
right there it's here this is another

909
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,859
this is Facundo taught us another old

910
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:56,410
large basin not nearly as distinct as

911
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:58,019
these younger ones that that these all

912
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,819
have masks on send them these do not

913
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:03,190
they do have a ma refill but not as

914
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:09,339
thick in the old large basins as as you

915
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:12,369
would expect now the issues here we I'm

916
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:14,499
not going to to spend your time on these

917
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:16,450
these are again issues that will be of

918
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:18,700
interest to some in the audience but I'm

919
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,589
sure not all I had to do with the

920
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:24,039
strengthening of the crust as a result

921
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:25,900
of these young the old or old basins we

922
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:30,219
talked about the Cataclysm and I'm not

923
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:33,160
going to dwell on that further but we

924
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:35,319
might talk about why I think the

925
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,049
Cataclysm is an artifact it's an

926
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:41,410
artifact of these late young impacts you

927
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:43,799
had some 14 of these which distributed

928
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,479
ejecta throughout almost all the Moon

929
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:48,219
caused a great deal of resurfacing and I

930
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:51,489
have a feeling that that's what most of

931
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:54,729
the evidence of this so-called Cataclysm

932
00:42:51,489 --> 00:43:00,190
is telling us we will have to wait and

933
00:42:54,729 --> 00:43:03,549
see there are other some other ages at

934
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:07,989
Apollo 16 Paolo 17 cites that suggests

935
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:09,759
that older impacts did indeed occur the

936
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:12,040
I mentioned the global effects of the

937
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:14,770
young large basins on this age

938
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,690
for the Cataclysm there is a jet to

939
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,180
covering the crypto Mario which is

940
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:22,420
global no question the ejecta from those

941
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:24,210
lighter impacts was global and there are

942
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:28,300
a few of those samples as I mentioned

943
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:31,330
now I do want to though emphasize the

944
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:33,460
importance in the studies of the history

945
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:35,140
of the solar system to begin to think

946
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,760
about what the source of these impactors

947
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:41,650
were whether it was 100 million years or

948
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:44,140
400 million years I see the PC now is is

949
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:48,520
reacting to my Mac generated PowerPoint

950
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,830
by spelling out every sentence there's

951
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:55,360
certainly some new accretionary

952
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:59,230
reservoir appeared masoor s-- is to

953
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:02,410
consider would be the Oort cloud which

954
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:04,840
but through an interaction of a passer

955
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,960
steady stellar body or cloud being the

956
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,660
long potential source of long period

957
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,190
comets of course nobody has ever seen an

958
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,500
object in the Oort cloud but it has

959
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:18,240
pretty well established itself as a

960
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,670
article of faith that it's out there

961
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,460
more maybe more important to look at is

962
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:27,700
the prototype for belt interaction with

963
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:29,590
the large of the large commentary

964
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,060
objects we have out there some 800 now

965
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,620
I've been identified there are more than

966
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:35,500
a hundred kilometers in diameter I think

967
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:37,900
so we know they're out there but as the

968
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:41,770
gas giants evolved in their orbits they

969
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:43,540
would influence the the orbits of those

970
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:45,070
commentary objects and may well have

971
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,390
caused them to be injected into this

972
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:51,220
inner solar system main belt asteroids

973
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,990
Jupiter interaction with the

974
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,940
planetesimals that formed in the

975
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,700
asteroid belt and the expulsion of the

976
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:00,820
fragments from that belt may well be

977
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:03,130
another source or some combination of at

978
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,640
least two and three and maybe even all

979
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:10,600
of these the now the implications of

980
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,570
intense cratering on the earth and mars

981
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,130
i think are quite important to consider

982
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:18,580
that's it this is what the far side

983
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,440
cratered Highlands look like we have the

984
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,060
southern uplands of the moon so much the

985
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,360
same character this just happens to be a

986
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:27,310
picture of the far side highlands it

987
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,050
they're saturated with crater 60 to 70

988
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,000
kilometers in diameter saturate

989
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,950
mathematically saturated with craters of

990
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,750
that size so you can imagine the level

991
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,300
of violence that was taking place

992
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:40,150
it created a mega regolith some 25

993
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,970
kilometers thick it's well mixed on the

994
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:47,050
scale of hundreds of kilometers and with

995
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:50,050
a significant implantation of solar wind

996
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:52,930
hydrogen in the in in that material

997
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,760
I suspect that be in a hydrous

998
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,290
environment planet with a hydrous

999
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,240
environment such as the earth and mars

1000
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,600
that clay minerals with a dominant

1001
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,540
mineral species at this time because

1002
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,760
that's what happens to minerals that you

1003
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:09,190
grind up vitrify and put in a water

1004
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,510
environment they turn to clay and I

1005
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,300
think it's important that we think more

1006
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,760
about just what it means to have that

1007
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,140
kind of a mineral as your dominant

1008
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,750
mineral species at the surface of the

1009
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:24,460
earth and indeed of Mars the

1010
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:27,190
implications of all of this may have a

1011
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:31,330
great deal to do with life certainly a

1012
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:33,970
general impact in by intense impact bar

1013
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:37,540
environment from 4.5 to 4.2 billion

1014
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:39,840
years we had clays and possibly sulfides

1015
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,190
in various environments there were

1016
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,740
dominant in hydrous environments up to

1017
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:46,840
3.8 billion years 3.8 billion years is

1018
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:50,080
the end of the major cratering period in

1019
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,950
the inner solar system global soup for

1020
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:56,350
organic synthesis as a result of this

1021
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:59,200
the clearly there must have been organic

1022
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:02,590
molecular synthesis on earth prior to

1023
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,350
3.8 billion years mineral catalysts I

1024
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:10,180
believe were very probably involved in

1025
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:12,280
this synthesis and but large basin

1026
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:14,560
formation up to 3.8 billion years

1027
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,500
prevented any systematic development of

1028
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,630
replicating life forms it wasn't until a

1029
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,460
large Basin ceases to form that we start

1030
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,890
to see evidence of replicating life

1031
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:27,070
forms on earth and that is just almost

1032
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:30,610
exactly within those limits right at

1033
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:34,090
about 3.8 billion years fossils at 3.5

1034
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:38,620
but evidence isotopic evidence of life

1035
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:41,890
processes taking a underway

1036
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,630
at about 3.8 billion years so I don't

1037
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,060
believe that is coincidence the end of

1038
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,710
the large basin formation suddenly

1039
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,270
allowed replicating life-forms to

1040
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,610
actually take hold they may have taken

1041
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:55,750
hold before but but may also have been

1042
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:56,890
wiped out the geochemical heterogeneity

1043
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,080
in the earth crust we've already

1044
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:02,290
mentioned the zircons I think show that

1045
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,410
now at 4.4 billion years an important

1046
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:08,260
part of this whole picture clearly

1047
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:10,480
global hostility to life prior to 3.8

1048
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:14,050
billion years but a continuous

1049
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:17,950
compatibility for life after 3.8 billion

1050
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:20,830
years yes there were certain points

1051
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:23,620
where the species of the earth took a

1052
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:25,870
beating and it certain points in

1053
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:28,540
geologic time after that but I doubt if

1054
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,310
it would have been possible for anything

1055
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,500
happening in the solar system to have

1056
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,660
wiped out life on Earth after 3.8

1057
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:38,110
billion years now let's talk a little

1058
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:42,010
bit finally about this access to our

1059
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:44,380
lunar resources it's it's not a pure

1060
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:46,150
science issue but it does relate to one

1061
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,430
of those more serious problems affecting

1062
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,650
the world today and that is we're going

1063
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:59,470
to have something like 10 billion

1064
00:48:50,650 --> 00:49:00,850
Earthlings by 2050 excuse me let you

1065
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:06,220
think about the implications of that

1066
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:09,960
number it may even be larger that

1067
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:11,950
implies and this is my estimate

1068
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,070
something like a factor of eight

1069
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:16,930
potential increase in energy demand how

1070
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,740
do I get to that number well a factor to

1071
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:21,880
to stay even with the 2000 demand and

1072
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,200
depict your own number I pick about a

1073
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,830
factor of 4 or more to meet the

1074
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,490
aspirations and of developing countries

1075
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:33,160
and to slow population growth now you

1076
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:35,050
might want to add an X Factor here to

1077
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,920
mitigate climate change which ever way

1078
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:39,940
climate goes warmer or cooler

1079
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,540
technologically the way you mitigated is

1080
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:46,830
with energy mitigate its consequences so

1081
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:49,510
there is some very large factor it's

1082
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:51,980
resulted in an increase in energy supply

1083
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:55,820
now I think you all seen this picture

1084
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:57,950
it's useful in various ways it certainly

1085
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:01,369
shows where energy is being used and

1086
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:03,770
where it's not being used it's essential

1087
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:07,130
certainly for the health economy and

1088
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:08,720
safety of the United States and I would

1089
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,510
submit for the preservation of our

1090
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,480
freedom if we are not able to

1091
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,890
continually increase our use of energy I

1092
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,859
think we're going to be vulnerable to

1093
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,869
many in many different ways but we are

1094
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:22,970
also vulnerable if we continue to use it

1095
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:25,550
in the way we've been using it in the

1096
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:28,880
past now let's talk about some fusion

1097
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:31,130
fuel cycles as they're relevant to the

1098
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,619
moon and what we found on the surface of

1099
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,540
the Moon the first generation fuels your

1100
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:37,570
most of you will be familiar with it's

1101
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,270
been the focus of billions of dollars of

1102
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:43,760
federal and international effort to

1103
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:47,150
develop a deuterium tritium fuel cycle

1104
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,730
using tokamak technology primarily where

1105
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:52,820
your primary a reaction product is a

1106
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:55,010
neutron that is then captured in the

1107
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,109
walls of a reactor and converted to heat

1108
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,200
and then converted to electricity heat

1109
00:50:57,109 --> 00:51:01,460
converted to electricity

1110
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,220
another first-generation cycle that

1111
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:07,930
isn't very popular because of its very

1112
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:11,089
high Neutron flux is deuterium deuterium

1113
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:13,040
it does have some other applications too

1114
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:16,010
for developing Neutron sources and the

1115
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,260
like but it still has to be considered

1116
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,579
one of the first generation fuels second

1117
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:24,920
generation fuels are not being looked at

1118
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:26,390
by anyone systematically other than the

1119
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,310
group we have at Wisconsin that I'm

1120
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:30,980
aware of although we don't know what the

1121
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:32,869
Chinese are doing and right now the

1122
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,380
Japanese are more interested in the

1123
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:38,300
deuterium deuterium cycle the term

1124
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,010
helium-3 is it has a great advantage

1125
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,079
because theoretically what you get out

1126
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,240
of it is a proton which is obviously

1127
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,520
positively charged and controllable and

1128
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,329
does not create the problems neutrons

1129
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,480
caused in the creation of radioactive

1130
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:56,329
and damaged first walls a third

1131
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:59,030
generation fuel theoretically again is

1132
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:01,700
helium-3 helium-3 that has not been

1133
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:05,720
demonstrated to my knowledge as a

1134
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,890
in terms of effusion cycle but we expect

1135
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,539
that we will probably have such a

1136
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:12,349
demonstration with the next few months

1137
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:14,329
at Wisconsin using a new machine and

1138
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:16,009
that is even obviously more advantageous

1139
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:18,499
because of the increased number of

1140
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:21,579
protons produced which again can be

1141
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:26,960
converted directly or electricity now

1142
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:28,970
the in Wisconsin we have this laboratory

1143
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,529
Cluj device which of course no one at

1144
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:32,980
MIT would ever be caught dead with a

1145
00:52:30,529 --> 00:52:35,930
device that looks like this built at the

1146
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:40,700
products left over from other research

1147
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:43,099
experiments we have just been working to

1148
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:47,480
have a much nicer looking device you see

1149
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:49,249
here thanks to the initial design work

1150
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,829
done for the Marshall Space Flight

1151
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:53,210
Center they no longer are apparently

1152
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:55,039
working in this field but they're a

1153
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,390
company that built a device for them

1154
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,609
built this for us with some

1155
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:01,599
modifications and this will be used for

1156
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:05,029
our helium 3 helium 3 research without

1157
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,609
putting any deuterium in it at all this

1158
00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:09,650
gives you a maybe a feeling for what it

1159
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:11,269
looks like to look into one of these IEC

1160
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,940
devices and inertial electrostatic

1161
00:53:11,269 --> 00:53:15,739
devices where you have an outer grid and

1162
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:19,369
integrated with a potential across them

1163
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:23,809
across which you accelerate your your

1164
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:26,480
reaction products we've gotten to a very

1165
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:28,880
high rate of reaction steady state now

1166
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:34,489
this is not pulse this is steady state

1167
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:36,230
and goes on for minutes and in fact it

1168
00:53:34,489 --> 00:53:39,700
can go on for an hour at a time or more

1169
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:43,670
at this point the this is about a

1170
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:46,130
million OTT mistaken power that you see

1171
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,140
in that last picture the availability of

1172
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,430
helium-3 is well documented we've seen

1173
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,249
it in all the samples that have been

1174
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:55,930
brought back from the moon we know a lot

1175
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:59,450
about its distribution because it is

1176
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:02,210
co-located with high concentrations of

1177
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:04,400
titanium due to the its retention and

1178
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:09,410
the mineral ilmenite again iron titanium

1179
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,759
oxide current estimates are that if you

1180
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:13,460
take the moon as a whole which you

1181
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:14,890
wouldn't do you have it down to three

1182
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,960
meters about a million

1183
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,420
metric tons of helium-3 embedded in the

1184
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,720
lunar soil over the last three or four

1185
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:25,029
billion years and the geology of those

1186
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,799
soils is really well understood it if

1187
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:28,240
you were an economic geologist looking

1188
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:30,880
at this I think I can convince you that

1189
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,309
we we know an awful lot about the lunar

1190
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,260
regolith based on the landings we've had

1191
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:38,440
and based on remote sensing that's been

1192
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:40,539
done since the significance is that one

1193
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,150
ton of helium-3 can produce ten thousand

1194
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:44,650
megawatt years of electrical energy

1195
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,109
that's a lot that's about what a city of

1196
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:52,750
ten million people will use today in a

1197
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:55,119
year the so some 40 tons looking again

1198
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,950
this for two thousand of helium-3 would

1199
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,869
have provided for our entire US

1200
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:01,839
electrical consumption in that time now

1201
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:03,910
you would never expect to have to take

1202
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:05,950
charge of that market instantaneously

1203
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:09,430
you would enter it slowly as new plant

1204
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:11,410
and comes required and old plan was

1205
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:15,940
retired if you could compete with

1206
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:17,769
existing sources of energy now one

1207
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,809
another way to look at the value of this

1208
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:22,359
helium-3 is that again if a plant

1209
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:24,430
existed today to use it the value of

1210
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:26,200
today's oil prices would be of a ton of

1211
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:28,269
metric ton of helium-3 would be about

1212
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,970
four million dollars four billion

1213
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:32,470
dollars so maybe with that in mind it's

1214
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,660
about time we took another walk on the

1215
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:37,950
moon and with that I'd be happy to take

1216
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,950
any questions at time permits

1217
00:55:45,580 --> 00:56:01,060
a couple of decades what do you think

1218
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:11,250
that they will probably be looking for

1219
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:14,080
there and is based on your experience I

1220
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:17,670
strongly suspect that their primary

1221
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:20,410
motivation is national prestige and

1222
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:23,800
competitive with the United States in

1223
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:26,050
some way but the fact that they seem to

1224
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,490
be talking about the moon and some of

1225
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,680
the ways they have I wouldn't be a bit

1226
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,810
surprised that if if the truth were

1227
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,260
known they probably have a lunar

1228
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:36,430
resource initiative in mind as well

1229
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,320
certainly the Japanese have been active

1230
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:40,690
in this field since the potential was

1231
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,980
helium-3 was first identified by the

1232
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:47,860
University of Wisconsin folks at the

1233
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:49,450
under dr. Cole sense key but and I

1234
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,160
suspect the Chinese have pretty well

1235
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,080
been monitoring that as well we don't

1236
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,830
know we meet with the Japanese regularly

1237
00:56:53,080 --> 00:57:00,700
every two years to on the fusion

1238
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:02,830
technology side of things and so we know

1239
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,950
we have some insight into what they are

1240
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:07,480
thinking and doing it's an important

1241
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,030
part of their thinking relative to their

1242
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,840
lunar program and which they've had in

1243
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,210
mind for some time

1244
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,560
we just don't know whether this is

1245
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,540
something the Chinese are thinking of

1246
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,820
it's not going to surprise me if they

1247
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,680
are very familiar with what's been going

1248
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:23,980
on in the open literature on this

1249
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:28,390
subject all right I can't tell you

1250
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:31,480
whether the United States Congress would

1251
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:34,180
react react the way it did to this the

1252
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,700
launch of Sputnik and then to support

1253
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:41,170
the president President Kennedy after

1254
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:43,390
the launch of Yuri Gagarin I just don't

1255
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:45,070
know I don't know it's awfully hard to

1256
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:48,580
predict as I talked to some of you

1257
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:51,400
earlier how the political system is

1258
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:54,160
going to work at any given time are not

1259
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,190
work as the case may be and that is the

1260
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,170
reason I have looked much more because

1261
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:02,140
it's more predictable I think and I can

1262
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:03,849
target what I have to do at at getting

1263
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,599
the private sector involved to get back

1264
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:10,869
to the moon it it's just if you do your

1265
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,819
job right in business planning and an

1266
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:15,160
implementation then you can keep

1267
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:16,930
investors interested in what you're

1268
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:20,950
doing and have a sustained commitment by

1269
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:24,549
investors to a to interim as well as

1270
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:27,520
long-term returns on investment I find

1271
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:28,660
that a little easier to tackle than

1272
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,180
trying to figure out what the

1273
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,440
government's going to do next and so

1274
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,450
that's where we've been putting most of

1275
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,369
our effort is trying to put together the

1276
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:38,799
business plans for the early businesses

1277
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:41,670
not the lunar we have some general

1278
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:44,109
strategies for the lunar power

1279
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:47,790
initiative but mainly we've been looking

1280
00:58:44,109 --> 00:58:51,339
at how you use these electrostatic

1281
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:54,490
fusion devices at low power levels for

1282
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:57,430
useful purposes here on earth the first

1283
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:59,380
one we're looking at is to is not very

1284
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:01,900
far away in terms of technology and that

1285
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:05,020
is to have a 1 watt device that can

1286
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:07,960
produce positron emitting isotopes at

1287
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:13,599
the point of use for PE T for positron

1288
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:17,349
emitting tomography and where you can't

1289
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,930
do that today today the isotopes used in

1290
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:23,170
PE T Diagnostics are produced by large

1291
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:25,390
cyclotrons in large urban areas the one

1292
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:28,299
of choice today fluorine-18 has 110

1293
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:30,780
minute half-life which you can transport

1294
00:59:28,299 --> 00:59:33,339
at a few hundred miles but it starts to

1295
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,859
become more difficult you have to have a

1296
00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:38,020
large excess to transport it much

1297
00:59:35,859 --> 00:59:40,660
farther than that there are other

1298
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:43,750
positron emitting isotopes that we can

1299
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:47,049
handle that have about a 10-minute

1300
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:49,780
half-life nitrogen 13 for example and

1301
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:51,579
that is very attractive because unlike

1302
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:53,829
fluorine-18 it can be used in

1303
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:56,829
diagnostics for pregnant women and

1304
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:59,740
children whereas fluorine-18 cannot be

1305
00:59:56,829 --> 01:00:01,270
used that way today by regulation so

1306
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,740
that's our first business we're looking

1307
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:07,400
at there's some others along the way as

1308
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:09,080
our power levels would rise and

1309
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,720
probably one of the more interesting

1310
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:14,330
ones even before you get to break-even

1311
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,940
with these devices is having enough

1312
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:19,280
proton fluence that you can begin to

1313
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:22,430
transmute systematically transmute

1314
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,050
radioactive waste it's going to be an

1315
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:26,030
interesting engineering designed to how

1316
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,430
you get the flow of the waste past your

1317
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:29,990
your proton fluence but I'm satisfied

1318
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:32,540
that engineers are clever enough to

1319
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:34,700
figure that out and we haven't started

1320
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,260
to work on that yet we've been primarily

1321
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:39,010
focused on the positron emitting an

1322
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,010
isotope reduction

1323
01:00:54,090 --> 01:01:05,260
well I'm reluctant to give anyone advice

1324
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:12,190
however it was the advice I gave this

1325
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:14,110
administration in mid 2001 and that is

1326
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:16,140
that and one of them they're doing now

1327
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:18,250
because they have to do it and that is a

1328
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:21,100
Delta flight readiness review of the

1329
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:24,490
Space Shuttle unfortunately it was not

1330
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:26,830
done earlier and who knows where they

1331
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:28,120
would picked up that flaw or not but it

1332
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,820
certainly was clear that they're not

1333
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,920
things that happened to impact shuttle

1334
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:35,740
operations that it was time to take a

1335
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:40,030
deep breath and and look at it this was

1336
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:43,060
two years ago the the main thing that I

1337
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:45,510
think Sean O'Keefe has concentrated on

1338
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,160
what everybody thought was job one for

1339
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:50,860
NASA and that is to fix the financial

1340
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,540
management system of the agency but

1341
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:54,340
there were there was job two and three

1342
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,050
as well that should have been taken on

1343
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:58,150
at the same time and I just don't know

1344
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:59,860
whether that has been and one was

1345
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,930
program management NASA had forgotten

1346
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:04,000
how to conduct program management they

1347
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:07,390
were paying bills to major contractors

1348
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,980
without looking at what milestones and

1349
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,350
others if they didn't have the

1350
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:14,230
milestones for one thing take the X 33

1351
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:15,730
for example and they just they'd

1352
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:19,690
forgotten what program management meant

1353
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:22,810
and also in a more in the the and the

1354
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:25,060
the NASA had forgotten what risk

1355
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:26,680
management meant and that both from the

1356
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:28,930
technical and the financial side of

1357
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,030
things how do you manage your risk and

1358
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:33,430
they just had weren't doing that now

1359
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:35,770
whether that is being done now in the

1360
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:37,180
agency I just don't know but if I were

1361
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:39,730
to advise the administrator at this

1362
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,710
point I say you've got to focus for the

1363
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:44,680
long term on the financial the program

1364
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:47,080
and the risk management systems and get

1365
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,690
them up to speed so you can indeed

1366
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:54,070
manage these large programs and manage

1367
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:55,090
them with minimum risk I you know I

1368
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:58,060
would have had an entirely different

1369
01:02:55,090 --> 01:03:01,030
space program had I been asked in 1972

1370
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:03,460
or 73 but that's water under the bridge

1371
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:05,600
now and you you have to use what you

1372
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,220
have as long as you get is

1373
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:11,270
reasonable to use it and look onto the

1374
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:13,640
future and see what what can be done i I

1375
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:16,610
don't know that NASA can they can get

1376
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:19,370
that the sustained support as it is as

1377
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:22,070
it exists today for a return to deep

1378
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:24,830
space I suspect they'll be able to

1379
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:26,990
sustain support for continued operations

1380
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:32,420
in low-earth orbit and space station

1381
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:34,340
operations but I just I don't know how

1382
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:36,830
right now you put these things together

1383
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,180
now may be a significant initiative by

1384
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:39,980
the Chinese will stimulate other

1385
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,660
thoughts in the Congress and then the

1386
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:49,060
administration will just have to wait

1387
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:49,060
and see yes sir

1388
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,170
pilots

1389
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:06,880
well let me take that from two

1390
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:11,230
perspectives if if you were going to fly

1391
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:14,140
an Apollo 18 I think that with a

1392
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:18,690
three-person crew and maybe a few more

1393
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:22,480
days I think the the mix of a of a pilot

1394
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:25,809
and a trained field geologist is a good

1395
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:28,269
mix and because particularly if the

1396
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:30,819
pilot is as willing as most of the crew

1397
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:34,950
the commanders of the last few Apollo

1398
01:04:30,819 --> 01:04:37,539
missions were - to learn a lot about

1399
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:40,180
what observational field geology is all

1400
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:42,220
about you can't substitute a decade or

1401
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,829
two of experience in a short period of

1402
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,880
time but you certainly with test pilots

1403
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:48,910
you're dealing with good observers

1404
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:51,309
anyway people who are well educated and

1405
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:55,440
bright to begin with and so we I think

1406
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:57,640
all the teams were pretty good teams the

1407
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,609
only speak for the two I worked with

1408
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,109
dick Gordon and Gene Cernan and I think

1409
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:07,119
we did about as much as you could expect

1410
01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:09,940
to do under the circumstances the now if

1411
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:12,450
you begin to look at much longer

1412
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:17,140
duration stays for scientific purposes

1413
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:19,839
then you clearly will have pilots you'll

1414
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:21,910
want pilots to get you get other

1415
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:23,470
specialists to there and back but you'll

1416
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:25,619
probably get more into the kind of

1417
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:28,989
operation of a space shuttle program

1418
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:30,880
where you have a bit of a dichotomy

1419
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:33,549
between the pilots and the

1420
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,279
other professionals that will be doing

1421
01:05:33,549 --> 01:05:38,019
specialized tasks and that same probably

1422
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:42,849
applies to if you do it with a private

1423
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:45,339
sector effort is that you the private

1424
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:48,009
sector corporation would probably be

1425
01:05:45,339 --> 01:05:50,289
hiring pilots as their routine operators

1426
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:53,259
of spacecraft back and forth to the moon

1427
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:55,749
and then have maybe even more diverse

1428
01:05:53,259 --> 01:06:00,579
specialties than even NASA would

1429
01:05:55,749 --> 01:06:04,390
consider - ranging from people who can

1430
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:07,660
operate highly robotic but still not

1431
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:10,140
fully robotic mining systems processing

1432
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:11,820
systems as well as

1433
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,020
geologists can call them economic

1434
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,180
jealousy will who are doing the

1435
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:17,100
precursor planning mind planning and

1436
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:19,230
that kind of thing it becomes a much

1437
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:23,040
more sophisticated operation with a wide

1438
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:26,220
variety of skills required engineering

1439
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,800
design for example for for any I think

1440
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:33,410
corporate effort on the moon is going to

1441
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:38,990
include all not only a focus on robotic

1442
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:42,120
operation of equipment but also on

1443
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:44,550
embedded diagnostics just-in-time

1444
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,810
maintenance a whole bunch of things like

1445
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:48,030
that that have to be done so you don't

1446
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:50,490
stop operating because you're going to

1447
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:53,220
have contracts to fulfill back here on

1448
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:55,080
earth it creates a quite a different

1449
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,340
perspective I think on how you engineer

1450
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,440
things when you have to think in terms

1451
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:01,050
that everything I do wrong hasn't cost

1452
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:04,800
me money and cut and cut the investor

1453
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:06,000
return it's it's an interesting new way

1454
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,740
to look I never looked at things like

1455
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,510
that before until about 10 years ago and

1456
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,890
I started to think along these lines

1457
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:24,990
that it might be more predictable than

1458
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:29,160
working with the government yes sir that

1459
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:34,620
is known I know the last eruption namely

1460
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:36,270
sunset crater was in 1066 I think they

1461
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,839
heard about the Norman invasion and

1462
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:44,229
decided

1463
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:46,209
to erupt the but that that has been an

1464
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:48,189
act he feel far for millions of years

1465
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:51,430
earlier than that and I I just don't

1466
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:53,709
know the exact numbers you know clearly

1467
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:55,359
it was active before the last major

1468
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:59,019
glaciation because there's a great

1469
01:07:55,359 --> 01:08:01,509
glacial Cirque in the top of Mount

1470
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:03,369
Humphreys if you've ever been up there

1471
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:06,160
it's really quite a spectacular place to

1472
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:08,140
hike and climb is in that glacier that

1473
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:10,539
fed out actually fed out to the north

1474
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:19,359
east I believe from the top of the

1475
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:21,429
mountain yes sir standing on the moon

1476
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:25,589
was my most memorable impression was

1477
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:25,589
probably standing on the moon you know

1478
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:32,710
certainly not something I anticipated

1479
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:34,750
doing before before November of 1964

1480
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:37,960
when I saw the announcement on a

1481
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:40,170
bulletin board and Flagstaff that NASA

1482
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,489
wanted scientists astronauts to apply

1483
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:44,440
I'm not sure they wanted it but at least

1484
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:50,049
the National Academy said they wanted it

1485
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:51,639
and and it all worked out the I did I

1486
01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:53,980
just that was not something that I had

1487
01:08:51,639 --> 01:08:55,569
planned to do and and I've often advised

1488
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:57,219
young people is that that's one reason

1489
01:08:55,569 --> 01:09:00,549
why you've got to try to get as broad

1490
01:08:57,219 --> 01:09:02,199
and as detailed simultaneously education

1491
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:03,909
you possibly can to be ready for the

1492
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:07,239
next opportunity that you don't know

1493
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:08,730
about and and fundamental to all of that

1494
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:11,230
is having a background in mathematics

1495
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:13,029
because it's the language of opportunity

1496
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:15,489
in any kind of technical or scientific

1497
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:19,359
field and it should be thought of as a

1498
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:20,529
language if if we don't see and I don't

1499
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,639
I doubt if there's anybody in this

1500
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:23,739
audience that doesn't agree with this

1501
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:27,250
but I think that that one of the biggest

1502
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:29,139
thing we do to hurt young people today

1503
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:31,750
is keep them from learning mathematics

1504
01:09:29,139 --> 01:09:33,460
at any time when they're young as a

1505
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,839
language they don't like to use it they

1506
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,909
can often do other things but if you

1507
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:38,500
don't have it you've eliminated a whole

1508
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:41,799
spectrum of professional opportunities

1509
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:46,089
in the future that you just never be

1510
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:50,049
able to grasp the but meanwhile back on

1511
01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:51,410
the moon I suspect that the full

1512
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:54,890
realization

1513
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:57,710
being there did not really click on

1514
01:09:54,890 --> 01:10:01,250
totally until about 30 minutes after I

1515
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:02,840
was outside the spacecraft and had a

1516
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:06,650
chance to move away from the lunar

1517
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:08,450
module challenger and to take the first

1518
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:11,920
set of panoramic pictures that we wanted

1519
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:15,050
before we've totally trashed the place

1520
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,480
and and and that was the first time I

1521
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:19,700
was able to see the lunar module in the

1522
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,590
context of this immense mountain valley

1523
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:23,990
we were in a valley deeper than the

1524
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:26,200
Grand Canyon the mountains on either

1525
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:29,300
side were six seven thousand feet high

1526
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,700
black sky brilliant blue earth and of

1527
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:35,060
course a brilliant Sun as bright as any

1528
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:37,550
Sun that you can imagine and to finally

1529
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:40,850
have a chance to see all of that while I

1530
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:43,400
was taking this panoramic picture was

1531
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:46,100
really probably when I first the impact

1532
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:48,590
of being there hit me it wasn't it

1533
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,510
didn't stop me or anything like that but

1534
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:52,280
you start to absorb those kind of things

1535
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,900
at that point prior to that I was

1536
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:56,060
dealing with a spacecraft that I was

1537
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:58,850
very familiar with it I'd worked simmer

1538
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:01,310
and around and the test bays that at the

1539
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:03,020
Kennedy Space Center I had worked with

1540
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:05,390
many lunar modules and particularly this

1541
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:07,100
one in the past so it was not and your

1542
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:08,900
field of view is always restricted a

1543
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,700
little bit in those helmets so I was

1544
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,620
looking at an old friend that somebody

1545
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,630
and I was working around it and I hadn't

1546
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:16,280
really seen what I was going to see

1547
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:18,890
until I moved away from that spacecraft

1548
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,990
and that was really it was quite an

1549
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:22,990
event

1550
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:22,990
yes

1551
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:45,260
no I you know apologist sort of

1552
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:48,100
triggered revolution in data handling

1553
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:53,570
data processing information and the like

1554
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:55,610
the the the draper primary guidance

1555
01:11:53,570 --> 01:12:00,680
navigation system the pings that we use

1556
01:11:55,610 --> 01:12:05,090
to go to the moon was barely a

1557
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:07,850
calculator and most of the computing was

1558
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:09,710
being done by several floors of IBM what

1559
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:12,890
were they thirty-three hundreds at that

1560
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:16,280
time or who knows but a huge IBM

1561
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:17,930
computers down here on earth and the the

1562
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,880
results of that computation then fed

1563
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:22,520
into our computer which was just capable

1564
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,530
of using it for extraordinarily precise

1565
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,360
landings so it was it was certainly

1566
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:28,910
adequate to the job we landed within a

1567
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:30,500
few tens of meters of where we planned

1568
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:34,490
to land on every mission except Apollo

1569
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:35,960
11 and and would have landed evenly had

1570
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:39,080
we just let the computer take us exactly

1571
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,910
where he wanted to go rather than taking

1572
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,860
over a manual control we would have

1573
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:45,170
landed essentially right where we

1574
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:46,820
planned the spot but usually there was a

1575
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:49,460
boulder or crater at that point and you

1576
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,810
wanted to move away from it that it

1577
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:57,980
seemed like a rational thing to do at

1578
01:12:50,810 --> 01:13:00,350
the time the just an example of the of

1579
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:02,090
what we were doing with some of most of

1580
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:04,520
you some of you may know that we were

1581
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:07,460
delayed 2 hours and 40 minutes in our

1582
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:12,470
launch because of the of a computer

1583
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:14,600
glitch the is one of those garbage in

1584
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:18,020
garbage out things where for some reason

1585
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,840
in the launch control computer way back

1586
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:23,410
and then lost in the dark ages the

1587
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:26,240
computer had been told in the final

1588
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:30,610
countdown checks that occurred at 30

1589
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:33,410
seconds to look and see if a tank had

1590
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:37,160
been told to be pressurized rather than

1591
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:40,130
whether it was pressurized and when it

1592
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:44,090
went through that at an earlier point

1593
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:45,830
through that control it the tank the one

1594
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:48,530
of the oxygen tanks in the I think the s

1595
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:51,000
1c stage had been told will be

1596
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:54,870
pressurized it didn't react to that come

1597
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:57,630
from the computer and a launch

1598
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:59,340
controller saw that that happened and

1599
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:00,690
just punched it and manually pressurized

1600
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,400
the tank so the tank was perfectly

1601
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:04,650
alright it was pressurized ready to go

1602
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,420
but the computer didn't know it and so

1603
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,830
at 30 seconds it finally said I'm not

1604
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,870
gonna let you go well it's just what you

1605
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:11,430
wanted it to do if it wasn't sure but

1606
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:15,450
you can see that it was looking at the

1607
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:17,130
wrong parameter why it wasn't told to

1608
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:20,250
look at a pressure transducer in the

1609
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:23,850
tank I don't know but that held things

1610
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:28,020
up for two hours and 40 minutes most of

1611
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:30,000
which was time it took to convince NASA

1612
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:32,430
management that the people knew what was

1613
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,380
wrong it didn't take very long to figure

1614
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:36,060
out what was wrong it turns out and and

1615
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:38,700
but to solve it what they did was just

1616
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:42,060
went into the computer and hardwired

1617
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:43,860
around that particular Junction I I

1618
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,810
don't know exactly what I'm doing but

1619
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:47,760
they actually hardwired in that computer

1620
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:49,530
all right these are huge banks of

1621
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,930
computers and they found the place and

1622
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:53,370
hardware so that as far as a computer

1623
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:55,200
cern everything was hunky-dory and the

1624
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:57,020
next time we went through 30 seconds off

1625
01:14:55,200 --> 01:15:00,140
we went

1626
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,140
yes sir

1627
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:18,010
I I think that it's just about

1628
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:22,210
everything that I mentioned in my early

1629
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:23,500
charts except the having met the Cold

1630
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:25,270
War challenge would have to be

1631
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,340
considered surprise because if you go

1632
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:34,600
back and look at what was being thought

1633
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:37,450
of in 61 62 63 we weren't thinking that

1634
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:40,090
we would ever get those kinds of things

1635
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:41,440
out of this mission there were a few

1636
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:46,840
people like Jean shoemaker

1637
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:49,330
Harold Urey who and a few others who on

1638
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:52,300
the science side felt that this would

1639
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:55,390
just be an amazing bonanza but the vast

1640
01:15:52,300 --> 01:16:00,520
community really wasn't paying attention

1641
01:15:55,390 --> 01:16:02,260
to to this the the idea that we would

1642
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:05,020
find resources on the moon that could

1643
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:07,660
support space civilizations nobody

1644
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:11,920
talked about that that I can remember at

1645
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:15,250
the time in fact the the importance of

1646
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,870
helium-3 wasn't recognized to to future

1647
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:20,200
energy supplies wasn't recognized until

1648
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:21,820
1985 when when a some engineering

1649
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:25,150
physicist stumbled across it in our

1650
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:28,840
literature which had been there since

1651
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:31,800
1970 the solar the people interested in

1652
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:33,990
solar wind physics had had measured it

1653
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:36,430
because that's where it came from and

1654
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:38,560
they knew about was there and they they

1655
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,940
went about their their papers wrote

1656
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,130
papers on it and everything like this

1657
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,170
but their interest was in solar wind

1658
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:46,090
physics and not in weather it was a

1659
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:47,590
resource and hunt and then once you

1660
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:50,230
start to look at that you realized well

1661
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:53,500
there's hydrogen there too and that from

1662
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:54,880
hydrogen you can make water and and you

1663
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:58,840
have the oxygen of course in the rocks

1664
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:01,210
so that was totally unintuitive nobody

1665
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:04,030
people just had not thought about that

1666
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:05,860
and it and and and from the evolutionary

1667
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:07,480
status of the species I never heard

1668
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:13,540
anybody talk about that until well after

1669
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:15,130
Apollo was was passed so clearly the

1670
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:17,670
objective was made that's what everybody

1671
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:20,860
signed up for as to land on the moon and

1672
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:24,460
fortunately people like George Lowe some

1673
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:27,970
of you knew George and Bob Gilruth Sam

1674
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:30,370
Phillips and and Verner von braun they

1675
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:32,830
all sort of had this vision that we were

1676
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:34,900
going to do a lot more with apollo than

1677
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:39,160
anybody thought we were going to do and

1678
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:42,340
frankly I think that began to be obvious

1679
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:45,310
when you realize that the lunar module

1680
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:48,340
and the Saturn 5 and the command module

1681
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:50,500
were all way over designed in the final

1682
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:54,660
analysis to just land on the moon and

1683
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:57,220
come home the the lunar module actually

1684
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:58,990
right from the very beginning the first

1685
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:05,650
design reference mission that Grumman

1686
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:07,090
did had a four-day stay and on Brown you

1687
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:10,480
know he'd give you a little bit more for

1688
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:12,850
every mission and but at the beginning

1689
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,680
nobody thought we would put 44 metric

1690
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:17,350
tons on a trajectory to the moon with a

1691
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:20,350
Saturn 5 he may have but he didn't tell

1692
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:23,080
anybody about it and we had to squeeze

1693
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:24,850
every metric ton out of him for Apollo 8

1694
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,380
Politan he'd give you a little more for

1695
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:29,050
Apollo 10 a little more for Apollo 11

1696
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:31,090
yeah you know I had some secret little

1697
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:33,280
supply of thrust that he had over here

1698
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:36,250
and he kept giving it give me a little

1699
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,200
bit more but for Apollo 17 it was the

1700
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:40,330
heaviest payload and it was a 44 metric

1701
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:45,670
tons to the moon and that's a heck of a

1702
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:48,310
heck of a launch and we had that for a

1703
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:49,540
while we had that kind of capability one

1704
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,920
thing just to think about and then I'll

1705
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:54,220
stop because I know Wes is trying to

1706
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:57,480
give me the hook here but for a very

1707
01:18:54,220 --> 01:19:02,980
brief period of time between nineteen

1708
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:04,750
literally between 1968 1972 we had the

1709
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:08,110
capability to do something about an

1710
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:11,140
asteroid or comet that might be on a

1711
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:14,380
trajectory to impact the earth you don't

1712
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:16,180
have that capability now technologically

1713
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:20,590
you could recreate it but you don't have

1714
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:23,080
it so we're in a very unique position

1715
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:25,900
right now in terms of human civilization

1716
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:27,760
there's still a major debate and major

1717
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:30,070
discussion and I don't know what my

1718
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,630
opinion is on whether you know how much

1719
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:33,430
investment you make an extraordinarily

1720
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:36,640
low risk but extraordinarily high

1721
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:40,810
consequence events in predicting and in

1722
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:42,250
in preventing such events but at least

1723
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:44,110
we are at a point right now where we can

1724
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:46,300
have that discussion and it's a

1725
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:49,390
realistic discussion and that's one of

1726
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,800
the side benefits of some initiative

1727
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:52,930
that gets us back to the moon is that

1728
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,240
you also create this capability again

1729
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:56,620
and create it indefinitely because

1730
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:00,790
you're always going to need heavy lift

1731
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:02,170
launch to work in deep space ladies and

1732
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:05,130
gentlemen thank you very much it's been

1733
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:05,130

and a Senate senator you have certainly

1738
01:20:30,019 --> 01:20:34,969
provided us with a very stimulating

1739
01:20:32,049 --> 01:20:36,829
account of what happened

1740
01:20:34,969 --> 01:20:39,559
on our way to the moon and what our

1741
01:20:36,829 --> 01:20:42,199
future may may be like so thank you so

1742
01:20:39,559 --> 01:20:44,539
very very much jack I will also like to

1745
01:20:47,329 --> 01:20:52,339
particular event
