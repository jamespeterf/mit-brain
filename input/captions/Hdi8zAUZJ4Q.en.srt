00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,760
8. Are you sure that's a risk?

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,920
If something can go wrong, it will go

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
wrong. This is what's known as Murphy's

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,680
law, and it is one of those awkward

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
rules of thumb that every engineer has

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,720
had to wrestle with. Just keep it in

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
mind for now. The common advice given to

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,040
innovators and entrepreneurs is that you

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,600
should focus. You're told to pick one

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,480
idea or one market or one user,

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,079
whatever, and work on it. The advice

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
makes it seem like this is only your

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,040
choice to make. The more focused you

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,800
are, the lower the risk. But you are not

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,239
being advised to focus per se. Rather,

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,039
you're being told to narrow your

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,640
options. There is a difference. Remember

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
the analogy we drew between working on

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
the problem and what Chris Hatfield said

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,120
about the way astronauts prepare for

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,120
missions to the International Space

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,280
Station. The way you were being asked to

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,039
focus is similar to telling astronauts

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,720
to pay attention only to problems in

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,880
some part of the rocket and ignore

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
everything else. The problem with that

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,760
advice is Murphy's law. It always stands

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,360
in the way. If something can go wrong,

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,200
it will. And as Chris Hatfield put it,

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,439
you just decided to not pay attention to

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
many things that can kill you. The same

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,360
might be true for your innovating.

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
Narrowing your options at the start to

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,799
just the one idea increases your risk

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,000
and gives you a false sense of

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,720
certainty. That's exactly the opposite

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,799
of what you want. Focusing and narrowing

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,119
are not the same thing. This is easy to

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,200
see in a camera. When you zoom, you

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,840
narrow the field of view. When you focus

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,840
the image, the image gains sharpness and

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,840
clarity, but the field of view stays the

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
same. Whether you are the innovator or

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,840
the capital, you want to reduce risk by

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,159
increasing clarity around what you are

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,640
doing. Narrowing your options only

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
increases risks. Like Murphy's law and

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
the distinction between focus and

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,640
narrowing, in the new mindset, we avail

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,960
ourselves of several finance and general

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,600
engineering principles like preventing

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
error accumulation, diversification, the

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,280
difference between precision and

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,280
accuracy, and many more that fall beyond

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,360
the scope of this introductory course.

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,360
Those principles help innovators make

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
informed decisions without wasting time

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,040
or inadvertently increasing risk. In the

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,680
MIT mindset, students do this by keeping

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
at least three distinct options open

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
throughout their explorations. They

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
focus on coming up with next steps and

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
actions that will help them advance in

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,440
all three at the same time. Which three

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
they focus on might change as they gain

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
understanding of the problem, but

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,560
keeping three options open helps them

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,760
keep Murphy's law at bay. Chances are

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
this is not the first time you heard

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,959
about Murphy's law, but it might be the

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,599
first time you hear it connected with

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
innovation. We hear so many things about

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
innovation that sometimes we forget what

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
should be obvious. The way I typically

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
summarize this for my students is that

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
there's a lot of things you need to

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,280
unlearn about innovation so you can

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
actually use the skills you already

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,440
have. The next video tell you all there

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,680
is to unlearn so you can actually truly

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,680
start innovating.
