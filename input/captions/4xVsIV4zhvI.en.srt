1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,759
okay good

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,119
morning so we started talking about

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,119
systems with chemical

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,680
reactions and

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,000
we just go quickly over what we have

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
done so far

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:39,879
we set we consider the two uh uh most

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:44,160
representative setups the closed

9
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,640
system up here and the uh open system uh

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,600
uh

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,199
setup for which of course when we

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,440
analyze uh we have to make uh at least

13
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,680
the energy and the entropy balance and

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,680
sometimes also uh here also the volume

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,680
balance

16
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,280
and these balances take these

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,360
forms where these differences between

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,320
properties of the uh products and the

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,680
reactants energy entropy here the

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,320
enthalpies because we have bulk flow

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,479
interactions

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,280
are uh

23
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:28,280
important and they have U the

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,520
feature that we need

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,200
to um

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,040
we need to deal with the fact that the

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,799
composition changes now because uh as

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,799
the process proceeds we have a chemical

29
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,360
reaction in place one or more chemical

30
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,640
reactions in

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:52,000
place we introduced the notation for

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,399
stochiometry and the proportionality

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,360
relations and we defined the properties

34
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,159
of reaction as a way

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,840
to concentrate

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
the part of the change in the properties

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,879
that has to do with the change in

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,800
composition in this last term where we

39
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,720
um have the product of the reaction

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,319
coordinate and what we called uh the

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
property of reaction for example this is

42
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,680
the energy of reaction the enthalpy of

43
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,400
reaction but in the same way we can

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,080
Define also the entropy that gives free

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,000
energy and the volume of the

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:36,599
reaction and remember that if uh the not

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,599
here means standard pressure so one

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,040
atmosphere um the not here without the

49
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,800
temperature dependence means also

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,360
standard temperature so STP

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,040
means uh this a standard temperature 25

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
degre C and one

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,360
atmosphere it

54
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,640
may seem that we have to measure

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,519
properties of reaction for every

56
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,440
reaction that we have to deal with but

57
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,440
fortunately that's not necessary all we

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,200
need to do is to measure the properties

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,840
of reaction for what we will Define as

60
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,440
the

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,440
uh reactions of

62
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,959
formation these properties of reaction

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,200
for example this is a reaction of

64
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,760
formation from molecular hydrogen which

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,959
is the most stable uh species for

66
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:37,200
hydrogen in um at STP and uh it's the

67
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:41,640
formation from that to

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,879
Atomic hydrogen which is not which is

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,920
also an elemental species but it's not

70
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:52,159
uh the most stable and in order to go

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,920
from here to there we have to break this

72
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,000
hydrogen

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:02,200
bond and that requires energy and this

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,280
is why uh we the the curve that

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,319
represents the equilibrium state for

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,200
hydrogen even at zero

77
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:14,239
temperature uh is above the curve that

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,799
represents the um molecular hydrogen uh

79
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,079
States and at zero temperature this

80
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,600
difference is precisely what we call uh

81
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
the bond

82
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,600
energy instead what we call the property

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,800
of

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,039
reaction doesn't refer to zero

85
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,400
temperature it refers to standard

86
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:39,479
temperature T

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,600
not so it is the difference between that

88
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:46,039
property in this case the enthalpy if we

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,720
go vertical wise or the entropy if you

90
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:52,880
go horizontal Wise from the difference

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,720
in the uh enthalpy or entropy between

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,919
this state and that

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,560
state okay so this represents

94
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,759
graphically the enthalpy of reaction and

95
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,759
the entropy of

96
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:18,280
reaction we ended the last lecture by

97
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,280
with this graph that wants to point

98
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,160
out that even the bond energies can be

99
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,639
described somehow as by means of the

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:32,639
Leonard Jones potential that is a

101
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:37,000
possible reasonable uh model perhaps not

102
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,840
the best but uh it it is simple enough

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,280
that one can use

104
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,880
it

105
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,400
and the values those of the parameters

106
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,199
the lender John

107
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,479
parameters for U Atomic

108
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,639
bonds Bond

109
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,720
energies Bond energies are uh at least

110
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,520
three orders of magnet itude stronger

111
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,759
than the Vander vales forces they're all

112
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,599
electrostatic forces

113
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:15,960
but the ones that you need in order to

114
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:20,280
uh form this Bond uh are much stronger

115
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:25,360
not only they occur at closer

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:30,120
distances you see this is a point seven

117
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,240
Armstrong uh with respect to uh the

118
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,319
the bottom of the Vander

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,400
vals uh forces which is at about 3 point

120
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,599
something angstrom

121
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,479
for for the liquid um for example this

122
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:48,319
is liquid

123
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,360
water and also notice that yes I have

124
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,639
plotted this but in order to make it

125
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,319
visible I had to multiply it by a factor

126
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,360
of a thousand otherwise it would be

127
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,960
almost flat as compared to the strength

128
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,960
of the

129
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,960
uh Atomic bonds calent

130
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,280
bonds

131
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,720
okay

132
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,520
now the properties of

133
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,360
reaction as we have seen at zero

134
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,199
temperature are

135
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,800
um

136
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,840
related to the bond

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,039
energies so for example if I take this

138
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,840
is the reaction of

139
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:42,479
formation of water of two molecules of

140
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:46,039
water from two molecules of hydrogen of

141
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,759
molecular hydrogen and one molecule of

142
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:51,759
oxygen in order to go from this

143
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,560
configuration to this configuration you

144
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,240
have to

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,080
break these two hydrogen bonds and the

146
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,039
oxygen Bond and then reassemble in this

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,759
other way

148
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,400
at the end in this other way in the in

149
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:12,199
two water molecules you have four

150
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,199
times and oxygen hydrogen

151
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,520
bond okay four

152
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,879
times the strength of these bonds are

153
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:29,000
listed are plotted are measured you find

154
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,519
tables that provide uh this strength and

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,440
also the

156
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:37,800
typical distance between

157
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,839
atoms between the nuclei in these bonds

158
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,640
for example the blue one is the hydrogen

159
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:50,320
it's the closest it's

160
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,560
74 Peters that's 74

161
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,120
an

162
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,440
uh the oxygen is

163
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:03,320
here and in the middle we have the hydro

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,920
nen and oxygen

165
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,399
Bond and in fact in fact if you take the

166
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,000
uh the the the depth so the strength of

167
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,120
these

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
potentials so the epsilons for the

169
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,240
lender

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,680
jnes for these bonds and you do the

171
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,000
simple counting of what's the difference

172
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:31,079
between having four of these ones four

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,079
of these ones that are worth 459

174
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:42,920
as compared to two of these ones the

175
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:48,240
hydrogen that are uh 432 and one oxygen

176
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:51,440
495 uh you you find that um the differen

177
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:57,560
is is is in in favor of of these one so

178
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,560
these are more stable they are less

179
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:06,279
uh the strong erly bound

180
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:09,920
strong more strongly bound and um and

181
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:13,800
this number which is by the accounting

182
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:18,120
of the the bonds is very close to the

183
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,240
enthalpy of formation of two moles of

184
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,519
water the

185
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:31,320
difference stays mostly in the fact that

186
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,320
whereas the bonds are computed at zero

187
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,959
Kelvin the enthalpies of formation are

188
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,800
listed at standard temperature and

189
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,360
pressure so you have to correct in going

190
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,279
from here to

191
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,440
here for the specific Heats uh from zero

192
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,720
uh temperature to uh

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,360
298k and if you do that correction you

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,600
get closer to this

195
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,800
number so in a sense this is to say that

196
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,760
the Leonard Jones representation

197
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,720
is not bad for uh giving a first look at

198
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,040
what

199
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,959
uh this properties of formation and at

200
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,399
least the enthalpy of formation comes

201
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,399
comes in comes comes

202
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,560
from

203
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,920
now this slide wants

204
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:31,200
to describe what's behind the S relation

205
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:35,120
and these properties of uh formation so

206
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,600
it turns out that we um we don't need to

207
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,399
measure all the properties of of

208
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,079
reactions but only those of uh uh

209
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,519
formation from a set uh which is

210
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,120
complete enough that uh so we Define a a

211
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,519
complete set of

212
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,839
independent chemical species from which

213
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,680
uh you can construct any other molecule

214
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:04,760
so these are like the building blocks of

215
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:09,639
chemical compounds and uh typically they

216
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,639
are called the elemental

217
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:19,320
species in order to Define this set you

218
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:23,360
need to to to request two conditions the

219
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,079
first is that yes every

220
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,240
molecule uh must

221
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,199
be uh every so you you you you construct

222
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,320
any chemical species and you have to be

223
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,199
able to construct it from these

224
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,680
Elemental species according to a

225
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,639
chemical reaction of formation which is

226
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,959
this

227
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:48,680
one now in our

228
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,639
notation where we put um everything on

229
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,839
the left hand side with the plus

230
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,800
stochiometric coefficient for the

231
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:59,519
products and with a

232
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:03,639
negative stomri coefficient for the um

233
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,440
reactants this is the way uh we would uh

234
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,519
uh write our

235
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,519
reaction but you could also write it

236
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,760
this other

237
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,480
way and formally this will be useful in

238
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,480
one step below the other condition that

239
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,399
you want to impose is that they uh the

240
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,399
set of these species be independent from

241
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:28,639
one another so that uh it is impossible

242
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,760
to convert one into the other or several

243
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,959
into the other rather that condition is

244
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,920
written by saying that if it if you ever

245
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,000
write a chemical reaction that involves

246
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,519
only Elemental

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,399
species that reaction has to be

248
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,680
identically uh trivial so zero all the

249
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,880
tetric coefficients must be zero

250
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,519
otherwise it would be possible to

251
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:00,720
transform gold I mean lead in Gold not

252
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,720
like instead of chemistry you do alchemy

253
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:10,399
um so the Practical choice is to select

254
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,040
um practical and conventional choices to

255
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,800
select as Elemental the species that

256
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,600
have only one type of nucleos example

257
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,600
the oxygen Mo molecule has two nuclei

258
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,639
but they are of the same kind so only

259
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,839
one

260
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:30,240
kind and plus since you uh you know that

261
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,800
um for example oxygen you you you can

262
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,160
find in several uh uh molecular

263
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:43,320
configuration like Atomic

264
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:46,720
oxygen uh the ion uh or ozone O3 and O2

265
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:51,720
okay you pick the one that is more

266
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,560
stable at standard uh condition so uh

267
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,600
you so you so in this way case for

268
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,480
oxygen you take

269
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:04,160
O2 and that turn turns out that you have

270
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,360
to select one species for each atomic

271
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,120
number in the periodic table I'm sure

272
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,560
you remember the periodic table uh and Z

273
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,040
is the number of protons in the nucleus

274
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,720
of the

275
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,800
atom um the actual

276
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,959
um the

277
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,880
Isotopes which has to do with the number

278
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:30,880
of neutrons that are in the um um

279
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:35,639
nucleus of the atom don't count for

280
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,360
chemistry because chemistry is mostly uh

281
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,680
uh was responsible for chemical

282
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:45,480
reactions is is the Electrical

283
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:50,399
uh the electrons and the protons and not

284
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:53,040
the the weight of the uh of the

285
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,560
nucleus which is instead important for

286
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,560
nuclear

287
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,920
reactions and of course

288
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,120
I I think you can proceed in a similar

289
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
way also if you are interested in

290
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,160
nuclear reaction so you want to apply

291
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,440
this same kind of

292
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,440
reasoning uh to the properties of

293
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,000
formation of

294
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,319
nuclei you would have to Define um a set

295
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
of complete and

296
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,160
independent uh

297
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,920
nucleons and typically you would choose

298
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,279
the proton the the neutron and the

299
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,279
electron and uh what

300
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,800
else I don't know maybe quarks are

301
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,959
different

302
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,120
level uh anyway so

303
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:48,839
um so then for this reaction of form so

304
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,240
you select your um your compound and you

305
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,839
find the stochiometric coefficients in

306
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,560
terms of that are needed in order to

307
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,319
construct your compound from the

308
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,920
elemental species these are the alphas

309
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,639
and then you write down the uh according

310
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,880
to our rule so the summation of the

311
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,559
stochiometric coefficients

312
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,319
times

313
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,600
the properties of the pure components

314
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,679
that appear in the reaction at

315
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,640
STP and this gives you the rea the

316
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,880
property of reaction and this is that

317
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,600
since it's the reaction of formation we

318
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,079
call it the property of formation of

319
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:32,880
your compound

320
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:34,640
I okay now it turns out and this is the

321
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,160
the good

322
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,160
um practical aspect of this uh

323
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,840
Choice it turns out that you can

324
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,799
safely arbitrarily

325
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,000
select a reference

326
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,720
value for

327
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,880
the property ATP of the elemental

328
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,280
species and since it's arbitrary now in

329
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,840
other words it will not uh it will

330
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:08,039
cancel out your calculations in

331
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:11,280
chemistry you can set you can select any

332
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,760
number so the the simplest is to select

333
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
equal to

334
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,320
zero why

335
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,400
so well

336
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,400
because H in your chemical problems

337
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,480
you'll have to deal with chemical

338
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,000
reactions that have this generic form

339
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,039
equal to Z so 0 equals the stochiometric

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,200
coefficients times the chemical

341
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,760
compounds now each chemical compound

342
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,679
like here can be obtained from the

343
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,679
elemental species so we can formally

344
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:48,720
substitute this formula here for the

345
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,120
compound in here and we

346
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,000
get a chemical

347
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,840
reaction that

348
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,559
involves only the elemental

349
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,679
species by the condition of Independence

350
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:05,039
that requires that these

351
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,320
um set of stochiometric coefficients be

352
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:15,039
all identically equal to

353
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:19,400
zero this is more or less the formal

354
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:22,919
um expression of what you do when

355
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,000
you uh fix these tetric coefficients in

356
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,480
the

357
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,919
reaction you balance the reaction by

358
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,919
putting the proper stomri coefficient i

359
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,970
s all right that's what you're searching

360
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,200
for

361
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,120
[Music]

362
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,919
um the new sais that

363
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,919
satisfy that solve this

364
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,280
equation

365
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:53,360
okay so now if since we're interested in

366
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,039
general in this kind of

367
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,080
reaction the property of that reaction

368
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,520
for example the energy of of reaction

369
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,720
for that reaction is given is defined

370
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,720
this

371
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,039
way if you substitute this expression

372
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,880
here because you see here we

373
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:16,440
have

374
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:20,360
uh this pure component energies at

375
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,520
STP for your substances for your

376
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,400
substances that appear in your reaction

377
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,159
and you can write them in terms of the

378
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
properties of formation and these are

379
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,080
uh summation that you take on the other

380
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
side so this is the

381
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,320
substitution and then you bring the

382
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,360
summation in and you you find that this

383
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,880
second

384
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,200
contribution has uh as

385
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,360
coefficients that are identically zero

386
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,679
for the reason that we just mentioned

387
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,440
before so this

388
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,240
summation cancels the way and therefore

389
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,360
you find that the property of real

390
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,919
reaction is equal to the weighted sum on

391
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,240
the stric coefficients of your reaction

392
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:09,320
of the properties of formation of your

393
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,440
of the of the various components that

394
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,279
appear in your reaction this is called

395
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,279
the S

396
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,799
relation and the fact that these things

397
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,000
are multiplied by zero allows you to

398
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:29,440
select any their value

399
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,799
being not important so

400
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,880
so you con conventionally select those

401
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:41,360
equal to zero and

402
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:44,279
also you could safely select that

403
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,440
the STP value for the pure components

404
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:50,720
are equal to their uh properties of

405
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,080
formation like we do here setting this

406
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,360
equal to

407
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:00,640
zero there is another

408
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,520
minor uh but dangerous complication

409
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,880
dangerous if you forget about it in your

410
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:12,279
calculations that most of the tables of

411
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,760
uh since much of this has been developed

412
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:18,159
when people dealt with combustion

413
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,360
problems and the products of combustion

414
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:24,840
are in uh in the gous

415
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,320
phase in Practical

416
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,200
applications

417
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,320
um in

418
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,000
people are

419
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:39,480
listing the values of formation of the

420
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,480
species when they are in the gaseous

421
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:47,080
phase but many species for example

422
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,559
water at standard conditions is not in

423
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,880
the gas phase because at 25 degrees C

424
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:56,120
and one atmosphere water is liquid yet

425
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,960
in the table you find the property of

426
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,679
formation of water

427
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,120
in the fictitious gaseous state so

428
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,520
what's that okay that is an sort of an

429
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,919
extrapolation of water vapor from the

430
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,279
range of states in which it behaves as

431
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,000
an ideal gas for which you know uh the

432
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:20,400
properties for example the specific

433
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,679
Heats at constant uh pressure as a and

434
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
you know them as a function of

435
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,240
temperature you they are given by

436
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,200
correlations we'll see some in a moment

437
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,480
and and what you do is to

438
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,039
extrapolate those uh properties down to

439
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:40,279
standard conditions as if that substance

440
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:45,320
kept behaving as ideal gas down to those

441
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:49,600
STP and that's how you compute this

442
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,840
from this temperature T where it behaves

443
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,080
as an ideal

444
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:59,880
gas down to to here and also for entropy

445
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,360
you just apply the the laws of ideal gas

446
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,360
and extrapolate down to

447
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,640
STP okay so these are

448
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,000
details now when you

449
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,840
compute ah yeah these

450
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,080
tables give values for the enthalpies of

451
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,279
formation of number of

452
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,880
compounds from which you can cook up all

453
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:29,279
sorts of chemical

454
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,880
reactions uh

455
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,520
for example we we're interested in U

456
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,840
combustion of

457
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,399
methane or the combustion of iso

458
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:46,480
octane ISO octane is sort of close to

459
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:49,600
gasoline and methane is natural gas the

460
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,760
main component in natural gas so these

461
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,720
are important for energy

462
00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:00,360
uh applications as you

463
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:04,600
know so in order to right this

464
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,799
uh this is the uh the representation of

465
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,760
the complete

466
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,559
combustion uh so the simplest model for

467
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,679
for oxidation of the fuel complete

468
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:16,960
oxidation of the

469
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,640
fuel and uh so the stochiometric

470
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,360
coefficients are minus one minus two +

471
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,480
one plus two then you pick from this

472
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,000
table the vales of values of the

473
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,480
enthalpies of of formation so for

474
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,159
example you look for CH4 which is

475
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:39,039
methane is some here minus

476
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:43,600
74.9 so that's where where you get this

477
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:47,200
number the uh ele the elemental

478
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,559
species have no Rea no value for the

479
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,799
property of formation zero for them so

480
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,720
you can recognize them here they these

481
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,000
are the elemental

482
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:03,200
species hydrogen nitrogen molecular

483
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,919
oxygen so so you get zero then you have

484
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:12,159
CO2 so you look for

485
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:15,960
CO2 which is uh here minus 390

486
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,919
393.7 and then you get water which is

487
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,279
here at the bottom

488
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,080
242 and you can

489
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:27,440
calculate

490
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:32,279
this these numbers are in mega per kilom

491
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,960
or you or say kilj per mole and if you

492
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:40,480
divide by the molecular

493
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:46,399
weight for methane is 16 you get U this

494
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,399
number negative 50 megga per

495
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,480
kilogram for

496
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,279
isotine it's a much higher molecular

497
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,640
weight so mole wise it's a much higher

498
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:03,600
um um

499
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:06,559
um enthalpy of

500
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,039
reaction uh that's because you have many

501
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,120
more bonds to break per

502
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:14,799
molecule but if you divide by the

503
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,960
molecular weight you get a number which

504
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,039
is of the same very close same order of

505
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,080
magnitude as this one and actually this

506
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,880
turns out to be true for all

507
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,520
hydrocarbons yeah I don't I thought I

508
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,399
had it in the next slide we don't just

509
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,399
will come up in a

510
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,279
moment okay

511
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,000
uh so

512
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:44,600
negative means that the reaction is

513
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,159
exothermic and we'll we will see now

514
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,840
what the sign of these properties imply

515
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,720
in

516
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,519
determining the

517
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,080
direction of

518
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,080
spontaneous uh evolution of the reaction

519
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,640
so let's

520
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:10,440
take the steady state reactor set

521
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,440
up and let's assume that we

522
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:19,200
want H the reaction to occur at constant

523
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,320
temperature and and pressure meaning

524
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,960
that the inlet uh flows and the outlet

525
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,360
flows are going to be kept at the same

526
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,120
temperature and pressure

527
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,120
and this is going to be done with the

528
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,360
heat

529
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,440
interaction at some temperature

530
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,320
TQ for this moment for this

531
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,600
slide this temperature of the reservoir

532
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,159
is not necessarily the same

533
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,320
temperature of the inlet and at which

534
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,320
you want the reactor to

535
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,880
operate okay we

536
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,200
do our energy balance and our entropy

537
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,080
balance

538
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,039
bance we combine them

539
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,360
by

540
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:11,000
eliminating uh Q

541
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,760
Dot and here's the outcome it gives the

542
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,200
entropy production by IR reversibility

543
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,200
multiplied by TQ the temperature of the

544
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,799
heat Source or say heat bath or heat

545
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:29,360
reservoir termal reservoir whatever you

546
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:32,399
want to call it uh is equal to

547
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,080
minus Epsilon dot which is the

548
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,960
reaction

549
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,519
rate the rate of the reaction

550
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,840
coordinate times this combination of the

551
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:49,039
enthalpy and the entropy of

552
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,559
reaction which looks like the same kind

553
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,880
of combination that we have

554
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:59,840
in uh available energy or actually

555
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:04,080
exergy if you look back into when we did

556
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,760
a review of exergies in bu flow uh the

557
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,320
difference in enthalpy minus the

558
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,279
temperature of the res times the

559
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,120
difference in uh the entropies between

560
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:14,080
Inlet and outlet that is the exergy of

561
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,960
your

562
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,840
flows so this is the

563
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:25,519
exergy related to the exergy difference

564
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:29,120
between the products and the

565
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:30,919
reactants with respect to that uh

566
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,360
Reservoir at temperature

567
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,519
TQ now when Epsilon

568
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,600
dot is

569
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,080
positive the reaction is forward it

570
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,720
means that uh

571
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:51,000
uh it it is it's proceeding into

572
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,440
producing products consuming

573
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,880
reactants

574
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,039
okay so this the fact that of course

575
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,440
entropy cannot

576
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:06,360
cannot be destroyed so uh that this has

577
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:08,240
to have a always positive sign if it has

578
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,399
to really

579
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,760
occur gives you a a Criterion to decide

580
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,399
whether the reaction will be forward or

581
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,519
backward at that temperature because you

582
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:21,559
want if you want it forward you you need

583
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,919
Epsilon dot to be

584
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,480
positive so in order if that that's

585
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:28,120
positive in order for this to be

586
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,519
positive you need that you need this

587
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,519
linear combination to be uh

588
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:39,840
negative so in this table you can

589
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:43,200
summarize the possibilities so if uh if

590
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,720
you want that to be

591
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,279
positive and you want it to be positive

592
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,559
at

593
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,919
all combinations you certainly make you

594
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,559
could make sure that this that the

595
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,200
enthalpy of reaction is negative so that

596
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,320
is an exothermic reaction

597
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,240
and

598
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,000
also that this term doesn't influence

599
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,399
the sign of the overall linear

600
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,720
combination so you want so certainly if

601
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:16,360
the entropy of reaction is positive

602
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,639
you're safe because this also gives a

603
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,440
negative contribution you're also safe

604
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:27,440
if it is negative but not too

605
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,120
negative okay because this will this

606
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,480
with the minor sign in front if it is

607
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,799
negative it would be positive it

608
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,399
eventually could um could cancel out the

609
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,639
negativeness of the enthalpy uh and so

610
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:48,320
you could you could reverse uh the fact

611
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:52,360
which happens uh if if this uh is not

612
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,000
satisfied or actually if this is

613
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,399
satisfied okay so you see these

614
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,720
properties of reaction gives you the key

615
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:03,080
to understand whether uh uh the reaction

616
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,919
will go in the direction you want

617
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,080
because typically

618
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:13,320
you you you bother uh constructing

619
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,679
reactors because you want to uh have a

620
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,200
consume some products in order some

621
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,840
reactants in order to produce some

622
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
products that you

623
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,880
want now

624
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:32,480
if we repeat the same

625
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:36,919
but with the same

626
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,559
temperature as uh so so the the heat

627
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,120
bath or the thermal Reservoir has the

628
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:45,000
same temperature at which the reaction

629
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:49,480
occurs so when you have your reaction

630
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,679
for example placed in a calorimeter or

631
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,600
in a

632
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:58,600
thermostat uh so it's a thermostated

633
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:01,399
reaction at constant pressure

634
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,360
again and this pressure is the the

635
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:06,760
atmospheric pressure again your balance

636
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,800
equations it's exactly like before only

637
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,760
the T Q now is becoming equal to T and

638
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,839
then this

639
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,200
makes this linear

640
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,800
combination is the Gibs free energy of

641
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,200
reaction because H minus

642
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,119
TS is the Gibs free

643
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,760
energy so this is uh

644
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:33,399
why we typically say that the reaction

645
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:38,040
occurs in the direction of of uh

646
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:41,159
negative uh gives free energy yes you

647
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,399
need uh the GES free energy of reaction

648
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:46,879
to be negative in order to the Epsilon

649
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,879
dot to be uh

650
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,720
positive

651
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,480
however this depends on temperature

652
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,640
because the GS free energy is a function

653
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,640
of

654
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,560
temperature and in actually uh in the

655
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,760
next slide we will prove this relation

656
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,960
here that the the way the gift free

657
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,160
energy changes in temperature is this

658
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:20,359
way is related to the enthalpy of the

659
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,920
reaction so the rate of uh change of the

660
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:28,040
G free energy divided by

661
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,040
RT with respect to temperature

662
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,359
is equal to the enthalpy of reaction

663
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,359
divided by RT

664
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:43,599
s this is the that

665
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:47,800
relation and that is the proof the proof

666
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,839
comes from an old friend of ours which

667
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,599
is this relation that gives the enthalpy

668
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:54,680
in terms of the chemical potential for

669
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,400
the pure substance the chemical

670
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,520
potential is gives free energy if you go

671
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,400
back in your notes you find this

672
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,000
relation and if you put it inside here

673
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,359
uh out

674
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,560
comes this

675
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,560
thing this

676
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:21,079
plot has here it plots

677
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:24,040
versus this is not temperature it's it's

678
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:28,640
one over T it's a 1/ t scale so actually

679
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:31,200
the scale is here is 10 4 over t

680
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,640
so it's a one / T

681
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,440
scale which is precisely the thing we

682
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,880
respect with doing the

683
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,520
derivative and uh this axis instead

684
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:46,040
shows Delta G over T over

685
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:50,040
RT

686
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:54,800
it's the yeah there is the the logarithm

687
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,800
of of 10 because this is done on

688
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,520
a this is the log of

689
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,800
nerian log instead of log of 10 but

690
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,520
apart from this

691
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,079
Factor

692
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:16,680
uh this shows the dependence of Delta G

693
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:21,400
/ T versus 1 /t it's almost

694
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,400
linear and the this these

695
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:29,520
slopes the slopes are represented by the

696
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,520
negative of the

697
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,720
um of

698
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,720
the enthalpy of

699
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,040
reaction so for the exothermic reaction

700
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,240
this is positive so you see these ones

701
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,880
ones that go up are the exothermic

702
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:54,000
reaction for example co+

703
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:59,280
one2 is CO2 or water is here H2 plus

704
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:05,520
half O2 is H2O and so on

705
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:08,400
and you see that uh so if this is

706
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,520
uh positive because the relation that we

707
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,400
proved the previous slide was that the

708
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:18,160
entropy produced by

709
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:20,480
reversibility uh divided by uh the

710
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,480
reaction

711
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,480
rate so if this is positive that is also

712
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,480
positive you need this number to be

713
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:35,880
positive so from here

714
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:37,839
up you have all uh product favored

715
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,960
reactions but for

716
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:45,200
each uh reaction for even the uh that of

717
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,440
formation of of water if you go

718
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,640
sufficiently high in

719
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,480
temperature and as I go down in high in

720
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,640
temperature means one overt goes down so

721
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,920
if I go down here eventually I will find

722
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:05,079
the temperature

723
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,079
for water is of the order of what maybe

724
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:12,319
5,000 uh

725
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,680
K it becomes negative so it becomes uh

726
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:17,839
reactant

727
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:23,520
favored so water dissociates instead of

728
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:28,280
okay and the same is for True for

729
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,960
CO2 CO2 also dissociates at higher

730
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,240
temperature high

731
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,319
temperatures

732
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:41,520
okay this of course is important because

733
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:45,200
if combustion we do uh it's true that

734
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,560
the oxidation of a fuel produces CO2 and

735
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,119
water but if you are very high in

736
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,440
temperature like in an adiabatic flame

737
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,079
setup like the one we will consider at

738
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,920
the moment uh the temperatures are so

739
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:03,920
high

740
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:08,720
that U the reaction that uh that CO2 and

741
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,720
even water a little part

742
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:17,079
dissociates and of course if it

743
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:20,960
dissociates it consumes some some energy

744
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:24,960
in order to break those bonds that are

745
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,960
particularly stable

746
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,000
another

747
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:38,280
setup that is important is precisely the

748
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:43,280
adiabatic setup in which we have a

749
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:47,160
reactor uh which is insulated so no heat

750
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:51,160
no work interaction just uh just the

751
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:53,720
reaction itself makes things

752
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:58,119
happen and this time of course you

753
00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:00,560
cannot have the same uh temperature uh

754
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,839
of the outlet so in the outlet you'll

755
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,079
have a different temperature of the

756
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,079
products and we call it t add for

757
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,319
adiabatic of

758
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:16,040
course you have to write an energy

759
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,520
balance and the energy balance this time

760
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,839
will be simply that

761
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,720
the the net of the enthalpy coming

762
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:27,480
coming in with this bulk flow must be

763
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,319
equal to the enthalpy going out with the

764
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,960
Outlet bu

765
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:35,640
flow so this must be equal to so this

766
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,640
gives you one

767
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,000
relation that allows you to solve for

768
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,400
the diabatic

769
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,240
temperature ad diabatic product

770
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:50,240
temperature and once you solve for that

771
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,240
you go into the entropy

772
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:58,040
balance and that uh allows you to

773
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,040
compute this difference

774
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,000
and you can write this uh s do

775
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,920
irreversible one way

776
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,480
is to write it this uh

777
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,599
way

778
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,599
um I don't I yes here it is

779
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:26,119
um yeah you you essentially uh add a

780
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,920
zero you add the entropy balance I sorry

781
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,760
the energy balance which is zero so you

782
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
can add it it doesn't change the entropy

783
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:40,480
balance and you multiply the uh entropy

784
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,079
balance by T so that it becomes uh

785
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,760
dimensionally an

786
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:50,800
energy and then what what you get you

787
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,480
can split the outcome as two parts one

788
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,520
is our familiar Gibs free energy of

789
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,119
reaction term multiplied by the Epsilon

790
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,119
Dot

791
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:07,119
and these other uh terms are essentially

792
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:10,559
they're written here are essentially the

793
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,920
in the difference in the exergy of your

794
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:17,760
products at this

795
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,119
temperature from the reactant I'm sorry

796
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:25,960
sorry take it back uh it's the

797
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:29,400
difference between the exer that the

798
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:33,240
products have have at this

799
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,040
temperature you see this is still p

800
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:40,599
uh and the

801
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,559
um and that they have a temperature uh

802
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,920
of the

803
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:45,520
reactants so it's a difference between t

804
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,440
add and

805
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,040
T of

806
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,040
the xergy of your

807
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,319
products and so so you see if you

808
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:07,760
want the reaction to occur in that

809
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,760
direction you need Delta G to be

810
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:15,800
negative but it must be negative enough

811
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:15,800
to overcome this xergy

812
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:24,960
here and this

813
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:29,000
xergy is what will be uh you could um

814
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,480
deploy uh in application for example

815
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,880
in if this is high temperature you could

816
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:38,079
use it to

817
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:42,119
run the heat exchanger of of a thermal

818
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,119
cycle to produce electricity and so

819
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,839
on we will do the calculation for for

820
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:56,559
fuels

821
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:58,599
um again another setup is the exergy

822
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,599
kind of

823
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,599
discussion

824
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:08,680
here we still we use a TQ as a different

825
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,520
temperature as the temperature at which

826
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,520
you want your reaction to

827
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,040
occur and you assume also that this I

828
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,880
shouldn't really call it a reactor but

829
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,440
it's a reactor that is going to be part

830
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,400
of some more complex system that

831
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,200
contains also Machinery thermal Cycles

832
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,760
whatever you want in order to produce

833
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,480
some work so this is like a a box which

834
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,480
could be a power

835
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:38,839
plant that takes

836
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:42,240
in reactants produces your products it

837
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:45,599
could be a materials processing

838
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,640
plant that Tak in raw materials and

839
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,079
produces your uh material you you desire

840
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,720
to con

841
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:57,280
to to

842
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,559
manufacture okay now in some cases you

843
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,960
do right usual the energy and entropy

844
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:06,079
balance and you compute now the

845
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:10,000
work so the

846
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:11,720
work in some cases depending on the

847
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,960
conditions and the values of these

848
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,760
properties of

849
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,319
reaction sometimes you can do

850
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,599
work and the maximum work you can do is

851
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,240
given by

852
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,839
this and if you have entropy produced by

853
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,040
reversibility that will detract from the

854
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,520
maximum you can do so your actual work

855
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,599
will be less than the maximum because

856
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,200
there is a minus sign

857
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:37,920
here

858
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,440
sometimes you cannot extract work but

859
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,559
you actually need to spend work in order

860
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,760
to make that uh

861
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,559
occur this is the

862
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,559
minimum work you need to

863
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,520
spend and if you have irreversibility

864
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,359
that will detract and it will now this

865
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,599
sign becomes plus and it will add up to

866
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,359
the minimum so you will have you in

867
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,200
practice will you spend more work than

868
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,200
the minimum

869
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,760
requirement

870
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:23,800
okay so let's do something more specific

871
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:28,839
specific

872
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,839
about the oxidation of hydro

873
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,640
carbons In This Very

874
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:41,440
simplified view in which we consider the

875
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:45,000
overall basic uh reaction mechanism of

876
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,760
complete oxidation of the hydrocarbon as

877
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,319
if uh there were only that one which is

878
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,200
not

879
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:57,520
true but in this simplified view you

880
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,599
already can do a lot of uh interesting

881
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,599
uh considerations and

882
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,319
calculations first of

883
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,240
all you notice

884
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:10,839
that the mechanism involves involves the

885
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,280
fuel

886
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:18,319
hydrocarbon K is the number of

887
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:20,200
carbon nuclei in the molecule and L is

888
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,680
the number of

889
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:27,160
hydrogen uh nuclei in the

890
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:31,319
molecule you need oxygen

891
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:35,400
and the two main products of are CO2 and

892
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:37,839
water and that's the balanced

893
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,160
uh stochiometric

894
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:43,520
coefficients

895
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,920
typically when you burn a fuel like this

896
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,440
you don't do it in pure oxygen although

897
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,400
you could do oxy

898
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,920
combustion but you do it in you you use

899
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:58,040
air as an

900
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,040
oxidant and so um

901
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:05,319
oxygen is only one is going to be only

902
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:06,400
one of the uh components in the mixture

903
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:09,079
of your

904
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,920
oxidant the mole fraction of oxygen in

905
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,920
air is about

906
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:22,400
21% so if you want one mole of oxygen to

907
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:24,040
to to be available for your fuel you

908
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,920
need

909
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,839
um these divided by so one over these is

910
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,720
like

911
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:35,680
477 moles of

912
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:39,000
air and that therefore the

913
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,960
stochiometric amount that you need since

914
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,880
for one mole of of fuel you need K plus

915
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:53,480
L4 l l over four molecules of oxygen

916
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:57,680
that means 4.77 times this uh of air so

917
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,680
this gives the stochiometric

918
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,680
air fuel ratio the S stands for stoom

919
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:09,599
metric and if

920
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:13,280
you are more interested in weight uh

921
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:16,200
fractions this is the air to fuel

922
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,839
ratio Mass wise you have to multiply by

923
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:23,119
the molecular weight of air and divide

924
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:23,119
by the molecular weight of the fuel

925
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:35,160
also if you need to completely burn your

926
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,559
fuel you want to make sure that if you

927
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,190
have combustion

928
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,160
application uh

929
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:46,359
[Music]

930
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:49,040
the you don't leave unburned unburnt

931
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:51,960
hydrocarbons

932
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,880
around so for example you think of if

933
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,880
you think of a combustion chamber in the

934
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,359
internal combustion engine

935
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,000
yeah it's loaded with

936
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:03,440
fuel uh and you have the molecules of

937
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,079
fuel spread around in the combustion

938
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,520
chamber and if your air is just a sto

939
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,280
stochiometric

940
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,040
amount uh chances are that the last

941
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,799
molecule of fuel will be on one side and

942
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,640
last molecule of oxygen on the other

943
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:22,160
side and they will not encounter so you

944
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,160
you you miss that uh uh and So you

945
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,000
you're going to have some unburnt fuel

946
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:30,960
so for this reason you provide extra air

947
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
extra oxygen you provide some excess

948
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:38,240
air so the the actual fuel air ratio

949
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,680
that you use is U more than the

950
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,839
stochiometric amount and the ratio of

951
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:47,359
what you actually put over the stoom

952
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:47,359
matric is called equivalence

953
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:03,119
ratio we talked about the heating values

954
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:06,680
of fuels being in the range more or less

955
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:09,720
in the range and now hopefully yeah okay

956
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,720
here is the

957
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:13,559
list for the various

958
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,000
hydrocarbons

959
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:27,319
with um molecular weights that range

960
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:32,200
from two of hydrogen to 16 of uh methane

961
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:36,720
114 of iso Octane and

962
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:39,079
up and you see that the uh enthalpy of

963
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:42,680
reaction Except for hydrogen which is

964
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:44,799
much higher or for carbon which is lower

965
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:48,640
in terms of megga per kilogram the

966
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:52,760
others are all in the range between 40

967
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:56,559
this one but between 44 and 48 more or

968
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,559
less 50 for methane

969
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:02,440
and also you could compute the uh

970
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,200
entropies notice that the

971
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,640
entropy um of

972
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,400
reaction of

973
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,640
combustion uh is not does not

974
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:17,040
necessarily have to have a positive sign

975
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,040
some for some fuels it's

976
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,240
negative what's important for the

977
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,280
application and you have already used it

978
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,119
in in your homework is that the

979
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,760
difference

980
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,760
between the enthalpy and the Gibs free

981
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:39,839
energy is small percent wise percentage

982
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,440
wise in terms of the Gibs free

983
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:46,720
energy which is related to the exergy of

984
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,880
of the

985
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,960
fuel uh you see that this ratio is

986
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:57,079
between plus and

987
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,079
minus uh 2.4%

988
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:04,839
so this allows you for for for simple

989
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,520
calculations to neglect the difference

990
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:09,200
and say that the exergy of the fuel

991
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:13,760
which is the G three energy minus the G

992
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:16,400
three energy is uh almost equal to the

993
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,960
uh lower heating value of the fuel which

994
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,960
is the

995
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:26,000
enthalpy these other

996
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:27,079
table provides more specific uh values

997
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,480
for

998
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:33,079
uh heating

999
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:40,520
values and also the air fuel

1000
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:40,520
stomatic uh ratios for some practical

1001
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:51,480
fuels and introduces to the idea that uh

1002
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:55,640
uh heating values with as you

1003
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:57,000
know if you if you buy a a burner for

1004
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,200
your house

1005
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,599
you have to deal with

1006
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:05,599
the salesperson that gives you

1007
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,920
efficiencies and sometime most most of

1008
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,559
the times the deficiencies are based on

1009
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:16,559
the U lower heating

1010
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:19,160
value but nowadays they are send they're

1011
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,880
selling uh a lot of

1012
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:26,520
condensing

1013
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:30,520
burners where they exploit also uh the

1014
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:32,760
uh heat of condensation of the water

1015
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,839
that is in the products of

1016
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,359
combustion and therefore the proper

1017
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:40,039
reference for computing efficiencies

1018
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:42,079
there would be like the higher heating

1019
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:43,520
value sometimes they play with this

1020
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,000
difference because that difference can

1021
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,079
be large for example for natural

1022
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,280
gas it's about

1023
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:55,000
10% which is not an

1024
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,240
unimportant

1025
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,240
amount so

1026
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:06,119
why where does that difference come from

1027
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,960
so we have to distinguish between lower

1028
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:13,920
and higher heating values and uh and we

1029
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:16,559
have to therefore consider how much of

1030
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,200
the water that is present in the

1031
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,200
products of

1032
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:26,119
combustion

1033
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:26,119
uh condenses

1034
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:41,319
now the setup here is the setup of

1035
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:46,200
U Raul's

1036
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:48,440
law we are at pressure

1037
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:54,200
p we

1038
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:56,799
have uh water vapor plus let's call it

1039
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:59,079
uh two

1040
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:01,880
um the other products of

1041
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:06,160
combustion and water vapor is the one

1042
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:12,079
that can condense that can that

1043
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,079
condenses at least part of it at a given

1044
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:20,200
temperature and of course we

1045
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:24,240
have dealt with this problem and we uh

1046
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:30,240
we Pro the routs law that the routs law

1047
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:34,280
tells you what is the uh amount of water

1048
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,559
vapor that is in the gases phase when

1049
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,280
there is

1050
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:42,319
equilibrium with a liquid phase

1051
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:46,000
and there cannot be

1052
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:49,920
more water vapor here so that amount

1053
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,359
given by the RS law is the

1054
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:57,680
maximum that can be uh dissolved or or

1055
00:57:54,359 --> 00:58:01,440
dissolved in the gaseous phase

1056
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:04,880
uh if you have less in instead less that

1057
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,880
than that amount then there is no

1058
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:15,359
condensation it's like for a it's like

1059
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:19,920
for today today we have rain so that

1060
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:24,000
means that moist a has more water than

1061
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,520
it can uh uh stay there and therefore we

1062
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,520
got we get it drops condensates and then

1063
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,720
we get

1064
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:34,880
rain uh on a dry uh drier uh

1065
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:37,880
day there is less water vapor and it's

1066
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:41,400
below the threshold for

1067
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:44,280
condensation so this is all in this

1068
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,920
expression here where of course it's R's

1069
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:51,599
law with uh the mole fraction in the

1070
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,359
liquid phase equal to one because we

1071
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,680
assume that this liquid phase is just

1072
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,039
pure water not salt to dissolve the

1073
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,039
other things

1074
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,640
okay all right so ral's law gives us the

1075
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,720
maximum so the actual amount is called

1076
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,680
the relative the Rel I mean the the

1077
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,400
actual amount divided by the maximum is

1078
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,839
called the relative

1079
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,920
humidity relative to the maximum that

1080
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:20,160
you can uh

1081
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,880
dissolve and the saturation uh pressure

1082
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,720
is that of pure water and at the

1083
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:31,920
standard temperature 25 C that pressure

1084
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,920
is about 3 17

1085
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:40,960
atmospheres so you see that uh you

1086
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:43,799
by taking the pressure down here so you

1087
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,079
can this is about three atmospheres

1088
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:49,319
divided by

1089
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:52,760
101 which is atmospheric pressure this

1090
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:55,760
ratio is equal to the maximum so the

1091
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,920
maximum this instead of Y 1 s should be

1092
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,720
one

1093
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,880
gmax uh

1094
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,880
is uh

1095
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:13,000
3% so out of out of 100 moles of stuff

1096
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,760
in the product of combustion at most

1097
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,039
three can be water

1098
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:23,000
molecules if you have more your

1099
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:27,680
combustion reaction produces more water

1100
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,880
then the extra will uh condense

1101
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:34,280
so if you do the inventory for

1102
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:37,599
water this is the amount produced by the

1103
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:39,760
your reaction in your reaction yeah so

1104
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:42,880
in the products that's the

1105
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:45,920
amount some of it remains in the gaseous

1106
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,400
phase some of it goes into the liquid

1107
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,400
phase it

1108
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:55,119
condenses and the stochiometry tells you

1109
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:58,799
that per unit amount of fuel the amount

1110
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:01,839
of water produced is L over2 so this L

1111
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:06,960
over2 will be split into partly

1112
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,960
condensed and partly um water

1113
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,160
vapor the mole

1114
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:21,240
fraction in the water

1115
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:25,039
vapor is defined as the amount of water

1116
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:29,240
that is remained in the vapor phase

1117
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:32,640
divided by the the overall amount in the

1118
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:35,039
vapor phase and so the overall amount is

1119
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:38,079
the overall products of

1120
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:40,119
combustion minus the water that is

1121
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:43,039
condensed so it went away from the the

1122
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:46,520
gases phas so this is the m fraction and

1123
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:50,119
the total amount is given by this sto

1124
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:55,000
sto so if you combine all

1125
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:59,400
that you get uh that the maximum amount

1126
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,480
of uh water that uh can stay in the

1127
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:05,000
gases phase is limited by this

1128
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,480
combination of the Ln case that describe

1129
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,960
how many carbons and hydrogens you have

1130
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,680
in the fuel

1131
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:16,119
molecule and when you have condensation

1132
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,440
which happens when L over K is greater

1133
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:21,520
than

1134
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,520
04 this is the amount that

1135
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:27,839
condenses okay so if that amount condens

1136
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,799
it

1137
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:36,319
releases the

1138
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:40,039
enthalpy of vaporization of

1139
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:43,039
water and that enters into your

1140
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:43,039
balance

1141
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:56,160
equation and so the the the

1142
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:58,680
heat that you need to uh

1143
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,319
when you compute when you compute uh the

1144
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,720
the heating value at standard uh

1145
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:09,079
temperature you're actually making a a

1146
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:11,520
an experiment in which you have your

1147
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:14,720
reactants

1148
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:19,200
gone come in at the

1149
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:23,480
STP produce your products and you need

1150
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:26,720
to put some uh uh heat

1151
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:30,720
out at temperature t no

1152
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:32,279
so as to cool the products down again to

1153
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,359
this temperature here so that's the

1154
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:38,000
setup in which you measure this

1155
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:41,200
value

1156
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,680
and and this is the entropy balance I'm

1157
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,240
sorry the energy balance that is that

1158
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,240
defines per unit so the amount of heat

1159
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,880
that you have to extract per unit of

1160
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:55,960
amount of fuel that you have uh burnt in

1161
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:59,200
that um experimental setup is the

1162
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,839
heating the the actual heating

1163
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,359
value and part of it is equal to the

1164
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:06,559
negative of the enthalpy of

1165
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:12,279
reaction and part of

1166
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:15,720
it is due to the um condens

1167
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:18,240
condensation um

1168
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:21,039
enthalpy

1169
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,160
okay so if you do the calculation for

1170
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,640
example for

1171
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:28,960
methane the value is in megga per

1172
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,799
kilogram

1173
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:36,359
54.7 if you neglect this

1174
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:36,359
condensation it's only

1175
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:43,880
50.1 and the Other Extreme is if you

1176
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:46,079
want to have a even quicker calculation

1177
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:49,799
and forget about

1178
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,520
uh um the amount of water that remains

1179
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:55,200
in the gaseous phase and assume that

1180
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:58,480
everything every single molecule of

1181
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:01,920
water that has been produced condenses

1182
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,440
then you put l over2 here and you get

1183
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,880
what is called the higher heating

1184
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:11,440
volume uh it's

1185
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:14,039
55.5 okay so there is heating value and

1186
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,119
heating values and they actual the lower

1187
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:19,000
if you neglect condensation and the

1188
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:22,000
higher is you a bit overestimate

1189
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
condensation

1190
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:38,440
so this reactor that we uh just

1191
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:41,039
considered it's represented again here

1192
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,039
and in this

1193
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,599
setup with this

1194
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:50,480
setup we can consider

1195
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:53,240
three possible cases the one is the

1196
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:56,160
heating value the one that we just uh uh

1197
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:59,319
did

1198
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:02,720
in which there is no

1199
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:07,319
work and you set the outlet temperature

1200
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,520
of the few of the products uh to be uh

1201
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:13,119
standard like the

1202
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:16,960
inlet in this setup that

1203
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:19,599
defines U the combination that um from

1204
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:24,240
which you measure the heating

1205
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:31,240
value the exergy setup the exergy of the

1206
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:38,279
fuel is what one in which again you have

1207
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:41,160
the products out at um atmospheric um

1208
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:45,359
or standard

1209
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:48,520
temperature but your reactor has some

1210
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:51,520
system inside that allows you to extract

1211
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:54,000
work and actually does it

1212
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,260
reversibly okay so if you do it

1213
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,400
reversibly so you set uh

1214
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:00,319
[Music]

1215
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,680
um you in order to obtain the maximum

1216
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:04,920
work you set the entropy produced by

1217
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:08,240
reversibility equal to zero in your

1218
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:11,799
entropy balance and the outcome is this

1219
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:15,599
one and the exergy of the

1220
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:20,520
fuel turns out to be equal to the

1221
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,520
negative of the Gibs free energy at

1222
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:26,359
STP and notice that in this calculation

1223
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,920
see while here you only have the

1224
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:36,880
enthalpy difference and in the enthalpy

1225
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:39,559
difference then you need to account for

1226
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,839
condensation here you have the enthalpy

1227
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:42,440
difference but also the entropy

1228
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:45,880
difference and they are multiplied by

1229
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:48,960
the temperature T not so one brings

1230
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:51,880
in the enthalpy of vaporization the

1231
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:56,240
other brings in the entropy vaporization

1232
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:56,240
and they are related to one another

1233
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:02,559
this uh for a pure substance you have

1234
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:05,680
this identity that

1235
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:09,599
hfg is equal to T

1236
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:11,520
sfg at every temperature because of the

1237
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,319
condition of mutual equilibrium between

1238
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,040
the liquid and the vapor so these two

1239
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:21,880
contributions cancel

1240
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:27,440
out so this Delta G negative does not

1241
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:27,440
have contributions from condensation

1242
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:35,000
so ex the condensation doesn't play a

1243
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
role in the exergy of the

1244
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:45,120
fuel uh if you want what I'm neglecting

1245
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:50,319
here uh

1246
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:52,600
is the

1247
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:56,679
mixing uh

1248
01:08:52,600 --> 01:09:00,719
entropy terms that are here depending on

1249
01:08:56,679 --> 01:09:04,799
how you put in your fuels certainly the

1250
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:08,279
air has is a mixture of oxygen and

1251
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:10,480
nitrogen sometimes you put in your fuel

1252
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:13,159
like premixed so

1253
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,719
you you mix the fuel with with with the

1254
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:18,400
air so you have a mixture and in the

1255
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:21,120
entropy balance you should consider the

1256
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:25,199
mixing terms and then also the products

1257
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:29,000
of combustion is a mixture and so you

1258
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:30,960
have entropy term so somehow these are

1259
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,759
approximations in which we are

1260
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:38,960
neglecting mixing

1261
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:42,960
entropies the final setup of this is one

1262
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:46,279
in which you compute the adiabatic flame

1263
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:48,600
temperature no heat no works just a

1264
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:52,120
adiabatic insulated

1265
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:56,279
reactor in which uh you just have this

1266
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,279
combustion reaction occur

1267
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,400
the energy

1268
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:05,719
balance is this one now the enalia of

1269
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:09,880
the products has to be computed at

1270
01:10:05,719 --> 01:10:13,760
temperature uh t t add T

1271
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,760
adiabatic we can add and

1272
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,560
subtract the enthalpy of the products

1273
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:23,040
standard temperature so that this

1274
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:26,040
difference here is the same that appears

1275
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:27,679
here in this other setup and we have

1276
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:31,239
already computed it it's the heating

1277
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:35,280
value times Epsilon Dot and this is just

1278
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:42,000
this sensible heat that is sensible yeah

1279
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:42,000
heat that is required to heat up the

1280
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,520
products uh from standard to adiabatic

1281
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,920
flame temperature and you can compute

1282
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:54,400
that by simply using the properties of

1283
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:57,239
an ideal gas um you can actually start

1284
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,239
even from

1285
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:04,520
um standard temperature even if even for

1286
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,679
water because because in the heating

1287
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:10,679
value which is on that part you assume

1288
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:14,199
that water is in the fictitious

1289
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:17,679
gaseous state so you can use those

1290
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:19,840
correlations for specific Heats and

1291
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:24,239
integrate of course this gives you an

1292
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:26,560
equation in which t u uh adiabatic is

1293
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,480
the only unknown

1294
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,760
and you can solve for

1295
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:34,440
it once you find

1296
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:36,159
it you can put it in the entropy balance

1297
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,560
also in the entropy balance which is

1298
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:41,280
this one entropy of the

1299
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:43,920
outlet uh is greater than that of the

1300
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,520
inlet and the difference is the entropy

1301
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,719
produced by irreversibility you can add

1302
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:56,159
and subtract the uh entropy of the

1303
01:11:49,719 --> 01:12:01,360
products at standard conditions and uh

1304
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:04,840
and uh so this last difference is is

1305
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:07,719
equal to the entropy of the

1306
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:10,800
reaction times the reaction

1307
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:13,840
coordinate and this initial difference

1308
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:18,000
is the uh you can obtain by integrating

1309
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,000
the formulas for an ideal gas

1310
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,360
mixture when you do this kind of

1311
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,199
calculations and least we have a couple

1312
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:29,320
of tables that show these

1313
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:33,440
numbers uh later

1314
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:35,159
on you you compute the entropy of this

1315
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:40,360
typical

1316
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:40,360
values are in the range between 26 and

1317
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:48,480
30% of the negative of the G en so of so

1318
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:51,920
if you take T not and put it on the

1319
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:55,239
other side T not Time s reversible is

1320
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,719
the waste of

1321
01:12:55,239 --> 01:13:03,280
exergy destruction is the uh the source

1322
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:08,440
of inefficiency of your system and that

1323
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:11,760
is equal to uh is is equal to about 26

1324
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:13,040
30% of the exergy of the fuel so that

1325
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,760
means

1326
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:20,320
that uh by burning your fuel in a steady

1327
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:22,520
in a in a reactor like

1328
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:26,480
this you

1329
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:29,520
wasting about 25 to 30 % of the

1330
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,360
availability of the fuel without having

1331
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,960
consumed one

1332
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:37,960
single unit of

1333
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:41,760
energy okay and this is the if you

1334
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:44,360
remember the reason why uh I told you

1335
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:47,440
that U if we

1336
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:51,280
ever will follow history and uh we'll

1337
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:55,679
have power plants or production of

1338
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:58,520
electricity that will exceed our current

1339
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:01,239
65% of the best available

1340
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:05,960
technology uh we will have to find

1341
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:08,679
alternatives to burning fuels this way

1342
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:12,320
in diabatic

1343
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:14,520
Flames because we need to overcome this

1344
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,400
25% loss

1345
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:20,400
of

1346
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,400
efficiency of potential

1347
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,080
efficiency now have you seen in the

1348
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:31,800
previous uh slide we need to do those

1349
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:37,480
integrals to compute the enthalpy and

1350
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:41,280
the U uh entropy the difference for the

1351
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:44,600
product of combustion between the

1352
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:47,719
standard and adiabatic flame

1353
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:50,800
temperature one way to do that

1354
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:53,360
calculation uh this is just a detail but

1355
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,840
you can this you can find correlations

1356
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,440
for the specific Heats of the various

1357
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:02,199
substances and one

1358
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:04,320
way one correlation that is given in in

1359
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:07,679
the book and from which I

1360
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:11,000
have extracted some of these

1361
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:16,639
numbers uh this kind of correlation is

1362
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:20,760
is is able to cover um with a single

1363
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:22,239
correlation uh the range from standard

1364
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:25,600
to

1365
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:30,159
5,000k with very good approximation

1366
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:35,760
otherwise uh in um typical software uh

1367
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:39,080
they use uh they split the range with

1368
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:43,400
a with a a correlation that holds

1369
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:46,639
between standard that say 25 C and say a

1370
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:48,520
10000 K and another correlation from a

1371
01:15:46,639 --> 01:15:51,080
th000 so you have to split the integral

1372
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,080
into two

1373
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:58,960
parts the the thing that was uh into

1374
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,320
these integrals here you see it's the

1375
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,280
summation of the specific Heats of the

1376
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,719
various

1377
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:10,639
products weighted on the their mole

1378
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:13,080
fractions in the uh product uh stream

1379
01:16:10,639 --> 01:16:17,080
and also for the entropy is the same

1380
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:19,719
thing only divided by T so you need to

1381
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:22,560
compute this and with that kind of

1382
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:26,320
correlation you can do it simply because

1383
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:29,840
by using a correlation of a

1384
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,920
similar um fractional powers of the

1385
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,040
temperature with the coefficients that

1386
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,679
awaited some of the individual

1387
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:38,719
coefficients of the various molecules

1388
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:41,440
which to take from this uh and then also

1389
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,040
the integral of this fractional powers

1390
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:46,560
of temperature can be

1391
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:49,040
done explicitly so here's the result of

1392
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:52,080
this integral that's the result of that

1393
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,560
integral and so that is the actual

1394
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,280
expression that then you will have to

1395
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:58,199
solve

1396
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:03,400
uh uh numerically in order to obtain the

1397
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:06,080
diotic flame temperature from the energy

1398
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:10,120
balance I am mentioning these details

1399
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:12,480
because I'm not going to go uh over

1400
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:15,600
other details but in the past I have

1401
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:20,320
developed this Excel file that I

1402
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:22,880
will share with you on the on canvas

1403
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:26,120
just in case uh in the future you'll

1404
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:29,320
have to maybe teach a course like this

1405
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:31,480
and you may have your students play with

1406
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:34,159
these equations this

1407
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:36,400
a several sheets it allows you to

1408
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:40,120
compute to use all the equations that we

1409
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:44,840
have seen it allows you to compute for

1410
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:47,239
example the enthalpies versus entropy

1411
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:51,000
diagram uh

1412
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:55,880
for reactant and

1413
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,639
products it uh can allow you to ID

1414
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,400
identify

1415
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:02,239
uh uh for example in this case the

1416
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,320
temperature I assume the reactants are

1417
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:06,679
at

1418
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:09,800
700k and to compute the adiabatic flame

1419
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:12,440
temperature uh so the temperature of

1420
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:15,880
this other state for the products so you

1421
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,880
can play with this if you

1422
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:25,320
like of

1423
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:25,320
course we left it alone but uh

1424
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:33,800
we are not always working with the

1425
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:36,199
steady uh or steady state flow

1426
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:40,480
reactors uh often like in an internal

1427
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:43,480
combustion engine or in bombs uh not

1428
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:47,440
necessarily used for Wars you use bombs

1429
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:51,280
also to measure in the lab uh like the

1430
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:55,920
heating power of fuels or the

1431
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:58,239
um uh flame propagation rate

1432
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:01,679
uh uh

1433
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:05,840
so you have a close system set

1434
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:09,199
up and you can perform exactly the same

1435
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,480
uh reasoning that we have done so you

1436
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:13,639
the only difference is that you have to

1437
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,840
perform a volume

1438
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:18,760
balance and if you can assume that both

1439
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:22,840
the initial and

1440
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:26,159
final states are in the gases phase the

1441
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,520
ideal gas law gives you the volume

1442
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:31,960
and then if the volume remains constant

1443
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:34,520
like VP equals VR then you find that the

1444
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:38,719
ratio of the final temperature over the

1445
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:40,520
final pressure is equal to the

1446
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,719
initial uh

1447
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:46,000
ratio but there is also the ratio of NP

1448
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:46,000
over

1449
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:53,719
NR so for example for the heating value

1450
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,239
you could measure a heating value at

1451
01:19:53,719 --> 01:19:58,719
constant volume

1452
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:01,320
you would have no heat exchange you

1453
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:04,120
would have a I'm sorry no work

1454
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:06,800
exchange and you would have a heat

1455
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:10,840
exchange enough to bring your products

1456
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:13,639
down to the environmental temperature

1457
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:16,120
but you have to accept that since it's a

1458
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:20,679
closed volume setup the final pressure

1459
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:24,320
will not go down to uh

1460
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:25,239
um to atmospheric and it will be a

1461
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,400
pressure

1462
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:32,600
P that determined by the ideal gas law

1463
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,600
is determined by this

1464
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:43,560
thing okay so if you do

1465
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:47,760
the the energy

1466
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:49,280
balance you get the heating value and

1467
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,320
the heating

1468
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:54,639
value this time in this setup is equal

1469
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,360
not to the enthalpy but the internal

1470
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:59,360
energy of

1471
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,360
combustion

1472
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:07,960
plus uh the amount of uh energy that is

1473
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:12,320
involved in condensation and I presume

1474
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:17,480
that here I should change this into an A

1475
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:20,560
U that's the internal energy of uh

1476
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:23,760
condensation of of condensation and not

1477
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,760
the enthalpy

1478
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:34,880
or if you consider an adiabatic setup

1479
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:38,320
like a a true bomb set up where there is

1480
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:41,120
no work no

1481
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,360
heat this is the final pressure in terms

1482
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,239
of the final

1483
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:49,400
temperature and you compute the the

1484
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:52,360
final temperature by again the energy

1485
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:56,080
balance these times the only difference

1486
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:58,800
is that is instead of the uh specific

1487
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:02,120
Heats at constant pressure since the

1488
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:04,560
energy uh for a gas depends on the

1489
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:08,560
specific Heats at constant volume it's

1490
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,560
the CV that you have to integrate

1491
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:15,360
here and uh you can then compute the

1492
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:17,600
pressure once you have the temperature

1493
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,239
you can compute the pressure from here

1494
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,960
and then you can compute the entropy

1495
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:23,320
produced by reversibility with the

1496
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:27,920
entropy balance and you find that this

1497
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:31,960
time the uh loss of

1498
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:34,880
uh uh the exergy distruction so the loss

1499
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:37,679
of efficiency is a bit

1500
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,000
smaller well why well

1501
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:43,120
because because you are left with

1502
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,760
products that are in a container and are

1503
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:48,199
a very high pressure and that high

1504
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,400
pressure has some availability you could

1505
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:55,080
use it to expand and therefore to make

1506
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:59,159
work so that is a s of transformed

1507
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:01,480
uh part of the exergy of the fuel into

1508
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:05,080
that and that's

1509
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:06,719
why these are the numbers so here are

1510
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:10,480
numbers for a

1511
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,480
closed combustion

1512
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,480
chamber

1513
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,480
temperatures are very

1514
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:24,480
high and pressures of the order of 10

1515
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,480
atmospheres

1516
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:33,239
and here that ratio is indeed in the

1517
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,440
range that I said for the steady state

1518
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:37,840
uh flow

1519
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,719
burner the ad batic flame temperatures

1520
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,840
are

1521
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:46,120
lower and the uh

1522
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,120
irreversibility is

1523
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,440
higher actually these calculations

1524
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:11,280
are done not using simply the reaction

1525
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:15,159
of oxidation of the

1526
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:19,199
fuel but they're also using uh the other

1527
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:25,159
two reactions that of dissociation of

1528
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:29,000
CO2 and of H2O because those two react

1529
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:33,080
are important at high temperatures and

1530
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,840
are also energy uh intensive in the

1531
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:39,560
sense that they consume up some of the

1532
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:43,119
energy released by the combustion

1533
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:46,560
ruction and therefore they

1534
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:49,360
are important otherwise you if you

1535
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:54,280
neglect those you would get uh even

1536
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,280
higher values for the temperatures here

1537
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:04,679
and in the Excel file you'll find uh

1538
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:07,840
that some of the sheets you you you're

1539
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:10,440
neglecting this uh uh dissoci this

1540
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,239
dissociation of CO2 and H2O and some

1541
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:16,239
other sheets you find them that those

1542
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:19,520
are the ones what

1543
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:22,880
that where you also compute the

1544
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:24,800
equilibrium because we the moment we

1545
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:28,639
haven't done yet the next time we'll

1546
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:31,080
talk about chemical equilibrium and

1547
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:34,800
those reactions are assumed to be in

1548
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:34,800
chemical equilibrium at these

1549
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,840
temperatures so let's uh

1550
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:51,760
summarize for the

1551
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:55,679
closed uh system set

1552
01:25:51,760 --> 01:26:00,719
up what we have seen

1553
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,719
in this energy versus entropy uh

1554
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:08,520
diagram uh this is the curve that

1555
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,440
represents the stable equilibrium states

1556
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,000
of the

1557
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:16,000
reactants and this is the one that

1558
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
represents those of the

1559
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:24,800
products T not is this slope here which

1560
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:30,280
touches the reactant at this point so

1561
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:34,239
these are uh the reactant

1562
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:37,199
mixture so it would be your

1563
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:42,320
fuel including the air that you're using

1564
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:44,480
to oxidize the fuel at 25 C1 atmosphere

1565
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:47,520
it's in this state

1566
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:50,400
here and these are the

1567
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,440
products of

1568
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:55,880
reaction after you cool them down at

1569
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,400
standard condition

1570
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:01,719
is

1571
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:04,280
okay so the difference in

1572
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:06,280
energy between this and that is this

1573
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:09,560
blue

1574
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:11,600
arrows that's the

1575
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:14,719
energy of

1576
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:19,119
reaction and the difference in the

1577
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:21,040
entropies this Black Arrow here is the

1578
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:22,840
entropy of the

1579
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,880
reaction and

1580
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:27,639
again some

1581
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,520
sometimes this point will be to the left

1582
01:27:27,639 --> 01:27:32,560
of that one sometimes it for other fuels

1583
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,840
it will be on the right there's no

1584
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,159
fundamental reason why it should be left

1585
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,159
or

1586
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:44,320
right

1587
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:48,119
okay we start with the products I mean

1588
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:48,119
so with the reactants

1589
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:55,630
at um

1590
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:57,080
STP and we run

1591
01:27:55,630 --> 01:27:58,679
[Music]

1592
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:02,040
our

1593
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:04,239
adiabatic constant

1594
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,600
energy

1595
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:10,440
combustion adiabatic flame temperature

1596
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:14,000
set up so the energy remains constant

1597
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:16,880
and in the final State we end up

1598
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,119
here with this state with the

1599
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:22,960
temperature which is represented by this

1600
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:22,960
slope Which is higher

1601
01:28:26,679 --> 01:28:34,280
okay now talking about exit I mean yes

1602
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:36,159
available energies so let me call omega

1603
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:39,080
as we did in the initial part of the

1604
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:41,400
course Omega the available energy with

1605
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,239
respect to a res so the not up there

1606
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,719
means with respect to a reservoir at

1607
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:45,719
standard

1608
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:53,440
temperature so in any in any place of

1609
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:55,080
this diagram which uh you remember any

1610
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:58,840
point we can

1611
01:28:55,080 --> 01:29:00,880
compute uh the energy and the entropy uh

1612
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:02,600
this

1613
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:07,440
is

1614
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:11,360
uh the expression for the available

1615
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:13,639
energy energy minus the energy uh when

1616
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,800
the system is in mutual equilibrium with

1617
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:15,800
the

1618
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:24,360
Reser but now we have two options

1619
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:25,600
here one is with the off case

1620
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:28,199
no

1621
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:31,760
reactions so for no

1622
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:36,239
reactions the composition cannot change

1623
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:38,600
and so our reference State the the so

1624
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:42,719
the the reactants are in mutual

1625
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:45,239
equilibrium with our uh Reservoir at

1626
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:49,159
this state

1627
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:55,320
here so this is the state with energy u0

1628
01:29:49,159 --> 01:29:59,760
R and s0 R so it's here

1629
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:01,679
If instead we allow the chemical

1630
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:05,000
reactions then

1631
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:08,199
our the mutual

1632
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,520
equilibrium will with the reservoir uh

1633
01:30:08,199 --> 01:30:14,639
will be this one the most stable is when

1634
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:15,520
the product when the the products uh

1635
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:19,480
have

1636
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:23,400
occurred the reactions are have allowed

1637
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:26,239
to go to a more stable uh Mutual

1638
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:31,000
equilibrium which is this one the state

1639
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:35,320
at t0 of the products so I can

1640
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:38,280
compute of course this state has zero

1641
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:40,880
availability with respect to the off

1642
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:42,880
situation but with respect to the to the

1643
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,320
on situation so with the

1644
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:48,520
reactions it has an availability which

1645
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:52,119
is given by this blue uh line here so

1646
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:58,239
that's the available energy of the uh

1647
01:30:52,119 --> 01:31:01,400
Inlet State we respect to the uh Outlet

1648
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:01,400
state so to

1649
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:08,600
speak when I do the the the flame the

1650
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:09,719
diabatic combustion I end up with this

1651
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,840
state

1652
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:15,320
here and it's availability it's

1653
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:17,520
available energy you remember the

1654
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:21,320
construction you have to go down here

1655
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:23,920
geometrically until you you reach the

1656
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:26,000
line that has the slope of the temper

1657
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:30,239
tempure of the reservoir so this is the

1658
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:34,960
blue this is the U available energy it's

1659
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:35,880
less than in initial and uh uh what's

1660
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,639
what's

1661
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:42,239
missing is the amount of is related to

1662
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:45,119
the amount of entropy that you generated

1663
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:50,280
by reversibility if you look at this

1664
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:54,560
triangle this angle this tangent is

1665
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:57,360
t0 and so this uh

1666
01:31:54,560 --> 01:32:00,119
side of the triangle is equal to t0

1667
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:03,119
times this length which is s

1668
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:03,119
irreversible

1669
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:09,719
okay

1670
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:14,600
okay now sometimes well first

1671
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:14,600
observation here is that U these two

1672
01:32:14,679 --> 01:32:20,560
curves um approach each other as you go

1673
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:22,960
ey in uh in

1674
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,159
temperature so if we could have the

1675
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:30,119
combustion occur

1676
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:34,600
uh by preheating our U reactants at a

1677
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:37,679
higher temperature for example T t1r

1678
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:41,600
here when I do the

1679
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:43,880
oxidation the adiabatic flame I produce

1680
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:47,239
less entropy by reversibility and

1681
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:51,360
therefore I consume less

1682
01:32:47,239 --> 01:32:55,239
exg that increases the efficiency so

1683
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:58,119
preheating the reactants is a way to

1684
01:32:55,239 --> 01:33:00,400
improve the efficiency of course

1685
01:32:58,119 --> 01:33:03,600
preheating requires some some

1686
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:06,960
availability some available energy this

1687
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:10,560
much and this is the available energy of

1688
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:12,719
the heated reactants with respect to the

1689
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,800
reactants themselves we so this I'm

1690
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:17,560
using the

1691
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:22,320
off expression for the available

1692
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:24,280
energy and then when I have obtained

1693
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:26,199
these products

1694
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:29,280
of course at a higher

1695
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:33,080
temperature see T1

1696
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:34,199
Prime uh they have this much uh uh

1697
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:38,800
available

1698
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:41,199
energy and even if I pay off what I

1699
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:44,119
spent in order to do the

1700
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:47,480
preheating I'm still gaining in terms of

1701
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:52,560
the fact that if I of course if I do

1702
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:56,159
things uh reversibly uh I have less

1703
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,440
energy waste than exergy waste than in

1704
01:33:56,159 --> 01:34:00,280
the previous

1705
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:03,119
case

1706
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:07,199
and and the last observation is the

1707
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:11,199
following that okay well could we keep

1708
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:13,440
preheating and so get uh closer and

1709
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:18,000
closer this

1710
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:19,760
concept has been um so the question is

1711
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,679
is it

1712
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:25,560
possible to

1713
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:27,719
go to an extreme in which the two to

1714
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:31,159
where these two curves one of the

1715
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:32,600
reactants and the one of the products uh

1716
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:37,840
touch each

1717
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:39,639
other and they do at a certain

1718
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:43,719
temperature

1719
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:47,199
provided you do what you have to mix

1720
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:50,280
some of the products with your

1721
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:52,560
reactants in fact this is also done in

1722
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:55,159
internal combustion engines it's called

1723
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:58,560
ex exhaust gas

1724
01:34:55,159 --> 01:35:03,040
recirculation so you take some of the

1725
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:06,400
gases and mix them with the uh reactant

1726
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:08,520
mixture that makes these curves get

1727
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,840
closer to one another and therefore

1728
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:12,560
reduces the

1729
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:16,040
irreversibility and increases the

1730
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:21,480
efficiency of course if you do too

1731
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:24,600
much is this mixing involves an entropy

1732
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:28,000
of mixing so what you get

1733
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:33,320
by getting these two curves closed you

1734
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:36,840
lose uh in uh in the mixing entropy and

1735
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:36,840
that's also an

1736
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:44,000
irreversible these concepts of very

1737
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:49,679
theoretical of course then they you know

1738
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:52,360
Kenan uh has brought up this question in

1739
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:55,840
1940

1740
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,840
41 also so

1741
01:35:56,119 --> 01:36:06,159
alert 1948 and then also

1742
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:10,639
1973 and later on every 10 years or so

1743
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:13,000
people uh go back to this one I haven't

1744
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,320
been following so I don't know if the U

1745
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,400
frequency of 10 years is still respected

1746
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:19,880
but uh at least we we are talking about

1747
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,960
it now

1748
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:24,080
so

1749
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:25,679
um we ourselves

1750
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:29,600
you can you

1751
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:34,199
can go to this reference uh and we

1752
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:37,920
worked on some calculation and we

1753
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:39,960
computed the amount of u water that you

1754
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:45,080
have to

1755
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:48,679
dissolve uh in uh this was combustion of

1756
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:51,440
hydrogen and we wanted to look at what

1757
01:36:48,679 --> 01:36:54,119
dilution you should put in dilute your

1758
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:57,239
products of combustion uh

1759
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:59,560
which in this case is just water uh in

1760
01:36:57,239 --> 01:37:02,400
order for the temperature at which they

1761
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:05,560
touch not to be too high because if it

1762
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:07,159
is too high uh you see the problem here

1763
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:09,639
is that you you want to do the

1764
01:37:07,159 --> 01:37:13,239
preheating and while you're

1765
01:37:09,639 --> 01:37:15,239
preheating uh you should uh be able to

1766
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:17,000
contain the the reaction it should you

1767
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:20,040
should freeze the

1768
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,960
reaction and allow the reaction only so

1769
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:26,920
so to speak turn it on only when you are

1770
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:29,400
here then uh you turn it on and nothing

1771
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:32,840
happens because you the the reactants

1772
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:35,760
and products are in equilibrium but then

1773
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:39,320
as you cool down the products you you go

1774
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:42,719
down this curve so you you obtain uh

1775
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:44,960
more then uh you obtain the exergy

1776
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,040
essentially of of the fuel with respect

1777
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,719
to this

1778
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:54,040
one so in the preheating you spend this

1779
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:56,760
exergy and in the uh cooling down of the

1780
01:37:54,040 --> 01:38:01,760
products you obtain this energy and the

1781
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:04,480
difference is the exergy of of the fuel

1782
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:07,880
uh but the problem in practice is that

1783
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:10,440
as you go above a certain temperature

1784
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:13,320
any uh mixture will have a self

1785
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:15,360
combustion and autocombustion limit and

1786
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:19,480
it will burn by

1787
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:22,800
itself uh that's why uh we were looking

1788
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:26,119
for a way to dilute enough so by

1789
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,679
diluting you reduce the temperature at

1790
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:32,679
which this happens and therefore you

1791
01:38:28,679 --> 01:38:36,040
have to go below the uh

1792
01:38:32,679 --> 01:38:38,880
self self combustion temperature and

1793
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:42,639
here is this so for

1794
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:47,800
example we could find that uh I think we

1795
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:50,400
did like 1500 or maybe thousand this is

1796
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:53,920
the amount of water molecules that you

1797
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,920
have to put in

1798
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:01,280
I don't think anybody has ever done this

1799
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:04,800
kind of a uh thing uh

1800
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:09,199
practically but conceptually it's uh

1801
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:12,840
it's something to be kept in mind so I

1802
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:16,599
think yes we can stop here today and uh

1803
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:20,599
next time we do uh chemical

1804
01:39:16,599 --> 01:39:20,599
equilibrium okay
