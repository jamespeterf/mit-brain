00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,800
I'm a London -based neuropsychologist and 
former professional ballerina. I came across 

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,360
MIT Open Learning back in 2022 whilst 
looking for new things to learn about the 

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,800
world and myself. My highlights remain 
Professor Adams' course in quantum mechanics 

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,040
and late Professor Winston's lectures 
on AI. I am now enrolled in the Computer 

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,400
Science and Programming in Python course 
offered by MIT, quite an adventure. I am a 

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,080
multilingual and I find learning how to 
code similar to learning a new language, a 

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,000
fascinating challenge, along with perhaps 
finally learning how to cycle this year. And 

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,920
yes, I do have my debugging rubber ducky. 
Thank you MIT Open Learning for making 

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,160
knowledge accessible and for encouraging 
curious minds to share and apply knowledge, 

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,840
hopefully for the greater good. It is 
perhaps the only way for us humans to move 

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,040
forward. And that comes from me, the 
greatest Terminator fan. Thank you.
