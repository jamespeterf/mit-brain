1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
I've been able to see how the technical

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,480
work that I'm doing is going to directly

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,640
impact policy being made today and in

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,640
the future.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,039
As we introduce more time dependent

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,039
renewables, so that's solar, hydro, wind

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,119
into our grid generation, it becomes

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,000
increasingly important for planners to

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,240
have as much temporal granular data as

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,160
they can to build the optimal grid.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,679
Essentially, better energy grid design

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,680
methods will make generating grid

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,160
designs with high resolution data more

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,239
scalable. As planners and governments

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,399
get access to this new technology and

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,040
these new methods, it becomes easier for

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,360
them to be more agile in how they're

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
generating grid designs. This means that

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,719
in historically underserved communities

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,640
with developing grids, they are able to

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
test and retest their models more

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
frequently. And I think this kind of

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
government engineering intersection is

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,600
just something that's going to be

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
increasingly important in coming years.

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
In cases where you're experiencing these

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,360
extreme weather events, it becomes

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,000
increasingly important to include as

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,560
much temporal data as you can such that

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
your energy grid design is going to be

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
able to fare well when inevitably

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,159
extreme weather events happen again in

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,240
the future. When vulnerable communities

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,799
get hit by these kind of extreme weather

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
events that where their energy grids are

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,200
being maxed out, they suffer the most

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
because climate change is as much an

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,040
engineering issue as it is a social

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,040
justice issue.
