1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,799
okay everybody can hear me okay great

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,480
okay well fantastic I want to thank ILP

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,799
for inviting us to be part of this uh

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,359
important conference and I thought what

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,720
we do to kind of warm us up is to First

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,760
say a couple words about what we do at

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,119
the MIT Mobility initiative and then to

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,160
go into something that we call our 10

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,240
Trends so I will explain this uh shortly

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,840
uh but we've got a hold track uh signed

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,079
up for you today so I am going to be

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,360
immediately followed by Jin waza who's a

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,559
professor of city and Transportation

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,920
Planning and ginoa was actually the

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,640
founder of the MIT Mobility initiative

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,520
so it's wonderful that he'll be with us

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,960
shortly talking a little bit about some

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,280
of the Dynamics that we see in um the

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
electric the trend toward

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,000
electrification and in particular

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,399
distinctions between uh the US and and

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,640
China then we'll have a short break we

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,720
have uh Professor Elsa olti coming to

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,520
talk to us about uh the critical

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,560
materials the supply of lithium and

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,520
graphite and Cobalt and all the things

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,520
that we need to go into an electric

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,720
vehicle battery um and then finally we

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,159
have H Professor Alex jaot who is at the

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,200
Sloan school who will join us and talk

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,560
about some work that we've been doing at

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,479
the MMI on optimization of electric

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,520
vehicles

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,799
uh charging infrastructure so that's our

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,479
program for the afternoon um let me just

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,960
say a couple words about what we do at

37
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:47,680
the mobility initiative our focus is on

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,320
Transportation as a system and that word

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,479
system is is really critical what does

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,200
that really mean it typically means a

41
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:00,079
complicated mix of people and

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,600
institutions that come together to

43
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,840
deliver value and that's what Mobility

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,800
really is it's that's what it's all

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,640
about um and what we want out of that

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,680
system and I think many of us would

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,239
agree boils down to three very simple

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,800
words right what do we want out of our

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,879
transportation system we want it to be

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,160
safe we want it to be clean and we want

51
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,680
it to be inclusive safe and clean are

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,120
very

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,239
self-evident inclusion is a concept

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,800
that's received more attention recently

55
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,120
and it really boils down to um

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,920
affordability both in terms of time and

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,760
in terms of money um so how we achieve

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,959
this at the mmis through these four

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,560
pillars research education

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,760
entrepreneurship and engagement this is

61
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,800
a bit of what we're doing here today

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,400
meeting with folks Business Leaders um

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,680
and really sort of fostering um dialogue

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,319
and interaction around the work uh that

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,720
that that we're doing um and so just

66
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,440
briefly our approach is around

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,159
technology of course but I can't

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,920
underemphasize how important human

69
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,080
behavior is and uh ginoa who's just

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,200
walked in the back of the door someone

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,760
I've learned a lot from has mentioned

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,440
that if you think about how do we

73
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,319
influence human behavior in

74
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,560
transportation there's re how do we

75
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,159
change people's behavior and there's

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,680
really kind of three big levers to that

77
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,400
so one is about rules you know we might

78
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,000
set speed limits and so forth one is

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,760
about Norms Norms is you know why is it

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,599
that people don't cross the street

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,519
illegally in Tokyo but they do in New

82
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,879
York City that's a kind of cultural norm

83
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,480
right and then there's pricing so these

84
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,400
are really important uh metrics to look

85
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,599
at when we talk about Transportation

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,680
Systems of course there's the whole

87
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,840
policy and Regulatory domain uh we look

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,400
a lot at business model uh Innovation

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,920
and in particular and I think this is

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,239
something unique to the MIT Mobility

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,159
initiative we really try to sort of

92
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,879
Foster Real World deployments um in the

93
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,760
city of Detroit in uh the city of uh

94
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,639
Phoenix Arizona we're doing work sort of

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,639
on the ground and applying our our

96
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,360
research um you know why here at MIT

97
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,919
these are some of the strengths of MIT

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,360
as an institution they align very well

99
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,280
with transportation systems and there's

100
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,560
a number of labs AC Across The Institute

101
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,639
and a number of people across the

102
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,600
Institute that are involved in looking

103
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:42,320
at some dimension of the mobility system

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,720
it could be what Elsa is doing with the

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
supply chain for for Batteries it could

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,600
be around electrification it could be

107
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,720
around autonomous and so forth um so we

108
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
look at these systems challenges and we

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,800
ask these sort of big picture questions

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
like how much energy is required for the

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,080
future of autonomous Mobility for the

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,800
compute not moving the vehicles but just

113
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,960
for the compute itself and the short

114
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,320
answer there is that it's probably a

115
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,120
very significant amount of energy uh we

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,240
look at Connected vehicles um you know

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
looking uh I mentioned this in Phoenix

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,720
Arizona this project on intersections

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
where we're balancing very

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,680
highresolution and expensive liar

121
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,160
sensors with very low resolution sensors

122
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,960
and and trying to find the optical mix

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,759
to increase safety at uh four-way

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,199
intersections um on electrification

125
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,039
we've looked at policy uh issues around

126
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,960
the gas tax um a number of other

127
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,639
questions and then uh on public

128
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,080
transportation as well hugely important

129
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,479
area for the for the mobility system

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,680
okay so um you know we are we have

131
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,600
companies that are members of the MIT

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,960
Mobility initiativ these are some of the

133
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,560
companies uh that we that we work work

134
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,400
with um and with that short introduction

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:11,520
let me get into the uh the 10

136
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,639
Trends okay so this is really first of

137
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,680
all what I'm about to say are really

138
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,080
actually not Trends they're more like

139
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,759
issues or tensions that we observe

140
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,319
within our Global transportation system

141
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,039
and I should say that uh we're looking

142
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,759
at surface we're not taking this to

143
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,280
Maritime we're not taking this to

144
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,960
Aviation and you'll see it's it is a bit

145
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,240
of a US Centric view so it's always

146
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,319
interesting when we travel outside of

147
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,599
the United States to get a very

148
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,599
different

149
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:47,560
perspective let's start with the first

150
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,560
of the 10 Trends uh and this is what we

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,599
call the

152
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:58,360
criticality of um China's role in the

153
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,319
electric vehicle uh battery uh Market um

154
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,840
now you know that

155
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,639
the battery of an electric vehicle

156
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,599
composes about 30 to 40% of the cost

157
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,280
basis of the vehicle so it is truly a

158
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:17,520
critical and strategic component and

159
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,840
what we have seen is um after uh many uh

160
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,680
Decades of um various consumer

161
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,520
incentives and V various production

162
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,039
incentives and subsidies uh China has

163
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,599
built up a remarkable uh Capac capacity

164
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:37,599
and capability in the EV battery space

165
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:39,800
um and you know uh we've just we and

166
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,560
it's it's really challenging for us in

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,319
the west I mean those of you from Europe

168
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,000
are probably familiar with the northfold

169
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,639
story where you know we're looking at

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,840
after 11 billion EUR of investment into

171
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,080
building a sort of European battery

172
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,560
Powerhouse there are some very serious

173
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,960
challenges uh within that within that

174
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,919
Institution

175
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,159
so if we look at the sort of global

176
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:10,000
market share right these are uh data

177
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:15,080
from the first half of 24 two companies

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,520
catl and byd account for well over half

179
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,080
of the global market and what's really

180
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,080
surprising is if we compare the share of

181
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,479
those two companies in 21 the share has

182
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,800
increased remarkably byd from about 7%

183
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,479
to about

184
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,000
16% so things are moving very quickly uh

185
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,919
in this space the other companies in red

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
are also Chinese origin uh battery

187
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,479
manufacturers um and if you look at it

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,120
from sort of breaking down the

189
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,480
components of a battery um at a very

190
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,279
large level the cathode the anode the

191
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,240
electrolytes Etc you can see that

192
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,560
there's a great degree of sort of

193
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,279
influence from Chinese industry uh in

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,160
this um in in the uh the functionality

195
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:04,320
of the battery but this is something

196
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,240
that really caught my attention so last

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,640
year when we did the 10 Trends we were

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,519
talking about the shifting geopolitical

199
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,000
world and we're talking about what the

200
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:17,399
heck is going on in China right so China

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,920
is they became the largest Automotive

202
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,839
Market in 2009 they have the capacity to

203
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,480
build nearly 40 million vehicles per

204
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,440
year but the Home Market is more like 30

205
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,839
so what do you do with that difference

206
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,079
the 10 million difference you push out

207
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,640
to export that's what we talked about

208
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,839
last year and we're what's concerning is

209
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,680
we're seeing this kind of overc capacity

210
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,720
Trend this is some data from Bloomberg

211
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,519
uh new energy Finance where they're

212
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,040
looking at a very high degree of

213
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,640
production overc capacity in the

214
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,920
electric vehicle battery Market over the

215
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,560
next uh year or two um So that obviously

216
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,399
has very real uh

217
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,720
implications so that's the first Trend

218
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,680
the uh second trend is about this kind

219
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,079
of

220
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,680
intensification in um the sort of in the

221
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,079
global uh trade situation with um

222
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,560
increasing tariffs with a kind of

223
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,279
movement toward two different a

224
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,240
bifurcation you know I spent a good part

225
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,079
of my career at the world economic Forum

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,600
where it was always about sort of

227
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,839
integration and globalization and so

228
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,720
forth and now we're living in a very

229
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,360
different world uh where we see these

230
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,720
kind of uh different camps forming with

231
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,639
big implications across Mobility from

232
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,320
building ships to building commercial

233
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,000
aircraft uh to the automotive Market

234
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,720
which of course you know we'll we'll

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
talk uh more

236
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,680
about um and I will say this I've never

237
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,279
seen the term National Security brought

238
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,880
up more in transportation related

239
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,760
conversations than I have like over the

240
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,120
past uh year or

241
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,760
two okay just a little footnote on trade

242
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,320
you know you may I'm sure many of you

243
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,279
saw this but you know sort of an

244
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,880
important development much earlier this

245
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,200
year was when Mexico became the number

246
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,480
one importer to the United States

247
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040
surpassing China and this is very

248
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,480
important for those of you familiar with

249
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,720
the structure of the automotive industry

250
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,680
I understand that you know there are

251
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,040
there's a lot of Automotive trade uh in

252
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,680
components and fully built Vehicles

253
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,560
between Mexico and the United States

254
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,880
there are Chinese uh oems that have

255
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,200
entered and built production facilities

256
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,920
in Mexico and so forth so many uh

257
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,680
implications

258
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,639
there okay a third Trend uh one of our

259
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,279
uh senior fellows at the MIT Mobility

260
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,040
initiative is a gentleman named David

261
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,639
zipper and he has been writing a lot

262
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,480
about this topic and has sort of coined

263
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,720
this term that I really like it's called

264
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,200
car bloat and this is very much a it's

265
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,440
not just a US phenomenon I mean we see

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,199
the this this growth in the size and

267
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,800
weight of the vehicles on our roads uh

268
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:20,639
in Europe as well and um you know if you

269
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,720
look up there you'll see the sort of

270
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,920
bestselling vehicle here in the United

271
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,800
States and how it's kind of changed over

272
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,279
the over the decades and the chart shows

273
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,199
you the you know the weight of your

274
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,600
typical vehicle which of course

275
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:38,760
plummeted during the 1970s oil crisis

276
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,000
but then has regained and then surpassed

277
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,800
where we were um and the implication

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,320
here is about um

279
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,959
fatalities um safety right I mean larger

280
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,800
heavier Vehicles clearly are more

281
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,240
dangerous the data in the United States

282
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,519
are very much moving in the wrong

283
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,800
direction we've been having more and

284
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,560
more Road

285
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,880
fatalities uh in this in this country um

286
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,720
and you can see particularly the data is

287
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,199
alarming for pedestrian or so-called

288
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,240
vulnerable Road users cyclists and and

289
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,360
pedestrians um and you can see a

290
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,360
researcher at University of Hawaii sort

291
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,079
of tried to quantify the fact that you

292
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,920
know as the ve the front end of the

293
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,360
vehicle gets larger and blocks

294
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,240
visibility what impact does that have on

295
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,639
on safety and I I think actually this

296
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,240
chart is a a nice very simple kind of

297
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,040
summary of the situation that we're

298
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,800
seeing here in the United States where

299
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,720
we've moved from you know more and more

300
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,639
people when there are Road fatalities

301
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,040
are pedestrians they are cyclists and

302
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,959
you know very tragically we had one of

303
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,040
our own a graduate student here at MIT

304
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,519
who was who was killed several months

305
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,399
ago not I mean minutes from where we're

306
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,880
where we are right now um just you know

307
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,639
uh on the street as a as a

308
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:10,600
cyclist uh by a very large truck that

309
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:14,160
couldn't see her so this is a a deeply

310
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,320
uh concerning um challenge that that

311
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,920
that we

312
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,480
face okay Trend number four is um you

313
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,480
know we've seen the movement toward

314
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,519
electrification and and it's really

315
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,519
exciting and but you know we and those

316
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,199
of you with an energy background in the

317
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,320
room will be very familiar with this

318
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:38,120
situation which is to

319
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,120
say we've seen demand increasing for

320
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,920
electricity from people putting heat

321
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,440
pumps in their homes and people putting

322
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,800
electric vehicles in their garages but

323
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,000
of course as you all know every time you

324
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,720
type something into chat GPT it uses 10

325
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,279
times the amount of electricity as when

326
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,560
you use to type something into Google

327
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,560
and so that has a big sort of impact on

328
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,440
you know where where is demand going and

329
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,399
what's that going to do to uh

330
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,360
residential um electricity prices uh

331
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,839
here in the United States so this is

332
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,399
some data that looks at that price in

333
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:19,399
terms of uh dollars per kilowatt hour um

334
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,680
or cents per kilowatt hour and looking

335
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,040
at sort of how that has very much been

336
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,480
uh trending up so as an operator as an

337
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,720
owner as a user of an electric vehicle

338
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,519
this changes your sort of operating uh

339
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,519
Dynamics it changes your Calculus right

340
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,199
um makes it less favorable if you will

341
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,360
on a cost basis to drive an

342
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:46,759
EV and this is a study from Goldman

343
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,560
Sachs that just looked at um you know

344
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:53,399
the this demand from data centers and

345
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,959
from Ai and it's not so much to like

346
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,639
look at the numbers here but it's to

347
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:01,079
look at the shape and the shape is very

348
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,880
much what what we call here a hockey

349
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,040
stick right where there are many smart

350
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,920
people who have Insight in this area who

351
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,800
are thinking that this is the shape of

352
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,560
that curve moving forward we don't know

353
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,720
we look at Mobility systems but we know

354
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,079
that this will have a big impact on our

355
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,600
transportation ecosystem if this does

356
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,199
indeed

357
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,120
evolve um and you know the iea has done

358
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,360
this study um where they looked at the

359
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,959
amount of energy that's just sort of

360
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,959
waiting in line to be connected to the

361
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,759
grid and the Aging Grid in some parts of

362
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,040
Europe even older than here in the

363
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,279
United States as a kind of bottleneck in

364
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,160
the electricity grid to you know to

365
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,639
deliver those electrons that we would

366
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,680
need to power our future

367
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,759
Mobility um one of our researchers uh

368
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,959
Professor Carman noted that you know

369
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,519
currently Computing accounts for about

370
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,839
1% of global electric consumption that

371
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,799
figure by the way is about 2% here in

372
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:10,760
the United States and but we expect that

373
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:13,240
to increase to say 10% in in 10 years um

374
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,799
and this was in reference to that work

375
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,959
that I alluded to earlier looking at if

376
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,280
all of the if if a significant share of

377
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,039
the vehicles on our streets converted to

378
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,480
some form of autonomous Mobility that's

379
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,919
going to require a lot of computing

380
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,480
right which is going to require

381
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:38,360
electricity to power that Computing as

382
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:41,160
well okay um the the fifth trend is uh

383
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,880
around you know last year we were

384
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,440
looking at sort of this depressing

385
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,919
moment around autonomous Mobility many

386
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,400
of you will recall that um Crews uh in

387
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,039
San Francisco had had this terrible

388
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,880
accident um you know Business Week had

389
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,960
headlines like we've spent a hundred

390
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,559
billion dollar on this technology and

391
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,159
it's gone nowhere right so now what

392
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:11,039
we've seen is a little bit more raise of

393
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:13,880
Hope if you will as people consider

394
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,480
applying foundation models uh large

395
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,559
language models sort of the AV what you

396
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:23,120
could call AV 2.0 technology and and

397
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,039
certainly investors have also taken note

398
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,159
of this and we've seen some big

399
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,320
Investments uh in in the space um you

400
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,440
know a billion dollar flowing into one

401
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,919
company in the UK uh with soft bank

402
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,200
money but I wanted to kind of highlight

403
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,039
this story here because we don't hear as

404
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,200
much about this in the United States

405
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,960
that over the summer there's a kind of

406
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,400
protest in Wuhan where many of the uh

407
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:53,039
taxi drivers were saying look um how are

408
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:57,919
we supposed to compete with these uh

409
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:01,520
Robo taxis so um you know BYU runs a a a

410
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,159
service called a go they have um almost

411
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,880
I think now almost a thousand Robo taxis

412
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,919
operating on the streets of Wuhan and

413
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
this is sort of the data point that

414
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,159
caught our attention a 10 kilometer ride

415
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,520
costs 4 to 16 R&B which is somewhere in

416
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,799
the range of 60 to

417
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,799
$240 just if you think about that for a

418
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:27,120
moment that's a six kilome or six mile

419
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,960
ride think about what you pay for your

420
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,159
Uber or your lift convert that is it in

421
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,679
the range of 60 cents to

422
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:39,440
$240 probably not and then compare that

423
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,080
to what the um a human driven ride Hil

424
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,200
service is offering in Wuhan and it's

425
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,760
you know times two times four uh so this

426
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,520
starts to point toward you know could

427
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,360
there be this um Breakaway where the

428
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,480
economics of autonomous systems really

429
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,880
do start to achieve the the vision that

430
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,480
drove so much of the hype 10 years years

431
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,559
ago uh Trend number six is around what I

432
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,400
what we would call growing pains with

433
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:11,240
softwar defined Vehicles what does this

434
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,159
mean what is this what I mean there is

435
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,520
so much ambiguity around this term

436
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,960
softwar defined Vehicles we like to

437
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,240
think of it having two sides there's a

438
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,440
consumer side to this which is to say

439
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,880
how do you bring the

440
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,720
personalization that you want off of

441
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,840
this device that you carry with you how

442
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,840
do you bring that into your automobile

443
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,880
how do you customize it to your tastes

444
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,120
and your preferences that's this one

445
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,960
side of the sdv coin the other side is

446
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,760
totally different it's an industry or

447
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,679
production side and to it's how do we

448
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,120
what is the fundamental architecture

449
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:53,120
that we use to build Vehicles where in

450
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,280
the past Automotive oems have worked

451
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,520
with suppliers that supplied uh

452
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,240
processors for Subs systems of the

453
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,240
automobile and did that very very well

454
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,880
and now is there a movement towards a

455
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,880
sort of unified processing architecture

456
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,760
within the vehicle and what are the

457
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,440
potential benefits and efficiencies to

458
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,760
be gained from that but it's been a hard

459
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,640
slog right it's been a hard slog because

460
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,720
you know car companies have certain core

461
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,520
talents and those are quite different

462
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,039
than the core talents that software

463
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,039
companies have and this has been this

464
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,880
fun mental tension in the automotive

465
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,360
industry for the past 10

466
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,480
years okay Trend number seven was one

467
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,880
that I kind of took a leap of faith on

468
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,120
and I'm I was sitting there and I'm like

469
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,640
does this make sense is this really a

470
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,200
thing and so it's a funny concept that

471
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,760
I've been testing with people uh we just

472
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,679
had our vision day recently where it's

473
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,400
it's our big event and you know we

474
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,640
brought together um well over a hundred

475
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,720
real leaders in the space and it's and

476
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,440
it resonated so what the way that I

477
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,799
would Define this is to say you know

478
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,360
we've always had sort of you know our

479
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,440
values shape our politics our politics

480
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,080
shape our values of course that shapes

481
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,559
the decisions that we make in daily life

482
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,000
for all of us but it feels like it's

483
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,840
become more sort of pronounced more

484
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,080
polar sometimes more

485
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,159
acrimonious and you know we've looked at

486
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,760
like what has happened in New York City

487
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,080
with congestion pricing where um you

488
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,080
know many of us in the MMI were so

489
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,039
hopeful about what that could mean for

490
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,919
the public transportation system in New

491
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,520
York City and the setback that we saw

492
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,720
when the governor of New York put

493
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,520
congestion pricing on hold many of you

494
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,600
know that now she's put it back on the

495
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,240
agenda at a lower rate this is a really

496
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,480
big story in

497
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,799
transportation and you know ginoa who's

498
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,000
worked in you know in London and helped

499
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,120
tfl to implement their congestion

500
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,279
pricing scheme has worked in Singapore

501
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,600
there's much that can be learned about

502
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,480
what this can mean for the world uh

503
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:14,520
going forward but it's driven

504
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,320
by us it's driven by our values and our

505
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,960
perceptions and when ideology enters

506
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,080
into this

507
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,640
debate we make I think I would submit

508
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,240
worse decisions so that's uh Trend

509
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,080
number seven Trend number eight is for

510
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,960
all of the urban planning um enthusiasts

511
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,480
in the in the crowd uh this is something

512
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,520
that uh those of you from Europe will be

513
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,320
very familiar that actually in many

514
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,760
cities in Europe they have uh so-called

515
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,200
parking maximums that say you cannot

516
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,320
have more than a certain amount of

517
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,320
parking per unit of housing that's

518
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,520
provided here in the United States we

519
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,120
have just the opposite we have this mish

520
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,840
mash of M Municipal requirements that

521
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,000
say if you build build a condominium or

522
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,080
an apartment unit or a single family

523
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,360
home or what have you you have to

524
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,320
provide x amount of parking um and

525
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,080
finally that's being sort of seriously

526
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,200
looked at and questioned about the cost

527
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:21,960
implications of that uh here in in the

528
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,840
US um Trend number nine is about uh it's

529
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,559
really two trends that are here okay one

530
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,360
of them is about sort of this post

531
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:33,360
industrial manufacturing uh this

532
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,960
struggle that we have

533
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,640
where

534
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:45,080
in many advanced economies the capacity

535
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,159
to make things seems to slowly be

536
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,919
deteriorating right even even here at

537
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:51,559
MIT right there's a lot of you know the

538
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,039
young students come in and they want to

539
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:57,840
go into you know Ai and software maybe

540
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,720
less interest in Industrial Systems

541
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,679
mechanical engineering things like that

542
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,159
and so you have to ask what are the

543
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:08,000
implications you know for for the future

544
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,760
and then you have to flip that with the

545
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,200
other side of this coin which is

546
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Illustrated in this picture in um you

547
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,080
know this could be in New York or San

548
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,480
Francisco we I I mentioned that we work

549
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,880
with public transportation agencies here

550
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,960
in the United States we work with the

551
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,399
seven

552
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,919
largest Fair

553
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:32,360
evasion people doing this is a epic

554
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,520
issue in public transportation systems

555
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,559
and people didn't used to do this as

556
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,600
much it's shocking how much it's

557
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,200
happening in in San Francisco and other

558
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,880
cities and that is a sort of Norm you

559
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,120
know getting back to those behavioral

560
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,679
Norms that is a Norm that's being

561
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,840
established you people might say well

562
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,919
that guy didn't pay why you know on the

563
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,919
bus that guy didn't pay why I'm not

564
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,559
going to be a sucker I'm not going to

565
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,919
pay no one else is paying and this sort

566
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,600
of vicious cycle starts to establish

567
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:07,600
itself so there's a lot to unpack here

568
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:12,679
but I think two sort of important sides

569
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:16,240
of a similar uh of a so societal Trend

570
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:19,039
that's impacting the world of

571
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,919
Mobility okay and then finally we always

572
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,600
uh look at the financial uh ecosystem

573
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,640
because it's really really important in

574
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,559
transportation systems um and

575
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,520
here

576
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,320
there's the if you look at money that's

577
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,520
coming from Venture Capital into

578
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,120
Mobility so the chart here shows the

579
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,840
flow from venture capital and private

580
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,320
Equity combined and you know I've noted

581
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,039
this before isn't it strange that in you

582
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,480
know covid we're all stuck at home

583
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,760
oceans of money floods into Mobility

584
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,679
right I mean that's kind of odd but

585
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,919
that's what happened and since then

586
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,520
we've seen that volume declined

587
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,279
significantly and now start to

588
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,080
recover but we have to ask where does

589
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:11,480
the money to drive electrification

590
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,480
where's that really going to come from

591
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,039
it's not coming from Venture Capital

592
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,919
it's coming from large corporations that

593
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,360
are making big Investments it's coming

594
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,120
from governments that are also making

595
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,279
big

596
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:29,240
Investments um so there there's this

597
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:32,360
this understanding of like how the

598
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,799
financial ecosystem impacts uh the

599
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,919
transportation ecosystem and they tend

600
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,000
to sometimes seem to be out of sync uh

601
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,559
is an important Trend uh that that we

602
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,080
have been

603
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:47,120
monitoring okay so with that let's talk

604
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,960
a little bit um and I want to hear from

605
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,919
all of you um so it do any of these kind

606
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,000
of resonate is there anything that you

607
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,399
just completely disagree with and said

608
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,200
no no that's that's not it or is there

609
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:03,080
something like huge that we missed in

610
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,159
the in the space of surface mobility and

611
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,600
I'm just going to check we have about 10

612
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:12,960
minutes to to uh to have a conversation

613
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,960
so questions comments

614
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,600
Reflections

615
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:25,000
Carol hello thank you very much it was

616
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:29,480
very very clear uh just a question about

617
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,919
uh customers and clients uh um could it

618
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,279
be um an important input to see what the

619
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,640
customer is ready is ready to go to to

620
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,880
switch or not to electrical

621
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:44,000
Vehicles yeah yeah absolutely consumer

622
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,360
sentiment around around electric

623
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
vehicles and I think uh jenoa is going

624
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,519
to cover this a little bit in in his

625
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,880
talk as well but let me just briefly say

626
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,320
this I mean first of all it's surprising

627
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,519
that I think electric vehicles got

628
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,720
caught up in a little bit of that Trend

629
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,320
about the

630
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,960
politicalization of mobility and it

631
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,240
became almost a sign of you know who you

632
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,120
vote for what your political party is

633
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,360
and I mean even here in this country

634
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,240
even cooktops became a political issue

635
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,760
do you cook with electricity or with

636
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,640
natural gas and so I think there is that

637
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,559
Dimension uh that that has uh entered

638
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,159
the equation but I think consumers are

639
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,240
learning more about electric vehicles a

640
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,200
major factor on the consumer side is the

641
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,000
charging system and so we started

642
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,080
looking at the reliability of the

643
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,559
charging

644
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,440
infrastructure two and a half years ago

645
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,840
and realized very quickly it's not good

646
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,399
the reliability of the public electric

647
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,039
vehicle charging infrastructure in the

648
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:53,200
United States is not good and we thought

649
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,760
that with the investment that the

650
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,880
current Administration has made you know

651
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,600
$7.5 billion in electric vehicle

652
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,799
charging that we would see some

653
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,240
significant improvements in that

654
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,080
reliability and it seems to me like we

655
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:14,039
definitely saw a big Improvement in the

656
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:16,919
availability of public EV charging the

657
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:18,760
um you know the Gabe Klein who runs the

658
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,320
joint office will tell you that they've

659
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,640
doubled the number of EV Chargers in the

660
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,200
US which is great that's a great

661
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,720
accomplishment but Camille Terry who

662
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,279
runs charger help which is a startup

663
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,840
company out of Los Angeles where their

664
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,840
whole business was let's go and fix

665
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,200
broken electric vehicle Chargers and

666
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,159
understand why they're

667
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,080
broken they just did a reliability study

668
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,440
over the summer that she shared with us

669
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,640
at our at our vision day and the numbers

670
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,559
were are really concerning I mean we're

671
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,440
still at under 80% reliability true

672
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,399
reliability of EV Chargers in this

673
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,159
country I mean you still have more than

674
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,240
a one in five chance that you're not

675
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,799
going to get the electrons any electrons

676
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,840
or the electrons that you thought you

677
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,000
would get the rate of charging that you

678
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,080
thought you would get and so that starts

679
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,240
to have a backlash effect on how you

680
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,240
know consumers feel um about

681
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,799
electrification uh so I have a question

682
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,000
so today we you don't much mention about

683
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,120
EV oil like fra but so how do you think

684
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,159
about such kind of fi

685
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,480
yeah um you know if we go back to I

686
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,760
mentioned in

687
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,760
2021 which was we had two things happen

688
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,080
we had tremendous amounts of capital

689
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,279
Venture Capital particularly invested in

690
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,799
the mobility space and we had the spack

691
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,919
wave happen as well which is another

692
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:54,440
story but the if you look at where those

693
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:57,600
dollars were invested Three core spaces

694
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,279
dominated about 80% of it so Electric

695
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,399
vehic iic Les and batteries autonomous

696
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,279
mobility and the third one being the

697
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,000
question that you asked about electric

698
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,320
vertical takeoff and Landing

699
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
vehicles um we don't we don't do a lot

700
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,320
of work in this space we're running a

701
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,399
project in Detroit that looks at sort of

702
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,679
the equity implications of drone

703
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,480
delivery systems but when you talk about

704
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,559
people moving being picked up in the air

705
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,159
and moved

706
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,960
around what we have seen is a shift in

707
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,600
thinking from Urban aerial Mobility

708
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,080
which is I'm going to zip around Mexico

709
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,559
City I'm going to zip around Los Angeles

710
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,679
or Tokyo in this vehicle that comes this

711
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,080
Air Taxi that comes and picks me up and

712
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,559
moves me to another location we've seen

713
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,240
a shift in thinking from that model to

714
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:50,480
more what we could call Regional aerial

715
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,200
Mobility which is to say I'm going to

716
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,279
get from here to Providence Rhode Island

717
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,919
in a in a EV tall some maybe not even as

718
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,799
far as New York New York City but some

719
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,720
place where there's there is a real

720
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:07,480
market and and this vehicle actually

721
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,600
makes sense to deploy in that kind of

722
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,679
point pointto point mark rate and we've

723
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,399
seen experiments with um you know for uh

724
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,760
for airport connection as well and of

725
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,200
course there you have a a market that's

726
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,639
more willing to pay uh you know a

727
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:28,360
premium to to get to the airport quickly

728
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:31,080
um so I I can't give you deep ins into

729
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,720
this into this area I don't know if jino

730
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,760
just jump in if you have things to to

731
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,559
contribute okay all right um next

732
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,559
question please thank

733
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:47,880
you nitpicking uh number

734
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:52,120
three uh you show that

735
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,880
chart that U had the increase in

736
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,880
pedestrian

737
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,480
Debs that's in

738
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,679
percentages what are the actual numbers

739
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,679
of deaths and and the issue is do you

740
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:14,159
take into account the increased bicycle

741
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,919
and other kind of Transportation modes

742
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
that make

743
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,040
pedestrians you know collide with

744
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,720
vehicles uh because I mean look at the

745
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,000
Boston area we used to have a couple of

746
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,760
bicycles on the road we now have lots of

747
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,919
bicycles on the road the road so that

748
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,760
increases the potential conflict between

749
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,760
the two uh the the cars have gotten

750
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,159
bigger and heavier but they're also

751
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,919
gotten safer in terms of technology that

752
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:49,079
allows you to avoid things the cars have

753
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:52,079
gotten safer for the occupants of the

754
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:55,440
vehicle so what they haven't gotten is

755
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,040
safer for those outside of the vehicle

756
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,000
and in in fact The Economist ran a very

757
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,400
clever study simple simple study this

758
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,920
past summer that some of you might have

759
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,119
seen they ran a a cover article called

760
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:13,280
America's killer cars and what they

761
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:16,079
looked at is the the the chance of a

762
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,359
fatality inside the vehicle as a

763
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,000
passenger or driver clearly decreases as

764
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:24,920
the vehicle weight increases that's

765
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,160
intuitive right I mean if I'm driving a

766
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,320
big hulking heavy pickup truck and I

767
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,640
collide with a typical vehicle I'm less

768
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,359
likely to be hurt but then they looked

769
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,480
at the occupants of the other vehicle

770
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,680
and and you know when you see when a

771
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,960
large pickup truck hits a Honda Civic

772
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:49,320
it's a very bad equation for the

773
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,320
occupant of the of the Honda Civic

774
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,319
right it's still it's still bad exactly

775
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,640
exactly and I think you rais a good

776
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:02,359
point that we've seen we've seen a rise

777
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,359
in uh bike Lanes in the United States we

778
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:07,400
absolutely have and we've I guess maybe

779
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,400
in some cities You could argue we've

780
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,440
seen a rise of pedestrianization we'd

781
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,599
have to ask Andreas this question

782
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,119
but our sense is that that does not

783
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,040
that's not the the main causal driver

784
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,760
here right of what what's driving

785
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,839
remember this is a percentage you're

786
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,480
correct but the overall is an increase

787
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:33,560
toward 40 3,000 fatalities you know and

788
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:38,520
that number was was in the low

789
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:41,640
30,000 just 10 years ago so our the faat

790
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,920
the road fatality rate in the US has

791
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,440
overall has been increasing

792
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,880
significantly for the past 10 or 15

793
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,880
years and then on top of that then you

794
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,079
have this proportionality issue as well

795
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,280
and I'll just say one more thing if you

796
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,280
look at the number of fatality I have

797
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,880
this chart maybe I can pull it up if you

798
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,319
look at the number of Road fatalities in

799
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,960
the United States per 100,000 people

800
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:12,200
it's a very crude metric and you compare

801
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,200
that to the countries in Europe and you

802
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,720
compare that to Canada the United States

803
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,040
is not in an enviable position at all in

804
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,800
fact we are number one in the way that

805
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,480
you don't want to be number one we're

806
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,319
number one by significant margin and

807
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,480
that rate is five times worse than in

808
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:32,359
Scandinavian countries which happen to

809
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,680
be the lower end of the European

810
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,200
countries it's also worse in in than

811
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,400
Canada now you can say look in the

812
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:44,599
United States we drive further than they

813
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,760
do in Luxembourg that is true the

814
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,560
typical American drives more and

815
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,839
therefore there's more likely to be a

816
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,280
fatality and that VMT difference vehicle

817
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,000
miles traveled difference that accounts

818
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,400
for some of the difference in the

819
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,880
fatality rate but it does not account

820
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,240
for all of it in fact it it doesn't

821
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,240
really account for half of it so there's

822
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,440
something going on in this country and I

823
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,119
think that this thing about car bloat is

824
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:18,240
a is a reasonable Contender for you know

825
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,240
what's what's driving those uh

826
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:26,480
fatalities um and I think okay let's do

827
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,480
one more question excuse me sorry

828
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,119
um I had a question about the uh

829
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:39,079
autonomous mobility

830
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:41,800
and just the idea that the cost could

831
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:44,280
shift uh Mobility towards you know

832
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,800
autonomous are you looking at it sort of

833
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,480
like the same Trend with the gig economy

834
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,240
um Uber versus taxis Airbnb versus

835
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,960
hotels um what kind of lessons can we

836
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,960
learn from

837
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,520
that okay well there's a a lot to unpack

838
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,119
here it's a great question so the first

839
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,640
thing we have to recognize is when Uber

840
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:10,760
and Lyft were introduced they were sold

841
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,440
as environmentally friendly Solutions

842
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,160
because the idea was going to be that

843
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,040
people would drive less and that they

844
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,359
would share rides and you remember the

845
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,440
early days of lift when there was a pink

846
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:25,040
fuzzy mustache on the front of the

847
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,480
vehicle and the idea was not that you

848
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,520
sat in the back seat the idea was that

849
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,240
sat in the front seat and shared a ride

850
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,520
with somebody who happened to be driving

851
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,359
from Kendall Square where we are now

852
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,359
over to coolage corner on the other side

853
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,800
of the

854
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:45,599
river that's not the reality of what it

855
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,400
became it became four higher Services

856
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,359
right where the people would sit in the

857
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,839
back and then when you look at the

858
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,400
amount of time that Uber and lifts spend

859
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,359
um driving around empty this uh kind of

860
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,359
so-called Dead Heading where they're

861
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:04,240
basically going either waiting for a new

862
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,119
assignment or driving to go and pick up

863
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,839
a

864
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,960
passenger the environmental implications

865
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,040
of that are are not are not good at at

866
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,720
all so that may not have been the exact

867
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,079
question that you're asking but that's

868
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,000
kind of with there's a long sort of you

869
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,160
know history now to this is not to knock

870
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,319
on Uber oryt in in any way I think

871
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,160
they're you know great services and it's

872
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,160
transform the way that we move around

873
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,359
and it's wonderful to have choices out

874
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,160
there and to be able to make these you

875
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,359
to have a a greater portfolio of options

876
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,920
in Mobility but let's not fool ourselves

877
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,280
that it is something that's like saving

878
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,920
the planet it's that movement towards

879
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,480
shared Mobility that will drive you know

880
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,200
the environmental sustainability of

881
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,400
transportation and of course there's

882
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:59,240
nothing more shared than you know a

883
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,240
public transportation system

884
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:17,520
yeah is just decrease in cost enough to

885
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,640
drive human behavior towards trusting

886
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,880
autonomous Mobility across the board in

887
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,760
the same way that you can willingly just

888
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,440
go live in a stranger's house rather

889
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,760
than a established Hotel

890
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,359
think it's a great point and actually

891
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,520
I'm really glad you brought up trust

892
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:34,640
because I mean if you think about it

893
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,960
let's go back again to ride hail to Uber

894
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,920
and lft if you told somebody 20 years

895
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,119
ago you're going to push a button on

896
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,599
your phone some guy's going to pull up

897
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,040
in his you know in his Honda and you're

898
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,040
going to jump in the back seat and you

899
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,760
don't know this person at all you might

900
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,680
have said well I'm not doing that I

901
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:54,520
don't trust that person but trust became

902
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,160
quickly established and I would think

903
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:00,480
that what we're seeing in in in Wuhan as

904
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,800
may be a test case and in San Francisco

905
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,480
and other places is trust and Phoenix

906
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,880
trust does start to get established

907
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,079
right people will start to trust the

908
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,920
system provided that you can there's

909
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:18,960
some perception that this that the

910
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:21,200
safety is is there and I I think that's

911
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,040
kind of what's the you know the big

912
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,559
question in autonomous Mobility has

913
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:30,040
always been how safe is safe enough

914
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,680
I would just say this this is so hard to

915
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,640
quantify but it does certainly seem when

916
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,079
you look at the like studies that are

917
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,880
coming out of wh and so forth it does

918
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:44,640
