1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,400
So last time we defined canonical forms

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,400
of a linear program

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
and

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,039
they're maximize

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:36,640
cranspose X where these are vectors.

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:39,920
with such that are sorry subject to

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:45,239
ax is less than or equal to b

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,239
and x is greater than equal to zero.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,879
And the duel for the canonical form

10
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,960
duel

11
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,960
we showed was minimum

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,720
B transpose Y. So we've taken the right

13
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,080
hand sides of the equation and turned

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,200
them into the objective function.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,320
A transpose Y

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,880
is greater than equal to C. So we've

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
taken the objective function of the

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,680
primal

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,360
and turned it into the right hand side

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,159
of the equations of the duel and y

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,159
greater than or equal to zero.

22
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,240
And last time

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,920
we showed weak duality

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,240
for any

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,240
feasible X

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,200
in the primal and any feasible Y in the

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,840
dual solution. Now feasible just means

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,840
they satisfy the constraints.

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Um

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,239
cranspose x is less than or equal to

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,239
branspose

32
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,239
y.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Um

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,000
so this is true

35
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,760
for

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,319
when the optimal value is

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,319
um finite.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,480
So a linear program

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,519
can have

40
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,519
finite optimum

41
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,720
It can be infeasible.

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,319
What's an infeasible program?

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:17,519
Um, x1 greater than equal to 5 and x1

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,200
less than equal to three. So this is a

45
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
basically trivial example of a

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,080
infeasible program. there are no

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,360
solutions and most infeasible programs

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,200
it's much harder to you know you cannot

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,680
tell that it's in feasible just by

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,680
looking at it and it can be unbounded

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
and let's give you an example of that

52
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,560
maximize x

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,319
x greater than 3

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,319
okay you can see that

55
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,200
you know you can find a visible x such

56
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:02,239
that has any value for the objective

57
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,680
function and um so these are actually

58
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,400
it's pretty clear that these are the

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,400
only three possibilities.

60
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,599
Okay.

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,720
Now I'm going to tell you

62
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,759
well something that follows immediately

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,759
from weak duality. If the primal is

64
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,759
unbounded,

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,240
the duel is in feasible.

66
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,639
And that's because if there were some

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,880
feasible solution to the duel, then you

68
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,800
could find a solution to the primal

69
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,639
which is larger than that.

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,160
And this is a contradiction of weak

71
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:13,800
duality. And similarly, if dual is

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,800
unbounded, the primal isn't feasible.

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,199
And there's one more possibility.

74
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,199
Possible

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,120
dual

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,639
primal

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,639
are

78
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,639
both

79
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,639
invisible.

80
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,840
So, this doesn't happen very often, but

81
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,880
it can happen and you probably should be

82
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,320
aware of it.

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
We're not going to discuss it any

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,520
further. Sometimes we give a homework

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,160
problem asking you to find an example

86
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,960
where these are where this is the case.

87
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,120
And it's not that hard a homework

88
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,520
problem. So if you want to figure out

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,919
how this can happen, you can go home and

90
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,639
you know figure it out or you can

91
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,360
probably look it up on the Wikipedia and

92
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,360
find it that way.

93
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
So

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,680
okay.

95
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,479
So what first thing I want to do today

96
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,400
is talk about

97
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,039
um

98
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,720
what the primal and dual look like for

99
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,720
things that are not in canonical form.

100
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,240
And

101
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,400
I'll first give you the

102
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,080
treatment in the lecture notes and then

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,960
I will give you my own treatment which

104
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,199
is slightly well it's not really

105
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,720
different but it's slightly different

106
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,240
and I think it makes it easier

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,199
but

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
so let's look at a proof of duality.

109
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,240
Um,

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,840
maybe I should

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,759
do this by example because I like doing

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,319
things by example because it's easier

113
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,120
than [snorts] sometimes it's easier than

114
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:19,680
doing them abstractly. So let's say max

115
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,639
3x1

116
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,639
+ 5 x2 - 2 x3.

117
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:35,080
Um, x1 + x2 less than or equal to 8.

118
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:44,240
X1 - X3 is greater than or equal to 1

119
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,319
and X2

120
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
plus

121
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
Okay, I did this wrong.

122
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,840
I want to leave a gap here so you can

123
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,319
line up the variables.

124
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,280
Greateral 1

125
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,599
and x2

126
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,000
+ x3

127
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,000
= 4.

128
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,280
Recall

129
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,599
proof

130
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,599
of duality.

131
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,879
The duel has a

132
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,520
variable for each constraint in the

133
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:36,279
primal and a constraint for each

134
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,279
variable in the primal. Dual

135
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
each

136
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:50,680
time the variable.

137
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,680
Oh, I'm sorry. I left out the

138
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,640
um non- negativity conditions. X1 and X3

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,640
are greater than equal to zero and X2 is

140
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,640
unconstrained.

141
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,760
So there's a

142
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,680
um dual variable

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,680
for each primal constraint.

144
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,839
Good.

145
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,160
And now what we did

146
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,800
was we um

147
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,800
took this

148
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,120
equa the inequalities multiplied them by

149
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,480
the new

150
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,680
variables in the duel and added them up.

151
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:57,279
So we have y1

152
00:09:49,680 --> 00:10:00,240
* x1 + x2 is less than equal to 8.

153
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,760
y 2 *

154
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,320
x1

155
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,240
- x3 is greater than equal to 1.

156
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,399
Y3

157
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,200
times

158
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,200
x2 + x3

159
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,680
= 4.

160
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
Okay.

161
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,720
And when we add them up, we want these

162
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,480
variables to or we want these

163
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,360
inequalities to all point the same way

164
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,480
because if we add, you know, x1 + x2

165
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,000
less or equal to 8 and x1 - x3 greater

166
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,600
than equal to 1, it doesn't tell us

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,360
anything. So that means that here we

168
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,079
have to have y1 greater equal to zero.

169
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
Here we want to flip the sign of this

170
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,079
inequality. So we need y2 less than or

171
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,600
equal to zero. And here

172
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,200
well it doesn't matter whether y3 is

173
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,800
bigger than or less than equal to zero

174
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
because when we multiply it there'll be

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,160
an equality and when we add them all up

176
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,552
it'll still be the right inequality. So

177
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,572
here we have y3 unconstrained.

178
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:22,572
[applause]

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay.

180
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,000
So going from

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,560
a less than or equal to sign and the

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,360
primal if the primal is a maximum

183
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,839
maximization gives you a positive

184
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,920
variable. A greater than equal to sign

185
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,640
if the primal is maximization gives you

186
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,000
a negative variable and an equal sign

187
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,000
gives you an unconstrained variable.

188
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,480
Okay.

189
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,200
So now

190
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,760
the um

191
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,560
and the

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,519
we remember we wanted to maximize 3x1 +

193
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,839
5 x2 - 2x3. So the first column

194
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,360
gives you

195
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,360
y1 + y2.

196
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,360
um

197
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,320
is greater than or equal to three.

198
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,200
The second column gives you y1

199
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,800
+ y3

200
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,040
is greater than or equal to

201
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,040
um five.

202
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,560
Is that right?

203
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,320
And the third column

204
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,000
gives you

205
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,200
-

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,200
y 2 + y3

207
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
is

208
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:12,160
- y 2 + y3 is greater than 2

209
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,320
um minus 2.

210
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,320
So these are the constraints of the

211
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,320
duel.

212
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,040
And similarly when you're going from the

213
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,240
dual to the primal everything works the

214
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,480
same way except

215
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,440
less than or equal to sign greater than

216
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,680
equal to signs turn into positive

217
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,240
variables. Less than equal to signs turn

218
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,160
into negative variables. And again equal

219
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,120
signs turn into unconstrained variables.

220
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,320
So, I don't like doing it this way.

221
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,800
Yeah. You have a question?

222
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,800
>> Oh, should yal?

223
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:58,440
>> Yes. Yes, it should. y1 + y3 equals 5.

224
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,440
Thank you.

225
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,720
Okay.

226
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,680
So, what what was I going to say? I was

227
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,560
going to say the reason I don't like

228
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,480
this is it gives you negative variables

229
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,279
and negative variables are hard to think

230
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,000
about and um when you're thinking about

231
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:25,639
them you're liable to make mistakes. So,

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,639
what I'm going to do is I'm going to um

233
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
yeah,

234
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,160
another way to take the tool.

235
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,959
First

236
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,639
make

237
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,800
all

238
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,519
equations

239
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,040
the correct

240
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,880
less than equal to or greater than equal

241
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,519
to the correct sign. So here what we

242
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,279
want to do is we want to take the second

243
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
equation and turn it into a less than

244
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,880
equal to sign because if we have a

245
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,560
maximization

246
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,839
and canonical form

247
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,160
you want less than equal signs. So that

248
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,160
turns into

249
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,760
3x1

250
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,760
+ 5 x2 - 2 x3

251
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,959
subject to

252
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:40,839
x1 + x2 less than or equal to 8

253
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,839
- x1 + x3

254
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:50,680
is less than or equal to minus1. X1

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,680
and X2 + X3 = 4.

256
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,440
And

257
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:12,120
I forgot to write down

258
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,120
X1 X2 greater than or equal to zero.

259
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,639
X3

260
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,440
no. X1 X3 greater than or equal to zero.

261
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,440
X2 unconstrained.

262
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,839
So now we can just you know write this

263
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,519
off. We take the transpose of the A

264
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:49,519
matrix which is

265
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,120
Y1 - Y 2

266
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,440
Y1

267
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,920
+ Y3

268
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,920
and Y2 + Y3

269
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
um

270
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,919
X

271
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,600
X2 was unconstrained. So this is an

272
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,160
equality

273
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:16,160
and x2 and x x3 and x1 both had greater

274
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,679
than equal to signs. So these are

275
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,640
um

276
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,240
less than or equal to signs.

277
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,120
um

278
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,120
the minimum

279
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,160
because the original the primal was

280
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,840
maximization, the dual is minimization.

281
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,520
And we just read off the right hand

282
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:41,200
sides of the

283
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:46,080
equations inequalities and we get 8 y1 -

284
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,000
y 2 + 4 y3.

285
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,160
And

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,679
we called this w. Not that it really

287
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,760
matters subject to

288
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,080
these things. And we take the

289
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,840
um original

290
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,760
objective functions and use it for the

291
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:11,080
right hand side. So 3 5 and minus two.

292
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,080
And finally

293
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:20,799
the third equation was an inequality. So

294
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:23,799
y1 y 2 gal to zero. and y3

295
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,799
unconstrained

296
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,760
and we don't have this

297
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,080
um hard to think about variable y2 less

298
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,080
than equal to zero.

299
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,640
So this is the way I like to take duals.

300
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,400
Okay. So the next thing I want to do is

301
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:56,080
talk about complimentary slackness.

302
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,080
Any questions about the material so far?

303
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Okay.

304
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,840
And um

305
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,400
complimentary slackness. We are going to

306
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
um

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,039
well why don't I write the theorem down

308
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,559
and then we'll prove it.

309
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,760
So again, we're going to have two linear

310
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,120
programs and

311
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,480
we're only going to prove it for the

312
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,640
we're going to prove it when the linear

313
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,600
programs are in canonical form. But in

314
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,080
general, you know, it's true for any

315
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,080
linear program.

316
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Um,

317
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
suppose

318
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,760
X is a feasible solution in the primal

319
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,760
and Y is a feasible solution in the

320
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
dual.

321
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,280
Then

322
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,080
X

323
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,039
is optimal

324
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,039
in primal

325
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:52,600
and

326
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,600
Y is optimal in dual.

327
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,360
If for all I either

328
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,039
y i = z

329
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,880
or a subx

330
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,880
i = b sub i. So this is either saying

331
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,799
the i variable in the duel is zero or

332
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,159
the i equation in the primal is

333
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,760
satisfied with equality.

334
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,400
And

335
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,880
for all J

336
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:38,520
either

337
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,520
X subj= Z or

338
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,480
A transpose Y

339
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:53,520
J = B subJ. So this is saying either the

340
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:56,760
J variable is zero or the J equation in

341
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,760
the dual.

342
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,640
Okay, this is not B, this is C.

343
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,400
Either the J equation and the J variable

344
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,200
is zero or the J equation in the dual is

345
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,200
satisfied with equality.

346
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,799
Okay.

347
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,679
So we'll prove it

348
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,679
and we'll only prove it for or rather we

349
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:30,320
will prove it for um

350
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,679
linear programs in the canonical form.

351
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,120
But because it's true for linear

352
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,880
programs in the canonical form, it's

353
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,880
automatically true for all linear

354
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,880
programs.

355
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,240
There's no reason you have to prove it

356
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,880
for an arbitrary linear program and it's

357
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,880
just extra notation.

358
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:02,720
Okay, so we should write down the

359
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,240
programs in the canonical form and um

360
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,559
maximum

361
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:12,480
Z = C transpose X

362
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:15,919
A X less than equal to B X greater than

363
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,679
equal to zero. This is the primal and

364
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,559
the dual is the minimum

365
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,600
w=

366
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,760
bpose y.

367
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,600
A transpose y = c is less than equal to

368
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,200
c

369
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,200
and y greater than equal to zero.

370
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,600
Okay. [clears throat]

371
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,600
So, what we have is

372
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,159
done.

373
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Well,

374
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,240
we have a transpose y is less than true

375
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,080
c.

376
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,559
So let's start with cranspose x. And now

377
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:28,679
let's plug this equation into here.

378
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,679
Cranspose x is less than or equal to

379
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:37,720
well cranspose is yrpose a. So this is

380
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,720
yranspose a x.

381
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,919
Now yrpose ax is equal to yrpose

382
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,400
ax

383
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,320
because the matrix multiplication is

384
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,840
associative

385
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,159
and we have ax less than equal to b. So

386
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,440
this says is less than equal to y

387
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,840
transpose b.

388
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,039
So this is just

389
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,039
weak duality.

390
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Suppose

391
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,320
both of these

392
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,320
both lesser equal to signs hold with

393
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,320
equality.

394
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,440
Well, then we know that for this to be

395
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,720
optimal, they these signs need to be

396
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,720
hold with equality. And if this holds

397
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,720
with equality,

398
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,720
well

399
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,039
then

400
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,279
um

401
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:47,520
let's rewrite this equation. yrpose A

402
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,960
minus C

403
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,960
X = 0.

404
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,679
Oh, this should be cranspose.

405
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,880
And let's rewrite this equation.

406
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,720
That's just

407
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,520
ypose

408
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,520
ax minus b equals z.

409
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,720
Okay.

410
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,320
So if we have two dotproducts of vectors

411
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,440
are zero and each of these

412
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,799
vectors contains only positive entries

413
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,000
then and every

414
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,520
every piece of the dotproduct one of

415
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
these two equals zero.

416
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:49,000
So y transpose i = z or

417
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
um

418
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,840
a x

419
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:01,000
sub

420
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,000
i equals b sub i.

421
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:10,640
And here it's just the same thing.

422
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,640
Either x j equals z or

423
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:18,279
Y transpose A J

424
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,279
transpose A

425
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:26,039
subj equals

426
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,039
C transpose J.

427
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,559
So this is one way of the ine equality

428
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,760
of the inequality. Now suppose the other

429
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:45,919
way holds that means either XJ equals Z

430
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:50,400
or YRPOSE a J= CJ. Well that means that

431
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:55,919
this product is zero which means that um

432
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,919
this is an equality. And similarly on

433
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,000
this side

434
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:04,799
if either this equals Z or this equals Z

435
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,799
then this dotproduct is zero. And that

436
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,279
means that this is an equality. So

437
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:14,559
cranspose x equals yrpose b which means

438
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,720
that the

439
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,840
um

440
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,279
that you know cranspose x and yrpose b

441
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,279
are optimal solutions.

442
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,279
Okay.

443
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,760
Now I want to go back here and

444
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,480
tell you something neat you can do with

445
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,480
complimentary slack.

446
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Okay.

447
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,080
So

448
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:57,360
x1 = 4

449
00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:00,919
x3 = 4 is a

450
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,919
feasible solution,

451
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,240
right? Because

452
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,159
4 + 4 less than or equal to 8

453
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,159
- 4 + 4 is what?

454
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,159
Um,

455
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:25,279
x1 + this is an x2, not an x3.

456
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,520
4 + 4 is less than 8.

457
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:32,159
-4,

458
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:36,320
I forgot. x3 = 0

459
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:41,039
-4 + 0 is less than equal to -1.

460
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:44,480
And 4 + 0 = 4.

461
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:48,600
So this is a feasible solution. And in

462
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,600
fact, it's the optimum solution.

463
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,000
And if you know it's the optimum

464
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,000
solution to the primal, you can use

465
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,360
complimentary slackness to find the

466
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,360
optimum solution to the duel.

467
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,399
So here we have two variables which are

468
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,320
not equal to zero which means we have

469
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,960
two equations

470
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,960
which are

471
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,360
satisfied with equality. So that means

472
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,039
that we must have

473
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,880
um

474
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,960
so the two variables which are not equal

475
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,320
to zero are the first and the second

476
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,559
which means the first and the second

477
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,240
equation are satisfied with equality. So

478
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,399
y1

479
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,559
= y2

480
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:58,000
okay I hope I'm doing this right.

481
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:03,120
No, I'm not doing it right because I

482
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,480
this equation is y1 - y2 is less equals

483
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:11,120
= 3. So y1

484
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:14,880
- y2 = 3 and y1

485
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:19,679
+ y3 = 5.

486
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,399
Now there's up here there's an equation

487
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,760
which is not satisfied with the equality

488
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,600
and the um

489
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:33,720
and the optimal solution. That's the

490
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,720
second equation which means y2 equals z.

491
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,360
And now you've written down these three

492
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
equations

493
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:49,080
and there are three unknowns so you can

494
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:49,080
solve it. And so y1 = 3 and y2 = 5.

495
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,120
And now you can plug this in and see

496
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,039
whether

497
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,919
this

498
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,519
equation for the primal and this or this

499
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,000
feasible solution for the primal and

500
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,760
this solution for the dual give you the

501
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,080
same

502
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:17,200
objective function. So let's do that. we

503
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:20,799
have x1 + x2 is 3 * 4 + 5 * 4 that's 32.

504
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,559
So objective function

505
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:29,320
32

506
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:29,320
and down here we have 24.

507
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,720
Okay, y1 = 3. I obviously did my

508
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,679
equations wrong. Y1 = 3 and Y Y Y Y Y Y

509
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,000
Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y 2 = 0. So

510
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:45,000
Y1= 3. And we have 3 + Y3 = 5. So Y3 =

511
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
2.

512
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:53,600
Apologies for my arithmetic.

513
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:58,960
So that means that we have

514
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:03,919
24 + 8 is 32.

515
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,320
Objective function equals 32.

516
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,159
So these

517
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,919
so this is an optimal solution for the

518
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,320
primal and this is an optimal solution

519
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,320
for the dual.

520
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,559
Okay.

521
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,679
So the last thing I want to do is give a

522
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,399
I don't know if I'm going to call it a

523
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:40,240
proof or not because

524
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,720
maybe I give a justification for

525
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,960
strong duality.

526
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,559
If you look online,

527
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,279
there are roughly

528
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,120
two kinds of proofs

529
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,960
or three kinds of proofs of strong

530
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,480
duality.

531
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:02,159
The first you define the simplex

532
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,039
algorithm which is a way of getting the

533
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,600
optimal solution for linear problems and

534
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,000
then when the simplex algorithm finishes

535
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,240
it gives you what's called tableau from

536
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,480
which you can read out the solution to

537
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,599
the primal you can read off the optimal

538
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,440
solution to the dual and then you can

539
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,960
stare at it and

540
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,879
use the um Well, you can stick, you

541
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,760
know,

542
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,560
no it tells you that the optimal

543
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,399
solution to the primal is equal to the

544
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:40,480
optimal solution to the dual.

545
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,960
So that's one way of proving um strong

546
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,280
duality and it's you know absolutely

547
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,599
rigorous. Another way of improving

548
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,720
strong duality is borrowing this lema

549
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,200
from analysis called Farcash's lema and

550
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,440
applying it. The problem with this is

551
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,359
that Faros's lema is basically strong

552
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,520
duality

553
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,040
in different notation.

554
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,280
So you haven't really

555
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,400
I mean I guess it's a proof if you

556
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,560
believe Farcash's lema but it doesn't

557
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,160
seem to give you any more real insight

558
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,359
than my just telling you that strong

559
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,240
duality holds because

560
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,240
that's what it's doing.

561
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,839
And the third

562
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,880
uses mechanics in n dimensions and we

563
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,800
need a few basic theorems for mechanics

564
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,280
and then we can prove strong duality.

565
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,040
So

566
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,880
I mean we have to accept these theorems

567
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,320
from mechanics. I don't know if there's

568
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,400
any way of going through mathematics and

569
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,920
proving that these mechan theorems from

570
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,839
mechanics really hold. But

571
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,640
if I mean if you accept the theorems

572
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,880
from mechanics then you absolutely have

573
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,760
a proof of strong duality and showing I

574
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,000
mean I find this really pretty amazing

575
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,839
showing that mechanics is consistent in

576
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,079
high dimensions

577
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,680
is the same thing in some sense as

578
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,320
proving strong duality of linear

579
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,040
programming which is a connection I

580
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,680
never would have accepted expected. So

581
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,720
we're going to pro give you the

582
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,720
justification from mechanics

583
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,520
and let's see.

584
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Um

585
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,720
So a linear program

586
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,920
set of hyperlinks.

587
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,440
THE CONSTRAINTS

588
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,839
the constraints say you're on one side

589
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,839
of the hyper plane.

590
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,280
and the objective function.

591
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,599
We want to find

592
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,599
feasible point

593
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,400
furthest

594
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:48,520
in direction of

595
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,520
objective function.

596
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,680
So what do we do? Well, we pretend each

597
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,920
of these hydroplanes is a solid

598
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,720
surface.

599
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,839
And

600
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,839
okay, this is a bad drawing.

601
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,680
And what we're going to do is we're

602
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,680
going to drop a ball

603
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,920
and gravity is going to take it in the

604
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,839
direction of the

605
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,520
increasing or decreasing objective

606
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,160
function

607
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,920
and it's going to hit this um hyper

608
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,680
plane. And now it's going to roll in

609
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,280
this direction and it's going to hit

610
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,079
this point. And now

611
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,599
we're going to assume

612
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,520
well

613
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,839
actually maybe we should make another

614
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,839
plane here.

615
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,560
It's going to roll down to here. And

616
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,160
this is the lowest point on the proper

617
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,560
side of all the hyperplanes. So it's

618
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,040
just going to sit there. And mechanics

619
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,160
tells us that the force of gravity on it

620
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,000
is balanced by the force

621
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,800
being pushed on this point perpendicular

622
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,960
to each hyper plane. So the sum of the

623
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,680
forces exerted on this ball by the

624
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,680
hyperplanes is equal to the force of

625
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,680
gravity.

626
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,440
And this

627
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,440
is a theorem for mechanics indeed.

628
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Okay.

629
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,920
So now let's write down the

630
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,200
um linear program

631
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,200
that solves this problem.

632
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,640
minimize

633
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
cranspose

634
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,440
x

635
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,440
subject to

636
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:43,040
ax is greater than equal to E.

637
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,760
And this is just saying the point

638
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,160
is on the correct side of every every

639
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,160
hyper plane.

640
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,800
And this is just the force of gravity.

641
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,560
You want to

642
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:11,359
make the point as low as possible.

643
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:14,079
And um well

644
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,079
x is a arbitrary point so x is

645
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,079
unconstrained.

646
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,520
Okay. So now we can ask what's the duel

647
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,400
of this problem.

648
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,960
So this is the primal.

649
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,560
the duel

650
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,119
well

651
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,240
it's going to be max

652
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,240
banspose y

653
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,480
and now all of these x's are

654
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,480
unconstrained.

655
00:41:52,079 --> 00:42:00,480
So that means all of these equations

656
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:07,240
must be in must be equalities. So we

657
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:07,240
have a transpose y equals c.

658
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,720
And

659
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,800
here we have a whole bunch of

660
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,680
inequalities which means we get y

661
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,680
greater than zero.

662
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:34,160
Okay. So this is the

663
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,079
linear program and its dual that we will

664
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,440
show

665
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,440
have the property of strong duality.

666
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,720
So, a hyper plane,

667
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,640
the equation was um I left out some

668
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,640
letters there.

669
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,720
The equation was um

670
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,079
a I1

671
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:43,599
X1 + A I2 X2 + dot dot dot + A I

672
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,200
N X subn

673
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,359
is

674
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,359
greater than or equal to B subi.

675
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,560
So what is the upward force on this

676
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,560
hyper plane?

677
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,480
Well, if you have a hyper plane and you

678
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,200
have a ball resting on the hyper plane,

679
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,839
the force on the ball is perpendicular

680
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,839
to the hyper plane.

681
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,520
So, it's in direction.

682
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:53,200
Um I want to say a i1

683
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,119
a i2 through a sub i n

684
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,640
and [clears throat]

685
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:01,520
you know if the it has to be positive so

686
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,560
it's some

687
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:10,960
constant c.

688
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:15,280
So the force is c a i1 through a sub i n

689
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,280
with c greater than zero.

690
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,160
Okay,

691
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,640
C is a bad number for this bad variable

692
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,680
for this. Let's see.

693
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:36,040
Let's call it F.

694
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,040
And I should probably call this F subi.

695
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,640
Okay.

696
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,599
Okay.

697
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,040
Okay.

698
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,040
So we have

699
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,160
we have

700
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,560
there

701
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,560
must be

702
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,000
some forces

703
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,800
and I'm going to call them y subi

704
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,880
instead of f subi just because

705
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,599
y subi is the right name for the

706
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,839
variable because it's a dual variable.

707
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,720
such that

708
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:54,560
summation.

709
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,680
Oh, wait.

710
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:02,480
such that

711
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:05,200
if v subi is equal to this direction a

712
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:09,880
i1 a i2

713
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,880
through a sub i n

714
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,599
then

715
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,079
summation v sub i

716
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,920
no if

717
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:26,520
yeah that's right then summation y sub i

718
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,520
v subi is equal to See

719
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,480
actually

720
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,480
maybe we should make this cranspose.

721
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,440
And because these forces all act away

722
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,200
from the hyper plane need

723
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,200
y subi

724
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,200
z.

725
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,040
Okay.

726
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,280
If

727
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:20,079
The ball

728
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:24,040
touches

729
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,040
the E hyper plane.

730
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,160
Then

731
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,800
a subi

732
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,000
if the

733
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,839
ball touches the e piper plane I'm going

734
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,839
to say ax

735
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:07,119
ax the i term of ax is equal to b subi

736
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,160
because if the ball touches the E hyper

737
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:13,440
plane then the constraint is satisfied

738
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:17,079
with equality and

739
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,079
this is true.

740
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,440
The ball

741
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,440
does not touch the hyper plane

742
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,640
then what's going on? The ball does not

743
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,640
touch the hyper plane

744
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,960
then

745
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,280
the hyper plane does not exert any force

746
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,280
on the ball.

747
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:55,119
then y sub i equals z.

748
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:59,040
And these two things are enough to give

749
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,119
you complimentary not are enough to I

750
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,440
mean these two things well first look a

751
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:08,520
lot like complimentary sness but they're

752
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,520
enough to give you strong duality.

753
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:11,779
[snorts]

754
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,839
Okay,

755
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,839
let

756
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:52,480
Okay, we have y subi

757
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,839
no y transpose

758
00:50:52,480 --> 00:51:01,000
ax [applause] minus b

759
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:01,000
is equal to y i

760
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:09,960
guess

761
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,960
summation y sub i ax minus B

762
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,559
and I want to claim either Yi equals Z

763
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,559
or AX subi equals B subi.

764
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:26,079
So this

765
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:29,119
equals zero.

766
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,839
Now this goes ypose

767
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:35,599
ax - b

768
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:39,359
equals z. And let's look back at the

769
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:42,160
linear program. And

770
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:45,160
we have

771
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,160
ypose

772
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,280
y equals c.

773
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,920
Right?

774
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,440
So

775
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,920
ypose a is cranspose.

776
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,920
So this says

777
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:10,079
oh this should be yranspose b. So I when

778
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:13,599
I took this I forgot to move the

779
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:17,920
yranspose into the parenthesis.

780
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:25,280
So this is cranspose x and so we have

781
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:31,319
cranspose x minus yanspose b = zero and

782
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,319
cranspose x = ypose bison.

783
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,760
Okay,

784
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,559
so that actually is the end of the

785
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,720
linear programming duality lecture notes

786
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,280
and I suspected I might have a little

787
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,960
time left. So I am going to tell you

788
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,440
about Kunig's theorem which is an

789
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,440
application of linear programming

790
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,440
duality.

791
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,960
And I did not prepare this as well. So

792
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:27,960
hopefully I won't make any mistakes

793
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,960
there.

794
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,839
Suppose you have a bipartite graph.

795
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:53,480
Okay.

796
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,480
So, let's draw an example.

797
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,920
Okay.

798
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,920
U matching

799
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,240
is a set of edges

800
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,400
that

801
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,160
do not

802
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:56,839
I want to say that do not

803
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,839
meet at any vertices.

804
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,520
So this

805
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,359
is one edge of a matching. This might be

806
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,520
another edge of the matching. This might

807
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,119
be another edge.

808
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,440
And

809
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,960
here's another edge.

810
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,960
So that's four edges in this matching.

811
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,800
Okay. Now I want to claim now I want to

812
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,800
define a vertex cover.

813
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,920
Vertex cover

814
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:13,000
is a set of vertices that intersect all

815
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,000
the EDGES

816
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,440
that meet all the edges.

817
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:29,440
So let's see what would a vertex cover

818
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:32,400
in this graph look like. Well,

819
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:35,040
you might use this vertex.

820
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,760
You might use this vertex.

821
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:39,440
You might use this vertex. And you might

822
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,040
use this vertex. Does this cover all the

823
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,520
edges? No, actually it doesn't. So let's

824
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,520
not use that vertex.

825
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,440
You could use this vertex.

826
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,480
And that actually does cover all the

827
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,480
edges because

828
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,680
Yeah.

829
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,680
Okay.

830
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,440
The

831
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,960
size

832
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,960
of the maximum matching

833
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,480
is equal to the size of the minimum

834
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,480
vertex cover.

835
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:28,014
[applause]

836
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:39,960
Okay. So what we have here is we have

837
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,640
yeah we have four in each of them. So

838
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:51,920
this is an example where equality holds

839
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,880
and the Kix theorem says equality holds

840
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:59,720
in all graphs

841
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,720
and there's one which

842
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,799
one direction is easy

843
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:18,200
size

844
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:18,200
of Any vertex cover

845
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:24,520
has to be bigger than equal to the size

846
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,520
of any matching.

847
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,000
And why is this?

848
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:39,200
Well,

849
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,440
I mean a vertex cover has to cover each

850
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,760
of the edges in the matching, which

851
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,760
means it has to be one of the end points

852
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,440
of the each of the edges of the has to

853
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,599
contain one of the end points in each of

854
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,240
the edges of the matching which means

855
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,119
that it's

856
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,920
has to be the size of the maximum

857
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,240
matching at least

858
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,240
and Kig's theorem says that they're

859
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,240
equal.

860
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:14,359
Okay.

861
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:23,920
So, how do we prove equality?

862
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:27,200
Well, one way to do it is write down a

863
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:29,839
linear program for the maximum matching.

864
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,359
write down a linear program for vertex

865
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:34,000
covers.

866
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,520
Show that they're duals and then show

867
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,520
that

868
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,799
there is an integer solution to each of

869
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,280
them.

870
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:45,839
So I do not have time to do all of that,

871
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:48,720
but we can at least write down the

872
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:54,520
um

873
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:54,520
the theorem for the maximum matching

874
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,720
the

875
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:13,000
So how are we going to write down

876
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
uh

877
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:19,040
how are we going to write down a linear

878
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:23,079
program for the maximum matching?

879
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,079
What should the variables be?

880
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:39,960
Edges maybe.

881
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,960
Okay.

882
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,799
Um,

883
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,599
so we want to maximize

884
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:03,079
the sum of

885
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,079
x sub.

886
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,599
Okay.

887
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:15,520
And now we want to say that

888
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,079
at most one of these edges, if we have a

889
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,160
vertex here, we want to say at most one

890
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,720
of these edges is present in the

891
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,799
matching. And we're not going to be able

892
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,799
to do that because these are not integer

893
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:32,240
variables. They're real numbers. But

894
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:37,119
let's um write down zero less than x

895
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:39,920
less than one and summation

896
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,760
e

897
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:48,079
okay v is contained in e. So for every

898
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:51,040
vertex the um

899
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,200
the edg the verticy the edges containing

900
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:59,559
that vertex

901
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:59,559
x sub is less than equal to one. So this

902
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,079
is something like

903
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:10,680
there's at most one

904
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,680
edge containing every vertex

905
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,520
which means that we do not have two

906
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,520
vertices two edges intersecting in a

907
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,440
vertex and are matching assuming the

908
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,760
matching is

909
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,079
assuming that all the variables are zero

910
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,760
or one and that's exactly the um

911
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,760
criterion for the match maximum

912
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,760
matching.

913
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,280
Okay.

914
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:41,640
Um

915
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,640
let's find the duel.

916
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:49,680
Well, the duel I mean we have an

917
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:53,200
equation for every vertex

918
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,520
and some extra equations

919
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,079
and a maximization. So the duo is going

920
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:02,480
to be a minimization. It's going to have

921
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,880
an equation, a variable for every

922
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,880
edge and it's going to have some extra

923
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,880
variables

924
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,400
dual. Um,

925
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,400
okay.

926
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,559
So

927
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,720
one constraint

928
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,440
per edge

929
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,799
and here we have

930
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,799
one per vertex.

931
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,359
Here we have extra per strength

932
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,280
per edge.

933
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,960
And

934
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:53,559
I guess we can also

935
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,559
have non- negativeity constraints.

936
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:23,000
So let's see the duo is going to have um

937
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,000
I should write down what these

938
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:29,760
equations what these variables are dual

939
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:32,000
let's call this

940
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:36,880
y sub

941
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,880
d and z sub e the equations

942
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:50,039
Um,

943
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,039
so

944
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,839
now

945
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:04,720
dual

946
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,559
equation

947
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:11,640
for

948
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:11,640
each or inequality I should say

949
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:22,280
for each

950
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,280
um edge.

951
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,599
And what are these inequalities going to

952
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:35,359
be? Well, y subv appears in

953
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:37,039
the equation for x subb

954
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:40,799
and

955
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,880
z sub appears in the equation for x

956
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:47,960
subb.

957
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,960
So that means that

958
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,079
y subb plus

959
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,200
z subb

960
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:09,799
well let's see minimum

961
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,799
summation y subd

962
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:19,119
y sub plus Z subb

963
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:23,160
is less than or equal to

964
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,160
um what

965
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:41,160
this is greater than uncle

966
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,160
I'm Sorry.

967
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:50,359
And um

968
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,359
YV and Z sub.

969
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:06,359
So what does this really mean?

970
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:06,359
Well,

971
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,039
what you want

972
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:15,000
is

973
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,000
you want uh

974
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,440
a vertex cover, which means you want a

975
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:22,680
set of vertices that are adjacent to

976
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,680
every edge.

977
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,880
Um

978
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:39,960
okay, so actually we I I did that wrong.

979
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,960
Minimize y subb plus z sub

980
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:55,839
because the right hand sides are one for

981
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:58,839
y subb and one for z subb.

982
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,839
Um

983
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,839
okay.

984
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,720
Okay, I seem to be I seem to have gotten

985
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:13,142
myself lost here,

986
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:16,560
but um I can go back and talk more about

987
01:08:13,142 --> 01:08:20,359
[clears throat] the program for um

988
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,359
the primal program.

989
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:30,120
Um and why the primal program is um

990
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,960
yeah so that's the primal program up

991
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,960
here.

992
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:47,080
So the primal program

993
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:57,120
a solution

994
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:59,279
is a

995
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,920
weight

996
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,920
on each edge.

997
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,520
So sum of the weights

998
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,679
we e

999
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:16,480
d and e

1000
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:20,600
um

1001
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,600
is less than or equal to one.

1002
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:28,319
So suppose we have um fractional

1003
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:32,679
solutions

1004
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,679
that means that there's some edge

1005
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:39,600
where

1006
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:42,239
you might have two some vertices where

1007
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:46,080
you might have two edges which have 0.5

1008
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:48,960
going out of it. Now

1009
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,799
um we might have another edge going out

1010
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,640
of 0.5 out of this one because

1011
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:58,480
this plus this is lesser equal to one

1012
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:00,800
and we want to maximize it. So we would

1013
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:04,719
have another one

1014
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:07,440
going up. So um and this might be 0.25

1015
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:11,600
and

1016
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:16,280
um let's put one up here. Um maybe

1017
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,280
another 0.5 and another.5.

1018
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,268
Okay. [cough]

1019
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:20,268
[clears throat]

1020
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:25,000
In a fractional solution,

1021
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,320
you can always find

1022
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:42,520
find a cycle

1023
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,520
of fractional edges,

1024
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,520
right?

1025
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,400
Because

1026
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,800
um

1027
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:58,320
well

1028
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,640
I mean if you do cannot find a fra if

1029
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,040
you find a cycle of fractional edges

1030
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:07,760
what you can do is you can increase the

1031
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:11,840
even ones and decrease the odd ones and

1032
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:16,080
set one of them equal to zero and always

1033
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:19,080
get a better solution.

1034
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,080
Ah,

1035
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,880
hey.

1036
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,000
And first all of these cycles are even

1037
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:57,040
because

1038
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,840
this is a bipartite graph. So that means

1039
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,159
we can increase the odd ones and

1040
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:06,080
decrease the even ones and we get one

1041
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:10,080
zero one zero one zero

1042
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:12,159
and it has the same objective

1043
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:16,360
function

1044
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,360
and zero fractional EDGES

1045
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,520
and doing this we can always get rid of

1046
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:28,880
the fractional edges.

1047
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:32,520
Now there's another possibility which is

1048
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,520
you know you have 0.5

1049
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,679
and what you can do is you can now

1050
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,679
increase this one to one decrease this

1051
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:45,320
to zero increase this one to one

1052
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,320
decrease this to zero and um

1053
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:00,560
And because if you can find a path, that

1054
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,120
would mean that this vertex does not

1055
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,719
have any fractional edges next to it

1056
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,239
aside from this one. And this vertex

1057
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,560
does not have any fractional edges next

1058
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:12,080
to it besides this one. And that means

1059
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:15,600
that you can increase the odd edges and

1060
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,760
decrease the even edges. And

1061
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,360
either you um end up with the same

1062
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,440
objective function or you increase the

1063
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,239
objective function. But we were assuming

1064
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,159
this was optimal. So you always end up

1065
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,760
with the same objective function. So you

1066
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:31,679
can always decrease the number of

1067
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,600
fractional edges and

1068
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,080
keep the same objective function which

1069
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,679
means that eventually you find a

1070
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:42,239
solution where there are no fractional

1071
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,920
edges and that is your

1072
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:46,159
maximum matching that you wanted to

1073
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,800
find.

1074
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:53,040
And if you take the duel of this and

1075
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:56,400
stare at the duel, you will see that it

1076
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,760
gives you, and I screwed that up when I

1077
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,840
was trying to do it, but it will tell

1078
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,080
you, you will see that it gives you a

1079
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,760
vertex cover. And again, you can have a

1080
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,120
fractional vertex cover, but a very

1081
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,440
similar argument will tell you that you

1082
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:11,920
have

1083
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,920
you can find a optimal vertex cover,

1084
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,640
which is an integer solution to the

1085
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:19,199
linear program. And that shows Kunig's

1086
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,040
theorem.

1087
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,040
And we will be doing things that are

1088
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:27,040
more like this,

1089
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:29,840
you know, taking linear programs for um

1090
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:34,320
interesting problems. And we will do

1091
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:39,280
this with zero sum gains and maximum

1092
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:42,800
flow. And show first that the

1093
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,640
fractional solutions can always be

1094
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,280
um

1095
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,800
massaged to give you inter solutions for

1096
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:53,840
maximum for maximum flow. And this will

1097
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,560
tell us give us a duality theorem that

1098
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:00,000
the maximum flow equals the minimum cut.

1099
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:05,440
And for zero sum games,

1100
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:08,800
you know, a game is a two player um

1101
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:11,520
thing. And we will show that the linear

1102
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,920
the primal linear program gives you the

1103
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:16,640
optimal strategy for the first player

1104
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,640
and the

1105
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,120
dual linear program gives you the

1106
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:25,920
optimal strategy for the second player.

1107
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:28,159
And because they are duels, they have

1108
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,360
the same objective function. And that

1109
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:33,199
tells us that they if the first player

1110
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:37,679
plays his optimum of strategy, he can

1111
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:39,280
always guarantee a win of say W on each

1112
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,760
turn

1113
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,440
on average. And if the second player

1114
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,520
plays his optimal strategy, he can

1115
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:48,880
always

1116
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,440
um achieve a loss of at most W on each

1117
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:53,360
turn. So the first player and the second

1118
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:56,719
player,

1119
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,800
you know, first player can guarantee he

1120
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:01,679
wins plus W and the second player can

1121
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:07,320
guarantee he loses no more than minus W.

1122
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:07,320
And so this is the value of the game.
