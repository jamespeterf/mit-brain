1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,759
okay um so I'm uh Kevin O'Brien

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,679
associate professor in ECS here and I'm

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,360
going to tell you about Quantum circuits

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,400
or you can think of this as diving

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,160
deeper into the physical system that

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,400
will Oliver talked about um earlier this

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,000
this morning um and I want to talk about

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,080
some of the challenges associated with

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,599
this field and some of the solutions

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,439
that that we can um create using our our

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,400
research here so at a high level I want

12
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,560
to talk about how um we can go from this

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,000
stage of of quantum Computing which will

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,600
Oliver was likening to the the First

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,559
Flight of the um of the right flyer um

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,039
to the stage of commercial use

17
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,399
commercially useful applications and

18
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,559
what kinds of technological improvements

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,879
particularly what kinds of basic

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,960
research improvements uh do we need to

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,640
go uh from the current level of of

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,800
quantum computers to this commercially

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,680
useful

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,079
stage and one thing that you you know

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,840
heard this morning but I want to

26
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,519
emphasize is that Quantum Computing is

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,280
really happening now the current

28
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,519
state-of-the-art uh we have a few

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,240
hundred non-air corrected Quantum uh

30
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,720
cubits these are real quantum computers

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,560
they're perhaps not uh capable of doing

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,439
useful computation yet um for practical

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,200
applications it's thought that we will

34
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,799
need hundreds to thousands of error

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,280
corrected cubits Each of which will be

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,079
made of a number of non-error corrected

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
cubits and here's a couple of the uh

38
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,799
public commercial companies uh building

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,799
these these

40
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,720
chips and you might ask is is quantum

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,960
Computing physics or or is it

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,960
engineering and you know you can look

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,040
online and you can find data sheets for

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,479
quantum computers so we're seeing that

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,840
there's a there's indeed a transition to

46
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,719
engineering um but and another thing to

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,079
emphasize is that quantity and quality

48
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,040
are are both required you need a large

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,079
number of cubits and you need cubits

50
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,200
with a very low error rate

51
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,640
and small numbers of cubits with high

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,719
error rates um even with low error rates

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,960
this is something that you can

54
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,399
classically simulate very easily on a a

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,679
laptop as as arum was was telling you

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,680
earlier as you increase the number of

57
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,040
cubits um it's thought that there there

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,200
may or may not be uh near-term

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,840
applications in this so-called nisk era

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,560
but as you increase the number of cubits

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,040
as you um Implement error correction

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,000
then we can utilize the the known useful

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,360
error corrected um Quantum

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,760
algorithms uh but we have a long ways to

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,800
go to to get to this point

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,319
how far do we have to go well it depends

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,360
on your assumptions and these

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,720
assumptions are constantly changing if

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,640
you for example assume a a 2d nearest

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
neighbor connectivity a surface code

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,319
Gates applied at 10 MHz error rate of

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,879
10us 5 um in this 2018 uh Quantum

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,239
competing progress and uh prospects

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,920
National Academy's report it was

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,519
estimated that it would take 10 the 6 to

76
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,879
10 the 7 physical cubits to do something

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
like break RSA using uh Shores algorithm

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,920
and as you

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,319
uh as the physical cubits improve as the

80
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,040
quantum error correction algorithms

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,560
improve then then these assumptions may

82
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,879
change and the number of cubits may be

83
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,560
may be smaller but this is really orders

84
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,400
of magnitude beyond the current

85
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,840
state-of-the-art but not so far that

86
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,680
it's not in that it's infeasible so it's

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,879
so it's a really exciting time to be in

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,720
this research

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,319
field now how can we transition quantum

90
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,159
computers from physics experiments into

91
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,439
useful products it's a bit of an

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,920
electrical engineering joke do you just

93
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,560
sub I with minus J uh but more seriously

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,599
uh Quantum Computing really needs

95
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,040
engineers and their talents and experti

96
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,599
to to get to this level um this talk is

97
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,200
going to focus a lot on electrical

98
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,480
engineering because I'm in the

99
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,840
electrical engineering computer science

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,280
department but really all varieties of

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,239
of engineering experience are are

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,200
critically important in in making this

103
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,680
transition so I'm going to EMP I'm going

104
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,879
to talk about some of the the research

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
in my group and how that um interfaces

106
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,920
with superc conducting Quantum Computing

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,480
and some of the questions that um we're

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,599
really interested in is what are the

109
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,040
fundamental limits on system performance

110
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,840
imposed by quantum mechanics how can we

111
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,879
engineer systems to reach these limits

112
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,319
and can can these limits be surpassed

113
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,000
can are we missing some tricks in

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,120
quantum mechanics that that allow us to

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,040
do better than than

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,040
that so Ike showed you some uh Ike and

117
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,960
will showed you some images of of superc

118
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,560
conducting quantum computers um with

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,639
lots of wires going up uh up and down

120
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,320
the the cryostat this stage is probably

121
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,360
at 10 to 20 Melvin the stages are

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,479
progressively warmer in operation of

123
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,479
course these have metal metal canisters

124
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,360
like matoska d you know like a matoska

125
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,520
dowel um isolating each of the lower

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,440
temperature stages from the higher

127
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,720
temperature stages and lots of wires

128
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,720
going back and

129
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,240
forth and one one thing that I don't

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,280
know if it's it's uh clear to people

131
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,320
outside the field is that the quantum

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,800
processors themselves the chips they're

133
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,960
only a few centimeters by a few

134
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,800
centimeters on on a side the the rest of

135
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,840
this is just control and measurement

136
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,520
infrastructure so anything that we can

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,080
do and this is this is only for order of

138
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,759
hundreds of cubits um the whereas we're

139
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,080
going to need Millions so there are

140
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,600
massive improvements to the

141
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,080
infrastructure that that are needed um

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,720
and some of these pieces of

143
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,960
infrastructure they interact in in

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,120
really detrimental ways for example your

145
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,759
cubits are extremely sensitive to

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,880
magnetic fields whereas the circulators

147
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,800
and isolators required to protect uh

148
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,360
components from each other they have

149
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,800
they generate strong magnetic fields um

150
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,560
we also need massive infrastructure

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,360
improvements to Multiplex cubic control

152
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,440
and measurement develop non-magnetic

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
isolators and circulators cryogenic

154
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440
control Hardware as as Ike was talking

155
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
about placing instead of having wires

156
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,720
going up and down these fridges placing

157
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,560
the control Hardware at one of these

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
lower stages um so I'm going to talk

159
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,080
about the measurement problem and some

160
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,759
of the ways in which you can develop

161
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,199
amplifiers to Multiplex these

162
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,240
measurements um to reduce the burden of

163
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,680
the the measurement chain so first I

164
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,360
want to ask how do you measure a

165
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,120
superconducting

166
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,479
cubit so as as background you may

167
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,720
remember this from the first talk but

168
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll I'll review it um if you make an LC

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,560
resonator or LC oscillator um looking at

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,919
this Quantum mechanically it will have

171
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,160
discrete energy levels and this is not a

172
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:26,599
cubit this has equally spaced energy

173
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,319
levels well this this is not uh a cubit

174
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,280
in the way that we would typically use

175
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,120
it because these energy levels are

176
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,360
equally spaced so when you apply a

177
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,039
microwave drive you end up exciting a

178
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,840
bunch of different levels um and you

179
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,840
excite a a coherent state in this

180
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,680
resonator which looks like a classical

181
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,919
state in the in the in this resonator so

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,280
something that will um energy will

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,639
oscillate back and forth between the

184
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,880
electric and magnetic fields at a

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,080
certain frequency to turn this into a

186
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,360
cubit we use something called the Joseph

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
injunction which for the purpose of this

188
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,360
talk you can think of as a nonlinear

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,720
inductor where um the current phase

190
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,240
relationship

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,280
uh uh defining the inductance normally

192
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,160
for a linear inductor the the current is

193
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,520
related to the flux through the inductor

194
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,080
by one over the inductance in a JIS

195
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,080
injunction it's related by the this

196
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,479
Factor we call the the Jose and

197
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,240
inductance divided by this cosine of of

198
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,599
fi and that cosine of fi when when fi

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,319
gets large enough this creates

200
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,680
nonlinearity and this is the ingredient

201
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,000
that we need to to make cubits and as

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,000
we'll we'll talk about later this is

203
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,360
also the ingredient we use to to build

204
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,639
amplifiers to measure the

205
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,160
cubits so when we replace that linear

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,840
inductor with a josus injunction then

207
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,280
the level spacing becomes not equal so

208
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,599
notice that this level spacing is

209
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,199
different than this level spacing is

210
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,240
different than this level spacing so you

211
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,440
can apply a microwave drive and excite

212
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,319
the Cubit from 0o to one and vice versa

213
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,720
or excite it into super position states

214
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,720
of of 0o and

215
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,720
one and there are lots of Engineering

216
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,400
trade-offs in how how you design this

217
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,159
this and harmonicity so now we see these

218
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,720
two ingredients this resonator and this

219
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:10,000
Cubit now you might ask how do you how

220
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,680
do you measure the state of a cubit

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,840
using one of these resonators and my my

222
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,919
students uh nor the organizers would let

223
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,400
me bring a delution refrigerator uh on

224
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,440
stage with me but I I do have something

225
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:27,120
maybe almost as good so I brought with

226
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,039
me um this this aluminum beverage can um

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,639
and I'm I have connected to it something

228
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,360
called a nanov Vector Network analyzer

229
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,640
um this is sort of borrowing from a demo

230
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,640
of a um electromagnetic engineering

231
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,399
class that I teach with Luca Daniel and

232
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,320
um and Yelena notos previous speaker um

233
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,519
and what it does is it sends out uh

234
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,279
microwaves at different frequencies and

235
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,200
measures the the the reflected response

236
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,760
and what I'm plotting here is the

237
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,760
amplitude of the

238
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,160
response as a function of frequency from

239
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,600
2.1 65 GHz to 2.2 GHz as well as the

240
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,680
phase of the response and we see that

241
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,040
there's this dip here and this dip is

242
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,320
associated with the Resonance of the of

243
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,160
this resonator

244
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,040
and the way you measure a cubit is you

245
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,519
you you can actually put the Cubit

246
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,079
inside of this resonator and that's

247
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,000
actually how people did it when the

248
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,519
field first started they would build 3D

249
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,200
resonators and physically put the Cubit

250
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,200
inside of it and the Cubit and the

251
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
resonator they they interact through

252
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,000
this some of the nonlinearity of the

253
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,920
Cubit it's inherited by this Cubit

254
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,680
resonator interaction and it causes the

255
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,480
resonator frequency to shift depending

256
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,040
on the state of the Cubit so if it's in

257
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,000
the cubits in the in the ground state

258
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
it'll be one one frequency it's in the

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,360
excited state it'll be a different

260
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,880
frequency and this is really similar to

261
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,040
if I take this can and I just squeeze it

262
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,880
a little bit notice the can is Shifting

263
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,920
in response to my uh my squeezing it oh

264
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,000
okay I think I deformed the can now it's

265
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,200
never going back to to where it was but

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
you can see that this can is is a really

267
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,880
sensitive probe of my fingers touching

268
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,079
the can and this is similar to how you

269
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,079
measure a cubid except now it's a very

270
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,880
sensitive probe of the the state of a

271
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,760
cubit and originally the Cubit may be in

272
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,120
a superp position it may be in zero it

273
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,399
may be in one it may be in a superp

274
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,480
position of zero and one and that means

275
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,600
that your can may be in one one

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,120
frequency the other frequency or a

277
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,000
superposition of these frequencies

278
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,920
because the Cubit and the can are

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,360
entangled so typically you don't measure

280
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,880
this by sweeping the frequency across

281
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,120
typically you pick one

282
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,680
frequency and send that in in the form

283
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,320
of a pulse into your system and then

284
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,880
gradually you acquire more information

285
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,839
about the state of the the can the

286
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,040
resonator probably wouldn't use a can in

287
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,519
a real experiment um and then that

288
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,160
collapses the state of the Cubit

289
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,399
resonator system into the state of the

290
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,720
Canon one frequency the cubit in zero or

291
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,279
the canon in another frequency that

292
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,000
cubit in in

293
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,279
one but to do this you need to use a

294
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,279
very small amount of power because using

295
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,200
more than a few photons in this can um

296
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,600
in this resonator it disturbs the state

297
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,680
of the cubit in a way that um it doesn't

298
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,160
retain the state that it collapses to

299
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,920
after you measure it and this is bad for

300
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,880
error correction this is a you want your

301
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,680
uh measurement at this property of being

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,360
uh qu Quantum non-demolition

303
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,959
and so that means you need to use this

304
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,680
this really small amount of power which

305
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,600
creates um a lot of practical challenges

306
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,120
so let's um let's shift back to the

307
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,639
slides unless there are any questions

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,800
about this are there any questions about

309
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,160
this demo before we we go back to the

310
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,200
the

311
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:45,240
slides okay so how do you go from

312
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,720
the oh uh it's a good question so um so

313
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,560
uh from the can so we have this this

314
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,279
instrument called a vector Network

315
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,320
analyzer that's connected up to the can

316
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,760
with this microwave cable and it's

317
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,279
sending in these uh microwaves and it's

318
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,160
measuring the reflected response so

319
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,079
what's plotted in the upper left is the

320
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,040
uh S11 or the reflection of of from the

321
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:11,200
can on a a logarithmic uh scale the

322
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,959
absolute value of that uh 10 log log 10

323
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,440
of that absolute value squared and away

324
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,279
from resonance you you get about the

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,440
same amount of power back as you're

326
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,480
sending in but as you approach resonance

327
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,839
then you see that a lot of the power is

328
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,199
absorbed um uh but I guess uh I don't

329
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,079
know maybe if your question was like

330
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,360
operationally how you how do you do that

331
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,480
it's just some um some Julia code that I

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
wrote that um takes the data from the

333
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,320
vector Network analyzer processes it and

334
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,440
and shows it on here does that answer

335
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,680
your question yes okay great uh any

336
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,680
other

337
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,560
questions okay so if we shift back to

338
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,320
the quantum system we have the cubit

339
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,880
coupled to a resonator we send in

340
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,680
microwaves at 10 Melvin we measure the

341
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,800
reflective response and we see exactly

342
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,880
that same effect where depending on the

343
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,560
the Cubit State the resonator will shift

344
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
it will acquire have an amplitude and a

345
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,000
phase response and you can plot that

346
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,120
just like we were doing on the IQ plane

347
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,160
and you can see these these two blobs

348
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,560
one associated with the um with the

349
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,959
ground state and the other associated

350
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,760
with the excited state but the challenge

351
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,839
of doing this is that you want to do

352
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,600
this really really fast and you want to

353
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,720
do this with very high fidelity and you

354
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,240
want to use uh very small power levels

355
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,160
so measuring small power levels is not

356
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,040
unknown to microwave engineering your

357
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,480
your GPS signals are say minus 140 - 150

358
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,240
dbm but you can't measure your G your

359
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,360
can't your phone can't acquire a GPS

360
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,040
lock in in 100 NS so we need something

361
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,160
special to to do this and I'm going to

362
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,160
tell you what

363
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,839
um what what we need um but first I want

364
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,920
to make an analogy with the analog

365
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,120
measurement chain in daily life so let's

366
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,000
say you you want to play some music uh

367
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,680
play play the guitar and you want to

368
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,120
share it with someone else that's that's

369
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,839
remote um you could use an electrical

370
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,839
microphone to transduce this acoustic

371
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,720
signal into an electrical signal this

372
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,399
will have some noise associated with it

373
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,360
it's actually black body

374
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,160
radiation and you'll have a place a

375
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,600
preamplifier to increase the amplitude

376
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,519
of that that preamplifier will add some

377
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,600
of its own noise as well as amplify the

378
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,000
input noise then you'll you'll send this

379
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,480
to a uh a secondary amplifier and then

380
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,320
to an analog to digital converter

381
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,079
digitize that have it on your computer

382
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,600
save it maybe email it to to someone um

383
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,279
but this ultra low noise pre preamp is

384
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,800
quite critical because any noise

385
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,880
injected by this preamp it gets um it it

386
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,240
carries through the rest of the

387
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,240
measurement chain now to imagine how

388
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,320
this is with superconducting cubits

389
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,920
imagine that your microwave emits single

390
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,120
Photon level signals and your analog to

391
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,600
digital converter is 30,000 times hotter

392
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,279
than your your microphone so that's

393
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,079
that's similar to the Cubit measurement

394
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,680
uh chain where you have the Cubit and

395
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,759
the redout resonator you're sending in

396
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,320
around minus 140

397
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,519
dbm at 10 Melvin you have a a first

398
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,720
Quantum limited pre-amplifier and then a

399
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,920
secondary amplifier and then you measure

400
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
it at at 300 Kelvin and perform the

401
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,839
Cubit State

402
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,759
classification the the challenges of

403
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,480
this are first that you want to perform

404
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,040
these measurements very quickly you're

405
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,279
limited to single Photon levels and

406
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,560
second the the cubits are extremely

407
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,319
sensitive to Photon thermal photons or

408
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,680
other photons in the resonator for

409
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,399
example to get a state-of-the-art

410
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,279
coherence time like those that um Google

411
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,199
IBM Etc use you need an average number

412
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:55,399
of photons in your resonator uh nbar of

413
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,160
less than 0.0 uh 02 so two two parts in

414
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,680
a thousand of a photon on average in

415
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,920
your resonator you need less than that

416
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,839
to to achieve the coherence time and the

417
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,680
re the way to think about that is that

418
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
your Cubit is measured by photons in

419
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,160
your resonator and your Cubit doesn't

420
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,000
care if you're sending in those photons

421
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,959
intentionally or whether those photons

422
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
are from thermal fluctuations or or

423
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:20,680
something else they they all measure the

424
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:23,800
Cubit and at 4K 4 Kelvin um There are 16

425
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,480
photons uh in every single mode and at

426
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,800
room temperature they're about a

427
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,759
thousand so actually in this can if I

428
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,680
take it and I disconnect conect it from

429
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,959
The

430
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,240
Source this is a can of photons where

431
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,199
every mode will have about 3,000 photons

432
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,480
in it so people often ask you know if

433
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,560
there were room temperature

434
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,959
superconductors could you operate a a

435
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,800
quantum computer at room temperature and

436
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,519
at least if you're operating at say sub

437
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,800
10 GHz the answer is no you you couldn't

438
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,839
because the thermop photons would

439
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,440
completely swamp the

440
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:59,319
operation okay um so how do we actually

441
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,319
perform that readout you might say just

442
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,120
go and buy a semiconductor amplifier if

443
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:05,799
any of you work in uh RF or or something

444
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,400
like that you can you can go online you

445
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,360
can order a really good um semiconductor

446
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,280
amplifier but it turns out that if you

447
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,120
cool these down these can't achieve

448
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,760
Quantum limited noise performance

449
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,600
they're typically a factor of three

450
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,079
usually uh uh more uh away from the

451
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,799
so-called Quantum limit which is the

452
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:27,600
best an amplifier can possibly perform

453
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:29,280
and this turns out um if we um take a

454
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,679
look at some of the papers by by experts

455
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,600
in this that it results from the the

456
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,240
challenges of cooling down uh

457
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,080
dissipating the heat generated by these

458
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,919
transistor base amplifiers as you go to

459
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,039
lower temperatures because as you go to

460
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,960
lower temperatures there are fewer

461
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,880
phonons to help dissipate the heat so it

462
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,400
becomes more challenging but fortunately

463
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,000
um we can use the nonlinearity that

464
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,480
creates the Cubit to create amplifiers

465
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,280
and I I don't know if I'm brave enough

466
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,480
to do this like full demo uh here but I

467
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,360
can I can give you a little sense of it

468
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,640
so I

469
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,080
brought demo of a parametric amplifier

470
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
that's a little bit entangled with my

471
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,240
keys

472
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,880
um so you can think of this as a

473
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,440
parametric amplifier uh all it needs is

474
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,640
some oscillation and some

475
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,440
nonlinearity and you know if I want to

476
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,880
make this move I can just push it and

477
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,880
it'll it'll start oscillating but that's

478
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,080
very inconvenient to do in the base of a

479
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,919
dilution refrigerator but what you can

480
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,159
do is if you imagine this as the

481
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,080
microwave you want to amplify and then

482
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,280
you you send in a a pump wave that

483
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,760
changes some parameter of the system

484
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,520
here I'm going to change the length of

485
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,600
this string in the Joseph injunction

486
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,320
based systems you send in a strong

487
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,480
microwave pump that changes the

488
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,320
properties of the Joseph injunction and

489
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,159
what that does is using this this

490
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,679
analogy As you move the oscillator up

491
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,520
here you pull up on the string and then

492
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,320
as the mass is going down you let it out

493
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,600
you let that extra string out and then

494
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,600
every time it oscillates it falls a

495
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,159
little bit further effectively and that

496
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,440
adds energy to the um uh to the

497
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,880
system yeah it usually takes me a little

498
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,400
bit to actually do this with the the

499
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
spring and mass so I won't do it here

500
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,600
but maybe we can play around with it

501
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,880
later um but going back to the super

502
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,880
conducting circuits um people can make

503
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,039
essentially perfect amplifiers using

504
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,400
something called a josein parametric

505
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,039
amplifier which is the same physical

506
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
structure Ure as the super conducting

507
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,480
Cubit where it has a capacitor in

508
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
parallel with the nonlinear inductor and

509
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,960
then it's driven by a strong microwave

510
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,679
pump and this creates a gain in a in a

511
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,880
relatively narrow tens to hundreds of

512
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,000
megahertz uh bandwidth

513
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,159
regime but to reduce the physical

514
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,400
Hardware overhead we really want to um

515
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:55,200
amplify over a very broad bandwidth and

516
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,840
you can do this by chaining together a

517
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,640
bunch of these uh joses injunctions to

518
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,240
create a transmission line and this

519
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,760
doesn't have a specific frequency

520
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,080
associated with it so it can amplify

521
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,240
over a very broad bandwidth um

522
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,799
and but the question is can they reach

523
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,120
the quantum limit and this is something

524
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,039
that that I I find a very uh interesting

525
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,679
question um these amplifiers have been

526
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,919
demonstrated in a lot of different uh

527
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,520
systems but so far none of them have

528
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,799
really reached Quantum limited

529
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,720
performance and um some of these

530
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,360
amplifiers made using jce injunctions

531
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,360
through a collaboration with MIT linol

532
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,720
lab

533
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,960
these are say one of the standard

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,840
measure amplifiers for superc conducting

535
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,679
uh Cubit measurements the bandwidth and

536
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,039
dynamic range to simultaneously measure

537
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,440
tens of cubits and they have uh um and

538
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,520
hundreds of them have been um

539
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,320
distributed uh worldwide through these

540
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,039
this collaboration um here's an example

541
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,400
of the gain as a function of frequency

542
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:53,559
showing very Broadband uh

543
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,240
performance so if we look to the noise

544
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,919
performance uh I won't go into the

545
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,360
details of how this is measured but it

546
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,840
has about half the ideal noise

547
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,880
performance performance and it'd be

548
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,679
really great if these had uh the the

549
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,480
full the quantum limited noise

550
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,880
performance because that can lead to

551
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,760
obtaining all the information from the

552
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Cubit and faster measurements

553
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,200
so um if we we can break down the

554
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,320
quantum efficiency uh budget and we can

555
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,120
find that uh some of the quantum

556
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,480
efficiency is actually unaccounted for

557
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,320
and some is related to things like um

558
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,360
lossy dialectric which can be improved

559
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,320
with better uh fabrication and and

560
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,440
engineering um maybe quick question

561
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,000
since we started like roughly half an

562
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,600
hour late should we try to finish early

563
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,480
or is it okay

564
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,480
to okay great um okay

565
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,440
so so in terms of the quantum efficiency

566
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,360
um you can view the quantum efficiency

567
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,760
of these amplifiers in a in a perfect

568
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,640
single two mode amplifier you inject a

569
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,840
frequency called the signal this is

570
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,760
Amplified this generates an idler but in

571
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,559
a realistic amplifier you generate all

572
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,279
these other sidebands all these other

573
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:06,080
frequencies and they mix in noise

574
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:07,960
um and our idea is that we can build

575
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,279
something called a we call a Flo mode

576
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,200
amplifier where we can adiabatically

577
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,120
change the nonlinearity of the system so

578
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,799
we can make it like a spring that that

579
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,400
responds very uh strongly to the um to

580
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,840
the applied field on the two or very

581
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,799
weakly to the applied field on the two

582
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,039
sides or very strongly in the middle and

583
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,200
then if we adiabatically vary the

584
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,760
strength of the this nonlinearity then

585
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,799
we can um we can generate all these side

586
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,480
bands and then coherently recombine them

587
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:43,200
into the um into the

588
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,919
output and maybe another way to think

589
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,039
about this is that um if you look at the

590
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,960
Dynamics of this amplifier where you

591
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,840
inject the signal it creates the

592
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,520
Amplified signal in The Idler the the

593
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,679
blue and the orange line and then and

594
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,799
this is what you want but it also

595
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,600
generates all this other stuff but if

596
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,159
you go through and you look at this in a

597
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,919
different basis called the basis of

598
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,679
floquet modes then you find that it

599
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,360
looks really simple and you only have

600
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,640
these two modes that do anything useful

601
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,480
so our idea was that we can

602
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,919
adiabatically uh interact with these

603
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,159
modes and it turns out that this if you

604
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,880
do this then um you can eliminate the

605
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,919
contribution of all these um noise modes

606
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,559
at the

607
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,240
output

608
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,200
um and when we simulate the response of

609
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,880
this device we see that the um Quantum

610
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,120
efficiency is improved by the the can

611
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,679
call it quantum inefficiency it's

612
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,720
improved by orders of magnitude when we

613
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,960
implement this this flow case scheme and

614
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,360
there's no trade-off in in

615
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,400
bandwidth so one one thing that I'm uh

616
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,400
quite passionate about in the the field

617
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,200
of um of super conducting circuits and

618
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,440
Quantum information is um analysis and

619
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
modeling Ike was mentioning how you know

620
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,840
it's kind of a a a Triumph of of

621
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,600
engineering that um the blue origin

622
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,120
rocket launch it it worked on the first

623
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
time and I think that's really key for

624
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,039
uh Quantum engineering building the

625
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,400
types of uh analysis software and the

626
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:17,799
types of methodologies to make these

627
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,679
systems work um and one of the things

628
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,400
that we uh contributed to this was

629
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,360
building open source Eda tools for

630
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,320
nonlinear circuit simulation uh for

631
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,000
these Quantum devices particular we

632
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,799
built this uh software package called

633
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,360
Joseph and circuits that's an open

634
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:33,840
source harmonic balance Simulator for

635
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,640
parametric processes um and it's about

636
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,520
10,000 times faster than the uh software

637
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,120
that uh people the open source software

638
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,360
WR spice that people are typically using

639
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,679
and um we also collaborated with kyite

640
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,960
to compare this uh with their uh ads

641
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:53,440
software and also to um help uh improve

642
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,480
commercial software in this in this area

643
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,000
um so now we want to actually build

644
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,360
these things so we fabricate this using

645
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
this all aluminum uh Cubit process at

646
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,919
MIT Lincoln Laboratories and we build

647
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,320
the uh device using uh coper wave guide

648
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,440
capacitors to uh reach near zero

649
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,279
dissipation and here's an image of the

650
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,279
wafer of these devices it was fabricated

651
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:21,039
in the um in their Foundry and here we

652
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,039
can look at one of the examples of these

653
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,120
devices it's this Meandering chain of

654
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,120
devices of uh this Meandering

655
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
transmission line where you inject the

656
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,919
signal and the microwave pump on one

657
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,880
side and you get the Amplified signal on

658
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:36,559
the other side and this is in one of the

659
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,279
packages that we developed so if we look

660
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,039
at the performance of this we see that

661
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:44,399
it achieves over 20 DB gain with minimal

662
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,679
insertion loss and um when we measure

663
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,600
the noise performance we see that it

664
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,080
reaches about 85% of the uh relative to

665
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,000
the quantum limit for pH preserving

666
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,919
amplifiers so this is uh getting quite

667
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,960
close to uh to being a an ideal uh

668
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:03,600
amplifier which is is really exciting

669
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:08,200
um so a lot of the the stuff that we do

670
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,120
it also involves um seos style process

671
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,039
engineering where we actually build

672
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,399
these things in the clean room in mit.

673
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,000
Nano we we characterize tens of

674
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:18,919
thousands of these jce injunctions in

675
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,480
order to improve the reliability so that

676
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,679
we can build these um quantum computers

677
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,600
in a in a predictable

678
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,240
way maybe just in the interest of time

679
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,640
um I'll go quickly through the last uh

680
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,360
section I wanted to cover is can we make

681
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,000
Cubit readout uh 10 times

682
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,039
faster

683
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,399
so as we were talking about uh Cubit

684
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,000
readout earlier

685
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,720
um we readout a cubit by essentially

686
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,440
coupling it to a resonator sending

687
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,559
microwaves into this resonator and

688
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,120
determining the state of the Cubit well

689
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:53,679
uh

690
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,320
to to maximize the speed at which this

691
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,559
happens you want to have a resonance

692
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,399
with a very broad bandwidth and you also

693
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,760
have to have the shift that the cubic

694
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:05,399
creates comparable to that bandwidth and

695
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,279
that shift that the cubic creates this

696
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:08,600
is something called the dispersive shift

697
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,320
and this is limited by how much

698
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,520
nonlinearity you have and it it turns

699
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:17,679
out that that amount of nonlinearity is

700
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,360
limited our idea was to use um a type of

701
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,000
Cubit that has a rather than a quadratic

702
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,039
potential with a bit of uh cortic

703
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,880
potential to it we wanted to use a type

704
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,480
of Cubit called a Corton that has a

705
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,159
purely quartic potential and this is

706
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,720
really weird from a physics perspective

707
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,200
because most things in nature are

708
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,399
harmonic oscillators quadratic

709
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,559
potentials this is something that's that

710
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,279
has no harmonic component and it turns

711
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,240
out that electrically this behaves like

712
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,399
a infinite inductor and when you place

713
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,840
this in between two cubits you can

714
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,120
actually turn one of the cubits into a

715
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,519
resonator and achieve a very strong

716
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,640
nonlinear interaction between these two

717
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,679
and we were able to using the system

718
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,000
experimentally demonstrate the the

719
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:00,120
strongest um nonlinear light matter

720
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,679
coupling of any Quant coherent system um

721
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:06,159
in you know either superc connecting

722
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,880
cubits photonics Etc uh which um you

723
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,519
know potentially has applications as we

724
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,960
discussed in this paper um for improving

725
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,080
readout speed by about an order of

726
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,880
magnitude um simply because this

727
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,240
nonlinearity is very high so that leads

728
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,919
to really strong

729
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,399
interactions um so I think I'm going to

730
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,960
uh wrap up here acknowledge my group and

731
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:27,200
maybe if there's time I'd be happy to

732
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,250
take a couple questions uh thank you

733
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,740
everyone

734
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:34,740
[Applause]

735
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,760
did I thought I might have heard you say

736
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,720
something about being able to measure a

737
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,039
c a cubit more than just whether it's a

738
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,320
zero or one is that is that the

739
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:58,519
case

740
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,519
so you can

741
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,600
in the in the kind of textbook picture

742
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,519
of quantum mechanics you have this

743
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,679
so-called ideal projective measurement

744
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,600
where you have your your Cubit say in

745
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,720
some superposition State and then you

746
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,240
measure it and it and it you know you

747
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,720
get a zero or you get a one in real life

748
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,360
measurements take a finite amount of

749
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,840
time so that process can't happen

750
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,519
infinitely quickly so what really is

751
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,919
this uh slow measurement or this

752
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,159
measurement process that that's

753
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,640
continuous where you gradually extract

754
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,240
more information about the state of the

755
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,880
cubit and then the Cubit gradually

756
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,519
decays into one of its states so you can

757
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,039
actually look at these trajectories uh

758
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,919
of the of the of the Cubit resonator

759
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:43,159
system um so yeah it's it's more

760
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:45,760
complicated than the the the textbook

761
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,559
the that there's a time period where the

762
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,440
Cubit isn't a partially ingled State

763
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,799
measure oh absolutely yeah yeah yeah

764
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,120
yeah yeah you you start out with the

765
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:57,159
Cubit and the resonator fully entangled

766
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,799
and then you gradually uh you know

767
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:00,440
destroy that entangle going to decohere

768
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,480
the state of the the Cubit resonator

769
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,440
system and extract that useful

770
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,880
information and if you have a really

771
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,360
good amplifier then you can you know get

772
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,440
that information to to you if you have a

773
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,720
a bad amplifier then that information

774
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,600
may be lost to the environment well

775
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,559
going back

776
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:24,440
to security issues supposing Eve

777
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,519
comes process measuring your cubid what

778
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,600
happens that is an external second part

779
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,320
just try

780
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,720
the same time if a external party is

781
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,200
trying to measure your your Cubit then

782
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,399
that can

783
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,120
um I guess it depends that can cause

784
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,880
your Cubit to so normally if you if your

785
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,279
system is perfect and there are no EES

786
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,039
or no thermal photons in your

787
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,679
environment then your measurement rate

788
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,200
equals your def phasing rate um but if

789
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,000
there's an eve or if there are say

790
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,760
thermal photons then your your def

791
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,360
phasing rate can be faster so so it

792
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,679
would show up as an increase def phasing

793
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,919
rate

794
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,240
yeah can this partial measurement be

795
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,679
useful for

796
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,880
anything um it's useful for a lot of

797
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,320
um understanding the fundamentals of

798
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,559
quantum mechanics I don't know that it's

799
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,840
useful in the sense of like solving uh

800
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,600
quantum chemistry problems but maybe

801
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,840
that'd be a great question to ask in the

802
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,320
panel so I think um in a vacuum I'd love

803
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,880
to answer more questions but I think in

804
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,919
the interest of time probably we should

805
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,919
shift to the the panel
