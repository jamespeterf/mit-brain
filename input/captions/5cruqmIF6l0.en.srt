1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,199
All right. So today's topic is

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,800
stochcastic calculus.

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:24,960
And this uh topic is really an engaging

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,760
one in uh quantitative finance because

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,640
it extends

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,520
ordinary calculus with real variables to

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,320
calculus that depends upon stochastic

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,360
processes and in particular brownie and

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,760
motion processes. And so when we are

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,840
thinking about how to model the value of

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,039
a stock or of a derivative such as a

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:58,320
simple option or a more complex option,

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:02,640
um we can model the dynamics of these

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:07,360
assets or uh derivative contracts

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,520
as integrals of functions

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,520
with respect to Brownie and motion where

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,680
Brownie in motion characterizes the

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,560
underlying dynamics of the asset. And so

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,400
it's really neat to see how we can

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,040
develop stochastic calculus and relate

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
it to what's familiar to us with

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,840
ordinary real calculus, but see how

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,360
there are extensions of the uh formulas

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,560
that accommodate the randomness

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,520
in the uh increments with which we're uh

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,960
integrating. So let's consider uh just

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,320
reviewing first brownie in motion with

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,119
drift. Um we discussed this earlier in

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,640
our discussion of uh stochcastic

30
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,960
processes.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:06,159
And a standard brownie in motion model

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:08,479
is one where we have our process X

33
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,000
depending upon the underlying brownie in

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,680
motion standardized Brownian motion B of

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,360
T

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,680
with a drift parameter mu

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,480
and a volatility parameter sigma or

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,200
variance parameter sigma squared.

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,720
And the key property of brownie in

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,120
motion

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:37,200
is includes independent increments

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,000
and the variation of increments of the

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,640
process being proportional to the length

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,239
of the increment.

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:50,160
So with standard branding motion where

46
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:54,800
we have a drift parameter of zero and a

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:58,720
sigma volatility of one um the extension

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,879
of these properties to have essentially

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:08,319
mean zero and standard deviation equal

50
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,879
to sigma time t is to have the mean

51
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,640
depend upon time with the drift

52
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,040
parameter and the volatility uh or

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
variance to be proportional to sigma

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,200
squared times the length of the

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,000
interval.

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,360
Now in terms of understanding

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,239
Brownian motion um it's going to be

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,959
useful for us to focus on the

59
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,560
conditional distribution

60
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:43,080
of

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,080
the value at time t plus delta

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:53,760
as a function of

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:57,920
the value at time x of t.

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,280
And so when we think of a graph of

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,799
brownie motion which is some

66
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,120
path,

67
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:11,040
if we fix at a given value t

68
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,480
the value

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:20,040
of x of t

70
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,040
uh or maybe I should write this as s

71
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:31,759
the value of x at time little t. Then if

72
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,160
we know the value at time little t, what

73
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,840
is the distribution the conditional

74
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:42,960
distribution into the future? Well, this

75
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:47,280
increment uh t plus delta t. Delta t in

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,880
red, we can just expand that out to mu t

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,759
plus delta t plus sigma b of t plus

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:00,400
deltat t. And then we can group

79
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:03,759
the known terms on the left hand side of

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,880
the or the left hand terms of the second

81
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:13,199
equation u t plus sigma b of t. Then we

82
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,960
have a term mu delta t which is a

83
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,560
constant not random. But then we have

84
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:26,720
the increment of the Brownian motion

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:29,919
process from time t to time uh delta t t

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,880
plus delta t. So actually there's a typo

87
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,600
here. That should be b of t plus delta t

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,560
minus b of t.

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,080
And so uh we have that our delta x

90
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,680
increment

91
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:50,560
is mu delta t plus sigma delta b of t.

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:54,400
Now this increment has mean mu delta t

93
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,280
variance sigma squar delta t. And for

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
brownie in motion with drift,

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,440
this

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,000
increment is exactly distributed as a

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,639
normal random variable with that mean

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,240
and variance.

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:15,199
And what's useful to uh think about is

100
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,000
what happens as the increment

101
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:24,960
deltat t gets infinitesismal.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,639
And so if we look at the infiniteesimal

103
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,840
increment

104
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:37,120
for delta t, then the expected squared

105
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:42,080
value of the brownian motion increment

106
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,400
is equal to sigma^ 2 delta t plus mu

107
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,360
delta t ^ 2. This is actually an exact

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,120
formula. And but what's important for us

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,880
is that as delta t goes to zero as it

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,759
becomes infinite tesimal then

111
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,720
this squared

112
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,720
increment has expectation that's of

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,520
order deltat t and it actually equals

114
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,840
sigma square delta t plus little o of

115
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:15,120
delta t. So this little O notation means

116
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,280
that as delta t goes to zero this

117
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,599
remainder part goes to zero as well. And

118
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,479
if we consider

119
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:30,720
powers of our increment of delta x

120
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:34,800
where the power c is greater than two

121
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,919
then this will also be small o of delta

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:45,120
t. So expressions that depend upon

123
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:48,639
second or higher order uh will of delta

124
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,360
x will actually be u comparable to sigma

125
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,360
squar delta t.

126
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,199
So in with brownie in motion and drift

127
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,479
um

128
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,720
we have the notation for a stochcastic

129
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,199
differential equation

130
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,400
which is simply the increment of x is

131
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:15,680
equal to

132
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,919
mu deltat t or dt rather plus sigma db

133
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,919
of t.

134
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,319
And with this notation um

135
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:33,360
the uh solution

136
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:36,159
turns out to be x of t is equal to the

137
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,640
value of x at time z plus the integral

138
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:46,279
from 0 to t mu dt plus the integral from

139
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,279
0 to t of sigma dbs.

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,920
And um

141
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,839
this solution sort of seems obvious

142
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
when we think about what how we

143
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:03,440
understand sort of differential

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,680
equations or with real functions but it

145
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,519
does extend to this solution when we

146
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:16,560
have brownie in motion. And so as noted

147
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:24,560
there this is equal to x kn + uh t - 0 *

148
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:30,399
mu plus sigma * b of t minus b of 0.

149
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:33,760
So our sort of integration of functions

150
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,839
of brownie and motion sort of have this

151
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,440
nominal solution which seems very

152
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:44,480
reasonable and will in fact show that

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:48,880
this solution is useful and it actually

154
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:53,279
extends to uh more complex

155
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,640
equations. Now the more complex

156
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,480
differential equations are one where we

157
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,040
consider a drift term mu that's not a

158
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,080
constant. It may vary over time and it

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,519
may also vary depending upon the

160
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:15,360
magnitude of the process.

161
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,519
So this kind of an extension is quite

162
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
general

163
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,399
and we can think about the same

164
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,240
extension to the volatility

165
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,480
rather than being a constant. It might

166
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,920
vary with t and it might vary with xt.

167
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,000
And with derivative

168
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:40,880
contracts,

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:44,560
um, we have values of contracts

170
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:49,120
which at any given time

171
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,720
depend on time, maybe time to maturity

172
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,920
and the level of the process.

173
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,839
And apart from those two sort of

174
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:04,240
features or properties of the derivative

175
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:07,519
at time little t we have a valuation

176
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,480
model that applies according to some

177
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,680
function. So it'll be very useful to

178
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,120
have these generalized drift and

179
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,079
generalized volatility parameters. Yes.

180
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,720
>> How is the um second like defined

181
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,519
because like obviously the first like

182
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
the better reman integral. What about

183
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,079
the second one? Like is there like an

184
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
actual formal definition of I guess it's

185
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,079
integral,

186
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,760
>> right? And and we will get there uh in a

187
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,560
moment, but you know if we're

188
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,079
integrating from

189
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,760
well here it's from zero to t. Um if

190
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,000
we're integrating the process over

191
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,959
increments, we're basically going to be

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,600
summing over the increments. although

193
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,160
summing on the infinite decimal time

194
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,040
scale over the entire period between

195
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,519
zero and t. And so if we break that sum

196
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,760
of infiniteesimal increments, we

197
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,000
basically get the last value minus the

198
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:13,200
first. And so we we'll see that come

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,800
into play. So um what we will determine

200
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,959
with this general setup though is that

201
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,600
when we have extended drift and

202
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,120
volatility, we then will have a solution

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,200
to this uh brownie in motion with drift

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,720
with sort of generalized drift and

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,519
volatility

206
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,320
satisfying this equation. So, we're

207
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,839
going to want to be able to compute

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
these

209
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,399
integrals

210
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,120
in a consistent way and the eto calculus

211
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:47,040
provides us with that. So, we have to

212
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,959
define eto integrals.

213
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,639
Well,

214
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,760
in defining eto integrals,

215
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,320
um we have this notation that we need to

216
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,760
be comfortable with. Um we are going to

217
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,360
first of all consider a

218
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
probability

219
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,920
process

220
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,040
that

221
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,959
is defined by this triple.

222
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:21,880
Now let's see have anyone people here uh

223
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,880
taken sort of advanced probability

224
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,399
or measure theory? Um

225
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,880
well we basically have here sort of a

226
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,760
sample space

227
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,839
and here we have what's called a sigma

228
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,800
field

229
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:45,040
of sets

230
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:49,560
which are subset of omega. And then here

231
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,560
we have a probability model

232
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,000
where if we have

233
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:00,320
a a subset of omega

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,279
and it's an element of this sigma field

235
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,800
we have this probability of that set

236
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,800
is well defined.

237
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,360
So

238
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,120
this notation sort of encompasses the

239
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,160
generality of probability models that

240
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,600
are important to

241
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:31,320
uh specify and be comfortable with.

242
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,320
Well, with the omega set here, um

243
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:41,959
these are a collection of little omegas

244
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,959
which are possible sample paths

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,160
of this

246
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,560
uh brownie in motion.

247
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,800
And

248
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:00,240
we can think of

249
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:03,600
okay here's one path one possible path.

250
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,600
Um another possible path

251
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,519
actually matches

252
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,279
the first path up to time t but then

253
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,399
continues on somewhere else.

254
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,880
Another path

255
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,959
could be one that is sort of reflected

256
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,279
about a given level. We went through

257
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,360
this a bit in our discussion of brownie

258
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,839
emotion processes.

259
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,440
And so we can think of just the

260
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:37,040
collection of all possible paths. Now

261
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,760
the filtration ft

262
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,079
um we think of

263
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,360
script ft.

264
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,560
This is going to be the sigma field

265
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,079
of events

266
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,959
um

267
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,680
or paths

268
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:59,000
which are fixed

269
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,000
or known

270
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,720
uh at times

271
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,279
s less than or equal to t.

272
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,920
So

273
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,120
with script ft the information up to

274
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:20,399
time t if

275
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,000
sort of this is our path up to time t.

276
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,120
Um

277
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,639
the event of

278
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,680
following this path up to time t sort of

279
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,240
is deterministic.

280
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,320
If we look back

281
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:42,000
deterministic

282
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:46,480
for s less than t but then it's random

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,160
random for s greater than t.

284
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,519
So we have a

285
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,600
uh a value or in script ft. It basically

286
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:01,040
says okay we can work with

287
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:05,760
paths that are deterministic before time

288
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,559
t but then are random after time t. And

289
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,439
so that's

290
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,120
relates to the uh concept of being

291
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,319
measurable.

292
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,360
So we say that um events in ft are

293
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:23,439
measurable with respect to bs with the

294
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:28,640
information set up to time t. So if we

295
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:33,039
consider times before t um the path is

296
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,919
actually just a constant uh or as a as a

297
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:41,760
function a path valued function that

298
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:45,200
that's constant. Now um if we uh have

299
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,320
this probability measure on omega the

300
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,400
space of all possible paths

301
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,200
um if we consider the sort of

302
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,440
conditional distribution

303
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,600
given

304
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:04,720
x at time t. Then we're trying to

305
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:09,840
specify the model for all future paths

306
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,760
that start at the level x at time t. And

307
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,840
um

308
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:19,679
the uh sort of that probability measure

309
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,280
over the entire space of

310
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,799
paths

311
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:29,440
um can also be restricted to the paths

312
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:32,720
up to time little t. So we can um

313
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:37,600
basically uh focus on probability

314
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:41,200
measures that are unconditional but

315
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:47,039
restricted to the information set up to

316
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:51,039
time t. Now we'll want to refer to the

317
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:55,120
value of the bronian motion at time t.

318
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:59,120
And it's important to

319
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:03,760
know that often this notation BT is

320
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:07,200
implicitly the value of a specific path.

321
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,760
So to emphasize that we'll indicate that

322
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,039
it's uh the Brownian motion path indexed

323
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,360
by little omega.

324
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,840
And so

325
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,240
we then want to consider the eto

326
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,799
integrals with respect to brownie and

327
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,039
motion first where we consider simple

328
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,080
functions,

329
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:38,640
real functions

330
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,240
where f of bs is the value of little f

331
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,520
evaluated

332
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,679
at the position value of the brownie in

333
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,679
motion.

334
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,160
and we'll want to consider integrating

335
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,120
that function

336
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,679
from 0 to t.

337
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:02,960
Um, and so uh this is this is our

338
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,360
notation. So

339
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,840
with a uh

340
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,840
sort of companion

341
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:20,880
uh graph with the same x axis as our

342
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:24,280
brownie in motion. We could have f being

343
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,280
some function

344
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,280
which um varies and we want to basically

345
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,520
integrate

346
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:41,080
this function f evaluated at the brownie

347
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,080
in motion. So actually this is uh

348
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,159
this is actually a wrong graph. I

349
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,640
thought we had had the same same graph.

350
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:55,360
We basically want um for

351
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,480
sort of let's say x= bs

352
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,960
um of omega

353
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,960
um some function.

354
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
All right.

355
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,039
Well,

356
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,640
if we

357
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:14,880
consider this notation to represent our

358
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:19,440
eto integral, we're going to develop the

359
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,039
formulas for these eto integrals.

360
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,960
And

361
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,159
importantly,

362
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,960
this eto integral

363
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,520
is going to

364
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,840
have

365
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:41,840
basically a sort of deterministic simple

366
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:43,919
real integration term for each path.

367
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,679
But

368
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:50,400
the paths indexed by omega are random.

369
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,360
And so this eto integral is actually

370
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,000
going to be a random variable. And as a

371
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:01,480
random variable, if it exists, it'll

372
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,480
have an expectation and a variance.

373
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:10,159
So let's consider a number of special

374
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:12,400
cases that will define eto integrals.

375
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay, the first

376
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,000
case is the simple one where f ofx is

377
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
equal to 1.

378
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,960
So

379
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,159
let me just erase this

380
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:32,880
and have the level one.

381
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:34,960
So we consider f ofx equaling one.

382
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,679
So if we

383
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,000
integrate the increments of brownie

384
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,840
motion over

385
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,200
from zero to capital t.

386
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:53,280
uh let's propose that that's equal to

387
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:58,799
the increment from zero to

388
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:01,039
uh from zero to t for each path. So the

389
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,480
right hand side

390
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,320
corresponds to the sort of simple

391
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,799
integral

392
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,360
of this

393
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:19,039
path BS of omega between

394
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:22,799
BT between time zero and capital T.

395
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,600
And um

396
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:31,120
I guess it's not in the notes, but if we

397
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,440
were to consider the integral of 0 to t

398
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,720
db s

399
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:43,120
of omega.

400
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:50,640
Um, we could think of this as the uh

401
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:52,720
sum from zero to n of uh i

402
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,200
t

403
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,200
over n

404
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,039
let's see

405
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:11,600
let me do this i = 1 to n i -1 t

406
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,120
over n the integral from i - 1 t / n to

407
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,600
i

408
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,600
* t over over n

409
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
dbs.

410
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:29,120
So here I'm thinking of busy dividing

411
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,760
this increment from zero to t into

412
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:37,760
different increments

413
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:41,120
of width capital t over n. And

414
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,480
if we approximate

415
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,320
or each of these integrals here are

416
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:54,400
basically looking at the integral of uh

417
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:59,039
or the change in b s from these lower

418
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:04,080
limits to the upper limits. And so

419
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:07,200
the integral of dbs of omega you know in

420
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,360
a consistent way or well- definfined way

421
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,360
is defined by this increment of the

422
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,480
whole process. Now if that's true then

423
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,320
the when we consider the randomness in

424
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,240
omega

425
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:26,400
the expectation of this integral is zero

426
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,200
where b is the standard brownie motion

427
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,080
and this variance is equal to the length

428
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,919
of the interval times the sigma of

429
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,520
standard brownie motion.

430
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:43,360
Well,

431
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:47,039
if we change our function f to be not

432
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,760
the constant one over the whole real

433
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:56,240
line, but just the indicator of an

434
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:59,679
interval, it's just one between a and b.

435
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:03,760
So, we have a and b here. And we have

436
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,640
basically zero up to a and then it

437
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:12,159
equals

438
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,840
one up to B and then it's zero beyond.

439
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:18,000
Um

440
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:21,200
then this eto integral

441
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,760
is essentially looking at the change in

442
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,640
brownian motion from time a to time b.

443
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,440
So

444
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,120
no surprise that that's a reasonable

445
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,640
definition.

446
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,640
Now from these reasonable definitions

447
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,640
we can consider

448
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:48,880
a second case where our function f

449
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:55,200
is again a function only of time

450
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:58,640
s but it's given by a step function over

451
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,960
time with steps

452
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:06,400
or levels given by the ais that are

453
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:11,600
constant. So we go from this single step

454
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:13,120
function here to considering

455
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,640
um

456
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,640
basically different step functions

457
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:26,960
for our function f. Now

458
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,760
these step functions could correspond to

459
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,000
like the number of shares held of an

460
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:37,679
asset. And so, you know, this integral

461
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,640
could correspond to the gain or loss um

462
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,799
if the underlying asset sort of followed

463
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,600
brownie in motion. Um but here with this

464
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:51,200
particular step function,

465
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,200
we can define the eto integral to just

466
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,480
be the sum

467
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,520
over the increments of the step levels

468
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,799
times the increment of the process. And

469
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,440
so, you know, that's a pretty sensible

470
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,240
uh definition of the integral and it

471
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,600
would apply um if we had assets

472
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,960
traveling uh values going by a brownie

473
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:19,120
in motion process and say shares given

474
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,520
by uh the a constants that were maybe uh

475
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,440
deterine deterministic.

476
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:29,600
Now at this point we're using functions

477
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,679
f which are deterministic functions of

478
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,799
time.

479
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:41,200
We can then extend

480
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:43,360
this to uh sort of random functions. And

481
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,039
actually before I do so just notice in

482
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,960
red the mean zero and the variance of

483
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,440
this

484
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:57,440
eto integral of the uh step function.

485
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,080
The variance is simply the sum of the

486
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,240
squares of the

487
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:08,159
levels times the length of the increment

488
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,279
over which that level applies.

489
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,679
So now case three things get more

490
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:19,840
interesting. We can allow our levels

491
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:25,440
AI to be random variables

492
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:28,159
and these variables random variables AI.

493
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,120
Um

494
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,200
so AI equal to AI of omega.

495
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,760
This is

496
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:45,279
a path and so we can have the levels

497
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,279
vary depending upon what the path value

498
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,200
is.

499
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,039
And so

500
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,760
we want the AI

501
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,760
to depend

502
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,760
on

503
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,000
uh

504
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,000
and I guess by depend I'll say be

505
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
deterministic

506
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:20,080
on script ft subi.

507
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:23,760
So if we define our levels to

508
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:28,080
be functions that are in this are

509
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,720
measurable in this information set then

510
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,679
um that's what we're doing here. Now

511
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,679
earlier uh we talked about

512
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,679
nonanticipatory

513
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,799
variables

514
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,880
and so this is a non-anticipatory

515
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,559
variable. It basically says that the

516
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:50,080
level from TI on

517
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,720
for whatever that increment is is going

518
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,880
to be a function of what's happened in

519
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:03,120
the past. So this is like a realizable

520
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:07,200
uh function f where when we apply the f

521
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,360
function to the uh brownie motion

522
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,679
increments we're applying known

523
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:18,080
increments at all times.

524
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:22,559
And so with this case, we actually want

525
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:27,679
to make an assumption of measurability

526
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:31,840
on that I uh information set and we want

527
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:35,600
a bounded squared expectation of the

528
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:39,519
level. So if we have those two

529
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,120
properties then we can write out the eto

530
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,120
integral

531
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:48,480
as this formula and it will have

532
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,399
expectation equal to zero and variance

533
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,240
equal to

534
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:59,120
the sum of the expected squared ais

535
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,799
times ti uh + 1 minus ti.

536
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,279
Okay.

537
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,000
So, um

538
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:10,080
I guess rather importantly

539
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,919
with um these developments so far, we're

540
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,559
thinking of

541
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,200
the time S ranging from zero up to time

542
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,799
capital T.

543
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,120
And we have increments ti

544
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:29,200
+ one

545
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,640
where this increment

546
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,960
is something. Um for simplicity we could

547
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,559
define this increment to have length say

548
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,240
t over n for n increments and have equal

549
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,240
increments.

550
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,360
Um

551
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:52,919
but this uh this formula for the eto

552
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,919
integral is considering integrating

553
00:32:53,039 --> 00:33:00,679
the brownian motion over the interval

554
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,679
from 0 to t. So

555
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,679
so integral from 0 to t f of s bs dbs.

556
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,200
This is our integral our eto process I

557
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,480
of f

558
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:24,000
and um we can write

559
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,960
I of f

560
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,600
evaluated at a particular path given by

561
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,600
this formula.

562
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:40,000
All right. Um well an interesting

563
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:46,159
example just from a mathematician's

564
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:49,760
standpoint is what if we define our

565
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,320
levels to be equal to the value of the

566
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,799
brownian motion itself.

567
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,799
So we're integrating

568
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,000
B dB.

569
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,399
So we're thinking of this example. So

570
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,399
case three

571
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:16,760
special case three um integral from 0 to

572
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,760
t of b subs dbs.

573
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,560
Well,

574
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,159
if we consider sort of discretizing

575
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,159
this eto integral

576
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,159
um

577
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:39,520
with these random levels ai

578
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,639
um actually I'm getting ahead of myself.

579
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,159
This integral will be a limit of these

580
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,560
um

581
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:53,040
for any fixed set of increments

582
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:56,240
that we apply this

583
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,000
random level uh

584
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,760
given by the value of the brownie in

585
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,800
motion on those increments. Then for

586
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,880
each of these cases with n increments we

587
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:15,359
get that we have mean zero and the

588
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,400
variance is equal to the sum of the

589
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,400
variances of each of the terms. And that

590
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,640
turns out to be equal to the sum over

591
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:28,640
the increments of the time increment t

592
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,160
level uh ti times the increment to the

593
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,880
next

594
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:41,520
uh time value. And this sum of ti ti *

595
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:44,720
ti + 1 - ti is essentially

596
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:50,000
equal or close to the integral from zero

597
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:54,720
to capital t of s dds

598
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,280
which should be a half t ^2. Yeah.

599
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,520
>> Um how do you conclude that the

600
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,680
expectation is zero?

601
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,760
>> Okay. The expectation is uh zero

602
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,200
because

603
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,200
each of these increments here

604
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,320
have expectation zero. So we're assuming

605
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,000
B of zero is zero.

606
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:21,359
>> Yeah. But what if Oh yeah, but what if

607
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,280
AI is not independent? Like when you

608
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,800
take the expectations,

609
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,440
>> okay,

610
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,440
>> okay. Yep. Yep.

611
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,880
Let's see. Okay. Ai of omega is an

612
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:42,800
element of f subti.

613
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:45,040
So um it's uh

614
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,800
it's uh

615
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,599
constant

616
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:55,400
on uh f subti.

617
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,400
So um

618
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,000
let's see

619
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,920
so a i of omega

620
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,920
um

621
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,560
and b

622
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,560
t i + 1.

623
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,079
uh

624
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,079
this increment

625
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,680
into the future from time ti is

626
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:35,359
independent of the pa of the past

627
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:40,000
and so it's expectation

628
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:43,480
if we take the product of these two and

629
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,480
take expectations

630
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,079
um

631
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,079
we can take

632
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,800
the expectation

633
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,800
sort of um

634
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,480
given

635
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,480
uh or the expectation over TI times the

636
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,240
expectation

637
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,560
um sort of given

638
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,560
let's see

639
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,880
over TI + one given TI.

640
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,480
So we can break down this expectation

641
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,960
into

642
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,400
its decomposition and the expectation of

643
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,760
this factor conditionally will be zero.

644
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,359
>> Yeah, that makes sense.

645
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,079
>> So

646
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,400
yep.

647
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,040
All right. Um

648
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,440
well uh

649
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:42,480
this case four

650
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,839
is the case that essentially defines uh

651
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,560
EDO integrals in general which is if we

652
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,280
consider

653
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,200
taking the limit

654
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,160
of

655
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,680
integrals with respect to sort of step

656
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:04,320
functions with random levels AI.

657
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,200
But then allow the increments the time

658
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,880
steps to get closer and closer to each

659
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,240
other.

660
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:18,480
Then uh the limiting value of this

661
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:22,320
uh eto integral of the step functions is

662
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,320
equal to the eto integral of f.

663
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,760
So

664
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,839
we have um the uh in our special case

665
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,400
where f

666
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:40,079
ofx equals x um f of the brownian motion

667
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,880
is uh the brownian motion itself. we end

668
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:48,320
up getting this formula

669
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:52,240
and here we have basically the sort of

670
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,880
discretized value of the integral

671
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:59,359
and then what's of interest is to see

672
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,200
how the limit of that equals this

673
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,079
formula.

674
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,320
And so to prove this

675
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,839
there's a nice mathematical trick. Um

676
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,359
and so if we look at

677
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,800
this

678
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,160
term on the right hand side here which

679
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,720
is an element of the sum it turns out to

680
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,200
be equal to a half the difference in the

681
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,480
squared values at the end points of the

682
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,720
interval minus a half times the

683
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:36,000
difference

684
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:40,240
between ti and ti + 1 squared. So this

685
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,040
is simple to verify. It's trivial but

686
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,680
incredibly useful.

687
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:52,720
And so if we sum over all the time

688
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:56,880
points from 0 to n minus one, we get

689
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:01,680
the sum of the first terms

690
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:06,880
minus the sum of the second terms.

691
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:11,200
And so this first term

692
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,319
is actually a telescoping sum.

693
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,480
When you sum the terms, there's

694
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,400
cancellation

695
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:25,839
of a of the middle value in successive

696
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,319
terms. And so we're left at the end with

697
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,960
the

698
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:35,359
12 the square of the last term here

699
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,119
minus the square of the very first term

700
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,720
with i=

701
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:44,640
0 here which is zero. So this is a half

702
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:48,319
bt ^2 minus b 0^ 2 which is zero. That's

703
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,400
the first term. And then for the other

704
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:54,640
we have minus a half the sum of the

705
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,720
squared increments.

706
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,640
And so

707
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,200
if we

708
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:08,000
know sort of what the last

709
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:12,160
uh time interval term is tn that's

710
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:16,480
capital t. And then we have the same

711
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,240
terms on the right. And what's important

712
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,480
to know

713
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,960
is that the limit of the sums of these

714
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:30,160
increments

715
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:33,760
converges to t capital t and this was um

716
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,640
the property of the total variation of

717
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,079
brownie in motion over any increment. If

718
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,920
we look at the sum of squared values

719
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,000
of increments and take the limit as the

720
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,839
number of increments grows large and the

721
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,280
sort of partition gets um

722
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:56,240
uh finer and finer then the limiting

723
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,599
value of these sums of increments u is

724
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,280
equal to capital t. So this is our

725
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:08,000
formula now for the eto

726
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,640
integral of b dbs

727
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,319
and um

728
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,960
let's see so so what's really important

729
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,119
to highlight

730
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,359
is that

731
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,400
this is not equivalent to thinking of

732
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,319
the brownie in motion process like a

733
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,400
real function.

734
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,599
where we're integrating B dB or X dx

735
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,319
which is x^2 / 2

736
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,720
we actually have this drag on the

737
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,920
integral that's depends on the variation

738
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,280
of the process.

739
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,240
Okay. Now we want to generalize

740
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,599
um to the uh

741
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:58,800
general case of eto integrals.

742
00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:01,800
And so what we do is

743
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,800
we

744
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:11,440
consider defining the eto integrals

745
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:14,440
from 0 to t f of omega s

746
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,440
dbs.

747
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,680
But then um

748
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,400
we want to

749
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,000
basically consider this to be a process

750
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,319
XT

751
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,319
of omega.

752
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:38,319
And we want to generalize this

753
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:42,280
to an xt of omega where we're

754
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,280
integrating just

755
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:49,280
up to time little t.

756
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:53,640
So

757
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,640
what we want to do is

758
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:01,599
once we have this definition for the eto

759
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:07,000
integral

760
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,000
over a fixed interval from 0 to t.

761
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:20,000
We want to be able to define

762
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,760
the eto integral where we're integrating

763
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,560
only up to time little t less than uh

764
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:31,119
capital t. And so um

765
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,960
in order for this

766
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,880
um

767
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:40,480
kind of uh function to be uh to be well

768
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,920
defined

769
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,839
it will turn out that we need some very

770
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:51,680
strong mathematical arguments and

771
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:54,800
there's a book by steel chapter six on

772
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:59,200
uh sort of quantitative finance where he

773
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,359
does go into all the details and I have

774
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,119
to admit it's not really a fun read.

775
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,280
It's sort of interesting to look and see

776
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,280
what's involved. So you know how

777
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,880
important it is to sort of be a good

778
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,599
mathematician if you want to prove

779
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,880
things. But fortunate for us they are

780
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,440
proven well and we can apply them. So

781
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,599
what do we need? We need that the uh

782
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,000
function little f needs to be

783
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,319
measurable.

784
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,160
Script fs, the information set up to

785
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:32,160
time s measurable for every time s.

786
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:36,800
And we want the

787
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,839
integral of the squared f

788
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,280
over time

789
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:46,079
where that's for each fixed omega. We

790
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:50,000
can integrate the square of f and then

791
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:53,760
take the expectation of that. We want

792
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,359
that to be finite.

793
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,040
So

794
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:00,800
this

795
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:04,079
term this term here this expectation is

796
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:08,560
taking the expectation over the

797
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:12,640
probability model given by capital p.

798
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:16,960
Um, and we're for each omega we're

799
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,119
integrating the squared f over time from

800
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,880
0 to t

801
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:29,440
and we want that to be finite.

802
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:32,240
So um with this notation

803
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,839
we basically are extending

804
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,440
our

805
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:42,880
eto integral over 0 to capital t with

806
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:48,560
the eo integral from zero to little t.

807
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:53,760
And um we can define this by just

808
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:55,839
replacing our f function in the

809
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,800
eto integral

810
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:07,359
i of f by simply the function f times

811
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:10,800
this indicator from zero to t. So that

812
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:13,520
step basically chops off the integration

813
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:19,760
at time little t

814
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:23,040
and gives us our definition. Now um

815
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,920
let's see okay the uh the definition of

816
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,760
this extension

817
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,359
of

818
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,640
our eto integral over z to t to

819
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:38,720
integrating it over zero to uh little

820
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,880
t's for any little t less than t. Um

821
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,319
that's relatively

822
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:47,040
straightforward and intuitively obvious.

823
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:50,400
What's not necessarily obvious though is

824
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,400
that our process

825
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,400
XT

826
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,839
is a martingale

827
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,400
with respect to this stochcastic process

828
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:10,319
model given by the Brownian motions. So

829
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:13,359
um if we look at what it means for

830
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,920
a process to be a martingale, if we look

831
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:19,280
at the conditional expectation

832
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,480
of the time t + k

833
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,480
value given time t,

834
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,720
then

835
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:31,520
it equals the value of the process at

836
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:33,599
time t, little t, plus

837
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,720
the integral of the process process from

838
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,640
time t to t + k

839
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,119
and we're taking expectations

840
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,119
conditional expectations of that given

841
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:49,040
xt.

842
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:52,720
And so the expectation of this future

843
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,119
sort of increment from t to t plus k is

844
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,359
basically integrating a function times

845
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:00,240
increments of the brownie emotion where

846
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:05,040
our function values depend on the past

847
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:07,920
and the increments are independent in in

848
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,880
the future with mean zero. So this

849
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,559
expectation turns out to be satisfied.

850
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,040
And if we look at the conditional

851
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:22,079
variance of the t plus k value given xt

852
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:24,319
then it's equal to the expected square

853
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,760
of this

854
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:31,680
uh f ds.

855
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:34,880
And so when you look at the variance of

856
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,240
the discretized sum of increments,

857
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:42,720
you get the discretized sum of variances

858
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:46,559
of those increments which are f2 and

859
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,640
then the dbs squared

860
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,079
are ddt.

861
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,400
So this simplifies uh for the variance

862
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,319
to that term.

863
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,480
And

864
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:02,400
okay, all of this is fairly uh

865
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,800
I know it's like mathematical results

866
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:11,839
and it's sort of like who cares. Um

867
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:15,280
well it turns out that um this

868
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:19,040
um variance

869
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:23,280
turns out to be a squared norm

870
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:27,599
of our function little f

871
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,680
on the space of the probability

872
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,599
space of paths cross the time

873
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:36,240
increments.

874
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:38,319
And so what's

875
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,000
well, okay, actually I'm going to get

876
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:46,160
ahead of myself. Uh but let me let me

877
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,319
get to the let me get ahead of myself

878
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,240
and

879
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:52,480
basically

880
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,280
comment that

881
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,280
this norm

882
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:02,640
of our function f

883
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:07,680
is going to be a squared norm on the

884
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:09,359
space of etorocess integrants

885
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,200
And

886
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:17,440
let's see those of you who have taken uh

887
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:20,160
I guess real analysis or metric spaces

888
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,160
you know what's what's an important

889
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,319
value of

890
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:28,440
norms

891
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,440
what what do we do with norms

892
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,280
or squared norms?

893
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,680
Well, with norms, we can talk about

894
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,119
limits

895
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:47,920
of elements of the space

896
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:51,839
and talk about whether limits exist.

897
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,359
And so with this setup we actually will

898
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,720
have

899
00:52:53,359 --> 00:53:01,520
the space of eto processes

900
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:07,280
and we can calculate the squared norm

901
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:12,400
between different eto integrals.

902
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:15,599
And so we can characterize uh limits in

903
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,640
those spaces and be guaranteed that

904
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,240
those limits exist.

905
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,839
So

906
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:27,520
with this sort of motivation of defining

907
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:31,280
useful norms on different spaces, um we

908
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:35,280
have this eto isometry

909
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,640
which is if we look at the

910
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:44,079
variance of eto

911
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:46,160
integrals defined by integrant little f.

912
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:49,440
Then those

913
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:53,520
squared norms or the variances basically

914
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:59,079
of the eto processes is equal to the L2

915
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,079
norm of the integrant little f.

916
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,200
And

917
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:09,520
if we write out the definitions of these

918
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,280
sort of squared norms uh we get these

919
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:17,760
equations.

920
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:22,480
And what's um relevant here is

921
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:26,800
um being able to express

922
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:33,640
our variance of the eto integral as the

923
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:33,640
squared norm of the integrant f.

924
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,960
So we have limits and convergences of

925
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,800
sequences of eto integrals.

926
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,240
And

927
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,480
something that's important

928
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:49,440
mathematically is if we take the limits

929
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:51,920
of these eto uh integrals

930
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,520
over increments that are getting f a

931
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,960
grid of increments that's getting finer

932
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,400
and finer. Do we have a unique limit or

933
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,359
not?

934
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:05,680
And so that's what's

935
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:08,960
important and is um the squared norms

936
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,319
and convergence are uh properties are

937
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:17,040
used to prove that. So we basically can

938
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:23,839
talk about closed linear subspaces

939
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:28,160
with these uh norms on on the space.

940
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:30,640
So what this does is it allows us to

941
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,400
define sort of the distance between

942
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:37,680
different integrants f

943
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:44,720
and um

944
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:49,040
the the uh existence of a limiting uh in

945
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:53,760
uh eto integral um as we consider

946
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:57,280
increments getting uh infinite. Tesmal.

947
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:01,760
All right. Um well,

948
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:05,839
we can think of this eto integral as a

949
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:08,160
remon sum, a limiting remon sum.

950
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:11,680
And

951
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:16,640
if we have time

952
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:22,640
steps ti for simplicity equal to it t /n

953
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:24,960
um we can consider the limiting sum

954
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,799
of f of

955
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,040
the brownian motion times the increment

956
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,720
of the brownian motion.

957
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,480
And

958
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:37,200
this

959
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:39,920
sum actually converges in probability um

960
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,480
as n goes to infinity

961
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,559
um to the integral. So um so we have a

962
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,079
limiting

963
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:56,640
value that uh exists convergence and

964
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:58,880
probability and um if we consider uh I

965
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,480
guess the co-variances

966
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,839
of

967
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,680
the x process given by these eto

968
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:10,720
integrals

969
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:14,559
from zero to little t. Um then

970
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:17,200
these will or this XT will be a mean

971
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:21,599
zero Gaussian process with independent

972
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:25,040
increments and the co-variance between

973
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:29,599
the process at time s and time t will

974
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:34,640
simply be equal to the integral of the

975
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:37,200
squared f over the times where they both

976
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:40,400
are non zero.

977
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,880
So um

978
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,839
all right so we take a partition from 0

979
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,720
to t we get this result

980
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:54,000
um and we can prove that the limit

981
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:55,760
equals the uh this integral notation. So

982
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,799
basically there's a limit that exists

983
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,920
and this is a notation for that limit.

984
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:04,319
Um and steel goes into a lot of the

985
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,119
details for that.

986
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,119
Now um

987
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:17,599
now what's of interest is that we can

988
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:20,480
now consider sort of some general eto uh

989
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,119
cases which will be referred to as eto's

990
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:27,599
formula for different kinds of function

991
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:32,640
fs functions f and so if we consider

992
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:34,240
first the case where f little f is a a

993
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,480
real function

994
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:41,119
mapping reals to real. Then

995
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,359
if it has a continuous

996
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:49,680
uh second derivative

997
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:54,000
then we can express the function f of bt

998
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,839
in terms of its sort of tailor uh

999
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,599
approximation

1000
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:05,440
um and we get this formula which is

1001
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:08,079
eto's formula for f of bt and uh in

1002
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:11,920
looking at this expression

1003
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:16,880
what's relevant is that okay the first

1004
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:20,960
term f0 is a constant the second term

1005
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,440
is a Gaussian sort of process integral

1006
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:27,920
is an integral of brownian motion and

1007
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:30,480
then the third term is the integral of

1008
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:36,160
the second derivative of f with

1009
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:39,440
evaluated at the uh bs value and So we

1010
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:44,720
have an adaptive sort of drift term

1011
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:47,200
and we can prove this formula or outline

1012
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:51,280
the proof by saying okay let's consider

1013
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:55,280
the tailor approximation of f at x plus

1014
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:58,880
delta x and expand it to second order

1015
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:03,119
terms plus a remainder.

1016
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:07,680
And then if we take

1017
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:13,280
the difference of f at time

1018
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:15,680
t with b minus f at time z with b. Then

1019
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:21,520
we're looking at

1020
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:23,839
the sum of the increments from time t1

1021
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,920
to tn.

1022
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:29,359
And

1023
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:34,000
those increments are equal to the sums

1024
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:36,559
of the derivative of f

1025
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,440
times the increment of time plus a half

1026
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,079
the second derivative of f times the

1027
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,119
squared increment plus the remainder

1028
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:49,520
terms. And if we take the limits of

1029
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:53,359
those we get the integral of frime

1030
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:55,760
dbs plus a half the second the integral

1031
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:58,880
of the second derivative. So tailaylor

1032
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:03,359
series gives us this formula

1033
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,520
and um we can think of

1034
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:10,000
you know developing a notation with eo

1035
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:16,240
calculus which is that our sort of

1036
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:21,119
differential of f at bs is equal to

1037
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:24,960
fprime of bs dbs plus a half fp prime

1038
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:27,760
times at bs times

1039
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,680
the squared of

1040
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,839
db which is equal to ds the increment of

1041
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,400
time.

1042
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,400
So this is our etos formula

1043
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:43,359
shortorthhand

1044
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:46,160
and uh this uh shortorthhand

1045
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:50,000
corresponds in a similar way to

1046
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:52,880
derivatives and anti-derivatives

1047
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,720
where sort of here's the stochastic

1048
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,480
differential equation and here's the

1049
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,960
solution to that stochcastic

1050
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:07,839
differential equation on the top.

1051
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:12,160
Now um what's really

1052
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:17,119
neat and very powerful is that

1053
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:21,280
if we want to solve for the integral of

1054
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:26,160
a function. So suppose our objective is

1055
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:30,680
to solve for the integral from 0 to t f

1056
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,680
of bs dbs.

1057
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:35,119
Well,

1058
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,119
if we have

1059
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,400
the anti-derivative

1060
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:42,960
of little f.

1061
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,960
So that means that the first derivative

1062
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:50,359
of capital f is

1063
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,359
equal to

1064
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,920
such that fprime

1065
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,920
is equal to f.

1066
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Then

1067
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:07,359
if we choose the anti-derivative

1068
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,000
with f of 0 equal to zero

1069
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:14,960
then we get

1070
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:19,280
f of bt minus f of b 0 is equal to this

1071
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:22,319
integral of the derivative of f

1072
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,160
dbs plus a half the integral of the

1073
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:26,000
second derivative of capital f which is

1074
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,480
simply fprime.

1075
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,160
So this formula

1076
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,799
is what we just derived for

1077
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:38,400
itto's formula.

1078
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:43,920
And if we

1079
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:47,200
solve for this first term on the right,

1080
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:50,079
then that's equal to f of bt minus a

1081
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,520
half the integral of the first

1082
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:57,039
derivative of frime of bsds.

1083
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,920
So what's what's neat as a sort of

1084
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:03,440
technique in stochcastic calculus is

1085
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,760
that if we want to

1086
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,480
integrate

1087
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,280
a function little f

1088
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:17,119
of bs dbs

1089
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:19,119
then we can just apply eto's formula

1090
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:20,640
in reverse

1091
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,799
and

1092
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,839
characterize as the anti-derivative of

1093
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:27,920
little f at bt minus a half that

1094
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:30,640
defining the anti-derivative to have f

1095
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:34,079
of 0 equal to zero.

1096
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:39,520
Now let's apply this just for the case

1097
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:42,000
where capital f of x= x capital f prime

1098
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:45,680
the derivative is one and the second

1099
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:49,359
derivative is zero.

1100
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:52,000
Um then the integral of DBS

1101
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:54,640
is equal to BT

1102
01:04:52,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and um

1103
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:03,200
let's see so so basically um the

1104
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,280
integral of

1105
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:09,039
BS DBS is equal to capital F of BT which

1106
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,520
is BT

1107
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,440
and then plus minus a half the second

1108
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,280
derivative

1109
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,960
or the first deriv

1110
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:21,440
the second derivative of f which is

1111
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:25,200
zero. So this gives us this result.

1112
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:28,760
Um and if we consider capital f equaling

1113
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,760
a half x^2

1114
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:37,200
then little f is equal to x

1115
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:41,280
and little f prime is equal to 1. And so

1116
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:43,839
we get the integral of bs dbs is f of bt

1117
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:47,039
minus that which is a half bt ^2 minus a

1118
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:49,839
half t. So this gives us sort of a a

1119
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:52,240
verification of the limiting results we

1120
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:55,119
went through before with these eto

1121
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:59,920
integrals.

1122
01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:02,240
Okay. The next step is to extend eto's

1123
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,760
formula to functions of more than one

1124
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,480
variable.

1125
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:10,799
So we basically want to go from sort of

1126
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:14,079
f ofx.

1127
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:18,799
So one variable

1128
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:22,960
fs we want to go to two variables

1129
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:26,480
functions f and we'll write the notation

1130
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:30,960
of s comma x

1131
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:32,720
um which maps basically

1132
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,400
let's see

1133
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:41,359
the time space cross

1134
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:45,280
the or the time range r plus cross the

1135
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:47,680
real line of x into the reals.

1136
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:50,880
And we're going to consider functions

1137
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:55,680
little f

1138
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:58,480
that are continuous to different orders

1139
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:00,880
in terms of the time variable and the

1140
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,559
space variable.

1141
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,079
So

1142
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:08,880
we have um

1143
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:14,000
this notation C super one comma 2

1144
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:17,359
meaning that um it's continuous with uh

1145
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,960
first order derivative existing and

1146
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:24,640
continuous and second order derivative

1147
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:28,799
with respect to x and continuous.

1148
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:31,599
And so we have a tailaylor series for

1149
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:35,920
increments of this function little f now

1150
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:38,079
of two variables which has the

1151
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:42,240
multi-dimensional

1152
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:45,599
d= 2 tailaylor series formulation

1153
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,920
and it equals

1154
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:51,680
the f

1155
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:54,240
without the increments on t and x plus

1156
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,200
delta t * the partial of f with respect

1157
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:00,559
respect to t plus delta x * the partial

1158
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,520
of f with respect to x. And then we have

1159
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,960
the part the second order partial

1160
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:12,319
differential terms. And the only ones

1161
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:14,880
that are going to be of interest are the

1162
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:18,480
second order partial of f with respect

1163
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:22,159
to x which be will be multiplied by

1164
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:25,759
delta x^2. the other second order terms

1165
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:27,759
will actually be of small order uh delta

1166
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:31,440
t.

1167
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:34,719
And um with this

1168
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:38,960
second order tailor approximation,

1169
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:40,719
we're able to derive that the function f

1170
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,159
of tbt

1171
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:48,000
is equal to the initial value plus an

1172
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:52,000
integral with over time

1173
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,359
of a function of the brownian motion ds

1174
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,759
plus an integral over increments of the

1175
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:01,839
brownian motion.

1176
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:04,640
plus 12 this integral of the second

1177
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:09,359
partial of f with respect to dx^2.

1178
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:12,640
And this integral here ends up being

1179
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:14,239
multiplied or being integrated with

1180
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:20,000
respect to the increments of time

1181
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:21,679
because the delta x squ terms are uh

1182
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,520
infinitely

1183
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:30,560
equivalent to increments ds.

1184
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:35,839
So um so for this uh

1185
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:38,239
formula um we have here if we look at

1186
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:42,159
the difference in the little f function

1187
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:45,279
from time zero to t it equals the right

1188
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:48,400
hand side. So this top formula here is

1189
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:52,400
simply taking this second order

1190
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:55,679
tailaylor series and looking at the

1191
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:58,000
increment from 0 to t and what that

1192
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:00,640
equals.

1193
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:05,120
And what we get is a sum of two terms.

1194
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:07,600
an integral with respect to time of

1195
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,159
the partial with respect to time plus

1196
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,040
the half the second derivative of f with

1197
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:17,280
respect to x.

1198
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:18,880
And um with this notation

1199
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:22,400
for

1200
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:27,920
the value of little f

1201
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:29,920
um what's important to notice is that if

1202
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,120
the argument

1203
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:36,880
in the time integral

1204
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,120
if that's equal to zero

1205
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:43,040
then

1206
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,040
this will be a martingale.

1207
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:51,120
because the second term is an integral

1208
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,440
of

1209
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:55,920
terms times increments of the brownie in

1210
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,239
motion and the increments of the brownie

1211
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,800
in motion all have expectation equal to

1212
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:04,960
zero. So we'll have the possibility of

1213
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,640
this function being a martingale if

1214
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:12,320
that's true. And this

1215
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:16,239
integrant equaling zero is equivalent to

1216
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:20,000
this partial differential equation

1217
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:24,880
on the little f. So there's this

1218
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:29,840
connection between uh martingales

1219
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:33,520
and partial uh differential equations

1220
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:40,320
for f when we're thinking of a process f

1221
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:44,560
of t. So if little f is a martingale

1222
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:47,520
um it will turn out that the partial

1223
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:50,400
of f with respect to t will equal minus

1224
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:54,000
a half d^2 fdx^2 which is a pde

1225
01:11:50,400 --> 01:12:00,159
condition. Now the other thing we want

1226
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:04,320
actually for this to exist is um that

1227
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:06,880
the variance of the function

1228
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,840
f of tbt

1229
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,920
which is bounded by the squared

1230
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:16,320
expectation

1231
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:18,560
um is uh finite

1232
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:21,360
and so

1233
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:25,440
this will be finite.

1234
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:29,760
the variance if that

1235
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:32,640
second term has finite variance. And so

1236
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,239
for that to have finite variance, it's

1237
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,000
the variance is the integral of the

1238
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:40,719
square of that argument dfdx

1239
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,120
with respect to time.

1240
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:47,040
And so

1241
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:51,920
all right. Um now what's interesting

1242
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:57,040
with this EDO formula is um

1243
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:59,679
we can apply it to a function little f

1244
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:04,080
which is the exponential

1245
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:05,840
of sigma x minus sigma^ 2 t / 2.

1246
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:10,560
And

1247
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:12,640
importantly um well let's see this d

1248
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,960
partial of f with respect to t does

1249
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:20,640
equal minus a half sigma^ 2 f and so

1250
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,800
this um is actually a partial

1251
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,920
differential equation

1252
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:30,800
uh for little f

1253
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:33,120
and but df dx is equal to sigma f the

1254
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:37,440
second partial of f respect to x is

1255
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:40,800
sigma square f and itto's formula

1256
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:44,000
if we expand it out gives us this

1257
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:48,080
expression for little f

1258
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:51,520
and um this

1259
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:53,199
function little f is in fact a

1260
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:59,280
martingale

1261
01:13:53,199 --> 01:14:06,320
if we look at the expected value of f

1262
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:09,920
given f of 0 0 um it equals 1. Now f of

1263
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:17,280
0 0 is the exponential of

1264
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:21,760
uh basically zero which is one and but

1265
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:27,840
this function f little f if we plug in

1266
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:30,159
bt for x it's a scaled lognormal random

1267
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:35,600
variable.

1268
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:38,080
So this little f evaluated at x equal to

1269
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,239
bt. So it's a transformation of the

1270
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:45,040
brownian motion

1271
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:48,320
process path bt by this uh function um

1272
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,320
is actually a scaled lognormal random

1273
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,600
variable.

1274
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:57,040
And so e to the sigma bt minus sig half

1275
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:00,480
sigma^ 2 t is a scaled logn normal. And

1276
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,719
the expected value of this e to the

1277
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,920
sigma bt is actually equal to e to the

1278
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:08,960
1/2 sigma^ 2 t. We proved that I believe

1279
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,760
in a problem set. And so the expectation

1280
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:16,000
of f of tbt is going to actually equal

1281
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:21,679
one for all t. So this little f is in

1282
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:28,239
fact a uh martingale.

1283
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:31,679
Now um let's see with Brownian motion uh

1284
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:38,400
with drift the ruin problem we can

1285
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:40,560
actually use some sort of eto I u

1286
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,960
process ideas

1287
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:49,040
uh to deal with this um with this

1288
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:52,000
problem where we assume that xt is a

1289
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:55,040
brownie in motion with drift mu and

1290
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,400
variance parameter sigma squar. So

1291
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:02,239
here's its formula

1292
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:06,239
stochcastic differential equation for XT

1293
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:12,400
and we're interested in what's the

1294
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:17,280
probability of stopping at A before B

1295
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:21,920
where the stopping time tow is the first

1296
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:23,679
time T that hits A or minus B.

1297
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,120
And

1298
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,239
this

1299
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,760
argument is one that's uh very typical

1300
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:33,920
of

1301
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:36,719
uh quantitative finance developments I

1302
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:40,320
guess by mathematicians

1303
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:43,360
um and uh I it's actually a very neat

1304
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:46,400
argument where um I don't think I could

1305
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,800
ever have derived this but uh the

1306
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:52,239
derivation using martingale theory is

1307
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:54,880
really very elegant and so let's

1308
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:57,880
consider trying to solve for this

1309
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,880
probability

1310
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:04,320
by using martingale theory. So let's

1311
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,520
consider

1312
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:10,560
a martingale.

1313
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:15,440
Let's try to define a martingale

1314
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:18,880
with value h of xt

1315
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:20,480
defining mt

1316
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:26,640
where

1317
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:31,440
the tow is the same stopping time

1318
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:33,600
and the condition on h is going to be

1319
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:39,040
that if

1320
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:42,400
we sort of are at the value xt= A then

1321
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:46,239
the probability is one and if we start

1322
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,800
at minus B the probability is zero. So

1323
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:52,400
this is fixing the sort of terminal

1324
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:58,719
conditions of the function h when it

1325
01:17:52,400 --> 01:18:03,280
hits the uh limits a or minus b. Well,

1326
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:06,000
we can if we have a martingale that

1327
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:09,280
satisfies this

1328
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,520
function h of xt

1329
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:15,360
then the expectation of the stopped

1330
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:20,640
martingale is simply equal to the

1331
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:24,480
probability that x tow equals a.

1332
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:27,600
And uh

1333
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:29,679
by the martingale property

1334
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,719
the value

1335
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:36,560
of or the expectation of the stopped

1336
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:41,199
time is equal to the m0 the initial

1337
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:45,440
value of the uh h function. Now the

1338
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:48,080
initial value is the value when x is

1339
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:51,679
equal to zero. So we're starting at zero

1340
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:57,760
with the x process and it either moves

1341
01:18:51,679 --> 01:19:02,960
uh and hits a or hits minus b. So in

1342
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:05,040
order for this h function to be a

1343
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:08,640
martingale

1344
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:12,239
we have to have that the pd condition is

1345
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:14,080
satisfied on h. So the partial of h with

1346
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:16,239
respect to t is equal to minus a half

1347
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,000
the second partial of h with respect to

1348
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:22,080
dx.

1349
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And so if this h function which is the

1350
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:30,320
probability of hitting a first

1351
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,920
depends just on the value of

1352
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:37,280
xt.

1353
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:40,560
Then it equals h of mu t plus sigma bt

1354
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:44,880
substituting in for what xt is. So we

1355
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:48,640
can work with the function

1356
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:50,880
little f equal to h of mu t plus sigma

1357
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:54,400
x.

1358
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,239
And if the partial of f with respect to

1359
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:00,719
t

1360
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:03,600
which is by chain rule mu h prime of mu

1361
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:06,480
t plus sigma x if that equals the second

1362
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:09,280
partial of f with respect to x. The

1363
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:13,040
second partial derivative of h with

1364
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:17,040
respect to x is sigma^ squ hp prime.

1365
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:20,080
Then this pde condition says we have

1366
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:23,360
this relationship this differential

1367
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:26,800
equation for h although it's in the

1368
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:29,520
first derivative of h.

1369
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:32,640
But we can then

1370
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:36,719
rewrite this as the second derivative of

1371
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:40,000
h evaluated at argument y is minus a

1372
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:42,320
constant times the first derivative of

1373
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,560
h.

1374
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,520
And so

1375
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,360
we can solve that equation

1376
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:54,560
by

1377
01:20:49,360 --> 01:21:00,480
noting that sort of hp prime over h

1378
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:05,159
prime is equal to d by dx of

1379
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:05,159
log of h prime.

1380
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:14,080
So the derivative of the log of h prime

1381
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:17,480
is a constant. The solution to that is a

1382
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,480
linear function.

1383
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,960
And so we then end up being able to

1384
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:26,560
solve for little h of y equaling this

1385
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:28,719
formula. So this is the solution to this

1386
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,120
problem.

1387
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:33,520
All right, let's see. We we're at the

1388
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:36,880
end of our lecture today. So next next

1389
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,960
time we'll finish up these notes uh

1390
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,640
talking about

1391
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,960
standard

1392
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:47,199
uh processes

1393
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:50,800
where our sort of a function for the

1394
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:53,280
drift and our b function for the

1395
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:56,480
volatilities have to satisfy certain

1396
01:21:53,280 --> 01:22:00,239
properties. And if you read ahead in

1397
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:02,719
these notes, you'll see that we need the

1398
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:06,480
probability of sort of integrating the

1399
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:09,760
drift over time has to be finite and

1400
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:12,080
absolute integral and the integral of

1401
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:15,280
the squared b's

1402
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:17,760
have to also be finite. If those were

1403
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:21,199
not finite then you would say have sort

1404
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:24,560
of explosive behavior of these integrals

1405
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:26,480
which uh where they won't exist. So

1406
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:30,239
these are reasonable properties to

1407
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:32,880
assume for those and anyway we'll go

1408
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:35,600
through some interesting results here

1409
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,600
with this particular problem um and then

1410
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:41,360
turn on to stochcastic differential

1411
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:44,600
equations next time. All right.

1412
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,600
Thank you.
