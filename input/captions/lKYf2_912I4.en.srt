1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,920
All right, welcome back everyone. Uh,

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm Ben Neil. I'm here to chair the the

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,240
last scientific session before our

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,559
plenary speaker, Robert Pinch, takes the

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
stage. And, uh, I think we're going to

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,720
move slightly more translationally

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,640
oriented at the end of the V2F

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
symposium. And I think that's nice to go

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,480
from variance to, you know, functions

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,760
and mechanisms with the idea of getting

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,640
to therapeutics. So I'll uh invite our

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,880
first speaker up here uh VJ Sankarin a

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,559
colleague of mine at Boston Children's

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,399
Howard Hughes investigator and and

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,320
really

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,840
demonstrates I think how basic science

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,280
can have such clear impact on drug

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,920
development when you understand the

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,000
biology. So teach us some biology.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,680
>> Awesome. Well, thank you so much Ben. Um

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,920
and huge thanks to the organizers for um

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,239
the opportunity to come and participate

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,160
in this amazing symposium. Now before I

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,000
get started, I just want to give a

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,440
little bit of my own perspective because

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I've been here all day and I've had a

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,920
for you know I've been fortunate to hear

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
a variety of the talks and I think we

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
started off with Ruth telling us that

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,200
there are now 9,000 associations with

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,000
BMI. We know in blood cell phenotypes or

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,320
height we have thousands if not tens of

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,119
thousands of associations. So in many

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,200
ways we should be motivated to try to

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,960
develop these scalable approaches that

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,159
you've heard about throughout throughout

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,920
the the the day and certainly we're

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,960
excited and interested in trying to do

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,720
that. But my goal in the next 25 minutes

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
or so is going to be to give you a

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,400
perspective of maybe there's a

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,280
complimentary

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,280
benefit to really trying to wrestle a

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
single association down to the ground.

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,200
And so I'm going to try to tell you

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,040
about one locus and one association that

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,840
we really want to try to mechanistically

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,079
and hopefully um therapeutically try to

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,600
try to really understand. But before I

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,600
get there, I want to contextualize a

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,200
little bit of why we do what we do. So

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,000
each of us is thought to have

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,240
approximately 100,000 blood or

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
hematoportic stem cells that reside

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
within our bone marrow and that are

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,879
responsible for maintaining and

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
replenishing our blood and immune

58
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,200
systems throughout our lifetime.

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
Each of these stem cells needs to be

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,239
able to produce millions of platelets,

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
red blood cells, and a variety of white

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
blood cells throughout our lifetime in

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,920
order to maintain our health and and

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,840
immune function. Now, we understand a

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
great deal about how this process of

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,319
blood and immune cell production occurs.

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,239
And yet, most of our understanding of

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,160
this comes from really elegant and

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,840
informative studies in model systems,

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,080
including mice and zebra fish, which

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,280
have and continue to teach us a great

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,959
deal about this process. And yet often

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,200
when we make observations in our

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,840
patients or from interindividual

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,920
variation in humans, we have challenges

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,160
in trying to map that directly onto our

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,400
understanding of this process of blood

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,160
cell production or hematopoesis. And so

79
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
we view this not as a limitation but

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,080
rather as an opportunity to take

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,239
advantage of observations that we make

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,200
in humans to better understand this

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,879
process. And our interest in this really

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,959
started now about 22 or 23 years ago.

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,280
And at the time we were interested in

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,800
trying to understand why the most common

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
monogenic disorders in the world

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
including cickle cell disease is

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,720
depicted in this electron microraph as

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,400
well as betathalmia had such incredible

91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,640
clinical variability. We knew that

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
patients with this diagnosis could

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
actually be completely asymptomatic or

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,000
largely asymptomatic and yet we knew

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,879
that many patients could often be

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,599
severely affected requiring weekly or or

97
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,560
more frequent um hospitalizations.

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,840
And at the time we knew from decades of

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,599
work that one key factor mediating

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,680
interindividual variability in the

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,360
clinical severity of the disease was the

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,879
level of fetal hemoglobin that these

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
patients expressed. So typically during

104
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
human development there's predominant

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,959
expression in uterero of this fetal form

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
of hemoglobin or gammoglobin is shown in

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,519
the green and shortly after birth this

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,840
switches off and there's upregulation of

109
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,760
the adult beta heemoglobin molecule is

110
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
shown in the purple and this is what is

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,680
mutated in both cickle cell disease as

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,479
well as in betthalmia

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,320
and so continued persistent production

114
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,400
of this gammoglobin molecule can

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,320
ameliate the severity of of these beta

116
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,360
hemoglobin disorders and that had been

117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,120
known for decades decades. Yet the

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
precise molecular regulation of this

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
process was not well understood. And so

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
after years of failing to try to

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
understand this process through a

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
variety of systems, we were fortunate

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,880
because we were able to be involved with

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
some of the earliest genomewide

125
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,560
association studies initially in

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
non-anmic individuals and then working

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
with Joel Hershorn, we were able to

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,479
replicate these associations initially

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
in individuals with cickle cell disease.

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
And these studies collectively reveal

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,759
three major regions of the genome

132
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,919
associated with interindividual

133
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,040
variation in fetal hemoglobin including

134
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,680
this association on chromosome 2. And

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,720
these this in these initial observations

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,240
really led us to go on to functionally

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,240
show that BCLNA serves as a key and

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
direct repressor of the gamoglobin gene

139
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,199
such that when it's well expressed which

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,880
is happening in all of your bone marrow

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
cells right now there's repression of

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,720
gammoglobin and predominant expression

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
of the adult form of hemoglobin and at

144
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,120
the earlier stages of development

145
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,360
there's lower BL1A expressed at the

146
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,360
protein level and this then deresses the

147
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,360
gammoglobin gene and favors production

148
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
of fetal hemoglobin.

149
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,199
But as Molina mentioned earlier today,

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
this of course did not just teach us

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
about a fundamental developmental

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,080
process, but thanks to an extensive

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,320
amount of subsequent translational and

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,120
uh clinical work. This has now led to

155
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,880
the development of now FDA approved

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,400
therapies that target this axis

157
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:54,320
particularly uh exel or cast jevy which

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,199
um is from vertex and and um crisper

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,800
therapeutics. And this drug acts by

160
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,479
actually taking this repressor of the

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,720
gamoglobin genes BCL1a and targeting an

162
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,680
arythroidid specific enhancer of this

163
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,600
gene to thereby downregulate BC1a as

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,400
Jesse was mentioning and this thereby

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,520
derpresses the fetal hemoglobin genes

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,600
allowing their robust expression and

167
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
thereby ameliating clinical symptoms in

168
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,039
patients as has been borne out. And so

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,880
this early success really for us has

170
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,479
served as a motivation to not only think

171
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,160
about diseases like cickle cell disease

172
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,639
that affect the red cell lineage but

173
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,560
more broadly think about how we could

174
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
take advantage of human genetic

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,280
variation across the alyic spectrum to

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
better understand this process. Now much

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120
of our focus has really been on how

178
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,840
blood cell production occurs in

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,560
non-malignant states or how this process

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,520
might be uh impacting rare blood

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,440
disorders. But over the past decade,

182
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,800
thanks to a lot of work, including work

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,039
from this community, particularly from

184
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Steve McCarol, Ben Eert, and others,

185
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,440
we've learned about the fact that

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,319
sematic mosaicism we know is widespread

187
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,479
in all of our tissues as we age. And

188
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,639
this has particularly been notable and

189
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,280
well worked out in the context of the

190
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,880
blood system where there can be cancer

191
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,479
driver mutations acquired in blood stem

192
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,639
cells that then result in clonal

193
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,800
expansion of the stem cells. even the

194
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,240
absence of an overt malignancy, a

195
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,880
condition that's been termed clonal

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,120
hematopois of indeterminant potential.

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,520
And approximately 10 years ago or so

198
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,000
when this condition was first um

199
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,080
described, it was thought to be a

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
invariable precursor to the development

201
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,240
of a variety of blood cancers including

202
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,560
myotus plastic syndrome and acute myoid

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
leukemia. It was also known that this

204
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,400
condition could predispose people to a

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,319
variety of other comorbidities including

206
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,199
cardiovascular disease and other

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,039
conditions. But this progression of

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
course as shown here was thought to just

209
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,080
be an inevitable evolutionary process.

210
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,360
And yet over the past several years

211
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,759
we've learned that actually it's very

212
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,280
hard to predict even if one individual

213
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,080
has such a mutation what is the

214
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,319
likelihood of going on to either see a

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,440
clone with one of these drivers such as

216
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,360
DNM T3A TET 2 um so and so forth is that

217
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
clone going to expand? And we know that

218
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,160
even for individuals with the same exact

219
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,319
driver mutation, there can be no

220
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,039
expansion over time, regression of the

221
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,160
clone in some instances, or there can be

222
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,160
some growth at variable rates. Moreover,

223
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
as shown in the y-axis here from this

224
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,959
study in in in the UK, we know that

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,560
individuals have variable rates of

226
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,159
progression to blood cancer such as

227
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
acute myoid leukemia with some

228
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,599
individuals having no increased risk

229
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,200
even if they have one of these driver

230
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,440
mutations compared to the general

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,519
population. and yet other individuals

232
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,080
even with the same driver mutation

233
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,560
having some increased rate.

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,640
So what underlies this variation? Well,

235
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,040
we know of a variety of factors. So we

236
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,640
know from both observational and

237
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,519
interventional studies in humans as well

238
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,240
as studies in model systems that chronic

239
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,640
inflammation and some infectious

240
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,120
exposures can actually have a role in

241
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,279
enabling some clones to expand in in

242
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
circumstances. And so certainly this has

243
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,200
been and continues to be well studied

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
and is really the subject of a variety

245
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,680
of of of um studies in in model systems.

246
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,240
We know that exposure to some types of

247
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,560
chemicals and radiation can actually

248
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
allow some types of clones to expand

249
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,200
particularly in the context of treatment

250
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,240
with chemotherapy for solid tumors. We

251
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,200
know that clones with mutations in TP53,

252
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,240
PPM1D and Czech 2 can often be seen to

253
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,880
expand in those settings. But what about

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
the role of germline genetic variation?

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,360
And could there be either genetic

256
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,680
variants within that are inherited that

257
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,800
either affect the likelihood of a clone

258
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,839
expanding or that protect an individual

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,399
from that expansion. And so we thought

260
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,040
perhaps we could try to identify such

261
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,480
varants. And this was the work of a

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
medical fellow in our laboratory

263
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
Goraval. Gorov got interested in this

264
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,519
problem and really wanted to try to

265
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
understand not just what were the

266
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,320
variants that were there because there

267
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,160
had been other efforts to try to

268
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,399
identify those but really what were the

269
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,600
variants that were most either

270
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,399
protective or put individuals at the

271
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,040
greatest risk of progression or clonal

272
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,120
expansion with with clonal hematopoesis.

273
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,880
And so, Gorov took studies that had been

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
both um previously done from a variety

275
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,760
of bio banks as well as um other studies

276
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,240
that we and and and other colleagues

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,279
could do in a variety of large bio banks

278
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,000
and could from a population of about

279
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,720
700,000 or more individuals look at

280
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,800
individuals with detectable clonal

281
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,720
hematopoesis across these various

282
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,720
studies. And then it just asked what

283
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,000
variants were either putting individuals

284
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,839
at risk of having clonal hematopois or

285
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
what were protecting individuals. And

286
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,120
this really allowed him to look at a

287
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,120
variety of variants, many of which were

288
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,519
increasing the risk subtly but

289
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,000
significantly for for acquiring um

290
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,360
colonal hematopois. But Gorov got

291
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
particularly interested in this variant

292
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,160
on chromosome 17 that actually had a

293
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,000
pretty had the most substantial

294
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,519
protective effect against clonal

295
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,560
hematopois.

296
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,519
Now looking at this hllet type this had

297
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,360
a alil dose dependent protection against

298
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,440
clonal hematopois with individuals

299
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,760
having two copies of this haplletype

300
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,480
having about a 30% reduction in

301
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,880
acquiring clonal hematopois.

302
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,160
This was protective in contrast to some

303
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
of the other variants that have been

304
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,320
described as protecting against specific

305
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,079
types of clonal hematopoesis. This was

306
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
protective against all the major forms

307
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,640
of clonal hematopoises we could see

308
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,160
including DNMT3A TE 2 mutant clonal

309
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,560
hematopouis ASX1 and Jack 2 and

310
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,399
importantly and in contrast to what had

311
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
been seen for other variants. This

312
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,720
protected individuals from acquiring a

313
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,720
variety of blood cancers including from

314
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,880
um acute myoid leukemia and the myo

315
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,519
proliferative neoplasms as well as all

316
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,640
forms of myoid malignancies as far as we

317
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,399
could um see from from these large bio

318
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,839
banks. In addition, there was a subtle

319
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,680
but significant decrease in all blood

320
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,200
counts where we could see that there was

321
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,720
a reduction in platelet counts, a

322
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,440
variety of white blood cell counts as

323
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
well as red cell counts. But even in

324
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,120
individuals with two copies of this

325
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,200
hletype, the counts still remained in

326
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,279
the normal range that's typically seen

327
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,360
in this setting. If we then looked

328
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
across a variety of other phenotypes,

329
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,000
other than the impact on clonal

330
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,360
hematopoesis, the impact on blood counts

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,279
that I mentioned as well as the

332
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,120
protection from blood cancers, we did

333
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,880
not see any other phenotypic

334
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,720
associations with this particular

335
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,399
variant. Really suggesting that it was

336
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
relatively selective for its effect in

337
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,480
hematopois.

338
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,680
So how was this variant acting? And

339
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,160
finally I just mention one other thing

340
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,200
which is this variant was actually found

341
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,720
across almost all global populations.

342
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
But I would just note that this has been

343
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,120
maintained at relatively low frequencies

344
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,880
with the highest frequencies seen in uh

345
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,240
a number of European populations

346
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,920
typically in the four to 6% range with

347
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,440
other populations having this variant

348
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,040
suggesting an ancient origin but

349
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,160
suggesting it was maintained at

350
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,920
relatively low frequencies. So how is

351
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,440
this variant acting? Well, if we looked

352
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,079
within the hletype, there was only a few

353
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,399
variants within that hllet type and only

354
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,040
a single variant we found that was

355
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,600
actually overlapping any kind of

356
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,959
functional annotated region. And in this

357
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
particular case, it was a region that

358
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,279
was actually accessible within

359
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
hematopoic stem cells. This was also a

360
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,519
region that was bound by gata 2 and a

361
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
variety of co-actors that are known to

362
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
be important for transcriptional

363
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,160
regulation within blood stem cells. We

364
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,560
could also see that this region of

365
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,600
chromatin accessibility was selective

366
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,360
for early blood stem cells and very

367
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,040
primitive progenitors. But then this

368
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,880
region became inaccessible as blood stem

369
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,399
cells underwent further differentiation

370
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,480
really suggesting that this was

371
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,040
selectively accessible within that

372
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,880
compartment. And in addition, if we used

373
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,519
either correlations between attack

374
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,800
sequencing and RNA sequencing or looked

375
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,560
at long range chromatin looping data, we

376
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,160
could see that this regulatory region

377
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,399
had interactions with the promoter of

378
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,959
MSI2.

379
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,199
Looking broadly within the region and

380
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,880
over several megabases that surrounds

381
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,240
this particular variant, what we could

382
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,240
see was that MSI2 was the only gene

383
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,000
expressed within blood stem cells and

384
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,639
none of the other genes in that local

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,560
region were expressed um in in this

386
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,240
context. If we looked at correlations

387
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,880
between the degree of chromatin

388
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,880
accessibility in single cells in that

389
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,199
region and the expression of MSI2, we

390
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,399
saw a nice correlation between those

391
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,279
really suggesting that this was a

392
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,959
regulatory element affecting MSI2. But

393
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
to directly get at that, we could take

394
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,959
blood stem cells from healthy human

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,440
donors, introduce crisper eye constructs

396
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,120
that allow us to transiently suppress

397
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
gene expression from a regulatory

398
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
element within these primary um stem

399
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,199
cells. And we can see across a variety

400
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
of guide RNAs targeting this regulatory

401
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,040
element that we could selectively

402
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
suppress MSI2 expression. But we did not

403
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,560
see changes in any other gene expression

404
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,160
locally. Now MSI2 has been really well

405
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
studied by a number of labs, some of

406
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,240
which I'm describing here as being

407
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,680
critical for progression in a variety of

408
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,360
blood cancers and other cancers and has

409
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,360
been known to be important in in some

410
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
stem cell populations. But our goal is

411
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,360
really to understand how is this variant

412
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,880
acting to protect individuals from both

413
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,199
acquiring clonal hematopois and from um

414
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,560
going on to develop blood cancers. And

415
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,000
so to start to get at that we really

416
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
wanted to try to delineate what are some

417
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,680
of the variant effects. So at first we

418
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,000
took this regulatory element with both

419
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,600
the um reference and and the

420
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,240
non-reference alil. We could put it

421
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,560
upstream of the endogenous MSI2 promoter

422
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,480
and then put this into blood um stem

423
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,279
cells from from healthy human donors and

424
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,959
then actually examine what is the

425
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,120
activity of this regulatory element

426
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,800
within a context that's relevant the

427
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,959
these primary hematopro stem and

428
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,360
progenitor cells. And critically what we

429
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,360
saw was that this enhancer element did

430
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,600
act as a typical enhancer in this

431
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,040
exogenous assay where we could see an

432
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,440
increase in in in in um regulatory

433
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,160
element activity. But this was partially

434
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
suppressed by by twofold by um simply

435
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,160
introducing this this variant associated

436
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,680
with resilience in individuals and that

437
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,759
protects individuals from acquiring

438
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,000
either colonal hematopaths or these

439
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,079
blood cancers.

440
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,959
We when we looked at the variant effect

441
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,920
we could see that this actually

442
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,920
disrupted a canonical GATA motif that is

443
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,240
bound by gata 2 and this is the typical

444
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,199
motif for this. And indeed if we took

445
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,959
hetererozygous donor stem cells pull

446
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
down gata 2 we could actually see

447
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,519
reduced occupancy of gata 2 in the alil

448
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,920
associated with resilience from clonal

449
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,720
hematopoesis as well as protection from

450
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,480
blood cancers. And similarly, if we took

451
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
accessible chromatin reads from

452
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
individuals who are hetererozygous for

453
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,360
this variant, once again we can see that

454
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,360
there was reduced chromatin

455
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
accessibility at this element. Really

456
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,920
suggesting that this was disrupting a

457
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,720
canonical gata 2 motif that was critical

458
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,400
for binding of gata 2 and thereby

459
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,480
resulted in reduced both enhancer

460
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,199
activity as well as reduced gata 2

461
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,240
occupancy. Now, unfortunately, we did

462
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,319
not have a direct way to precisely edit

463
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
this particular variant in, but we could

464
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,559
show using our reporter systems that

465
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,079
introducing small micro deletions into

466
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,360
this element to actually mimic the

467
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,440
effect of the um the variant. So, we

468
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,919
could create these small microdeions

469
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,919
with paired guides within the enhancer.

470
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,600
And we could also target MSI 2 directly.

471
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,320
And when we do this, we see that there's

472
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,760
about a 20 to 30% reduction in MSI2

473
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,240
expression within the stem cell

474
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,919
compartment at the mRNA level. And we

475
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,880
can also see by intracellular staining

476
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,960
for MSI2 protein that within this stem

477
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,200
cell compartment there's a reduction in

478
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
protein levels either subtly by the

479
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,000
enhancer or more profoundly by directly

480
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,760
targeting MSI2 itself. So what were the

481
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,760
phenotypic consequences of this on the

482
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,520
stem blood stem cells? Well, if we

483
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,080
initially look and perturb either in in

484
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,000
um in this case adult or cord blood

485
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
derived um stem and progenitor cells

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
from the blood system, we can see in

487
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,280
this case in the context of adult stem

488
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,720
cells that there's a reduction both in

489
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,960
the fraction of cells that are um these

490
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
long-term um stem cells. This is using

491
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,400
phenotypic markers and we can see a more

492
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
profound reduction by directly targeting

493
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
MSI 2 and this was also true if we look

494
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,640
at the number of stem cells that's

495
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,320
present. Um, we could also see similar

496
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
results which I'm not showing you here

497
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,559
from cord blood. And so this occurred

498
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,679
across a variety of stem cell sources.

499
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,440
However, ultimately our gold standard in

500
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,280
the field of stem cell biology is to

501
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,200
take these cells from healthy human

502
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,360
donors or that are manipulated and

503
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,360
transplant them into immuno deficient

504
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,880
and kit mutant mouse recipients and then

505
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,440
wait four months for long-term

506
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,200
engraftment. And so if we introduce an

507
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,440
equivalent number of cells either with

508
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,320
the edit at a benign safe harbor locus

509
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,720
AVS1 or in this setting with a

510
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,200
microdeion of an enhancer or targeting

511
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,600
the knockout we actually see that if we

512
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,440
wait four months there's a reduction in

513
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,720
human engraftment in a dose dependent

514
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,360
manner depending on the degree of

515
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,400
reduction of MSI2 as shown here. This

516
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,400
was true across all lineages. So the we

517
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
had reduced engraftment across the stem

518
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,240
and progenitor cell compartment as

519
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,720
marked by CD34. The B cell compartment

520
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
is marked by CD19 as well as the myoid

521
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,880
cell compartment is marked by CD33 as

522
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,120
shown here. But interestingly, if we

523
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
took the marrow of the primary donors

524
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,080
and then actually replated them for

525
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,240
colonies, we actually saw an expansion

526
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,799
of the myoid cell colonies. And

527
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,559
importantly, we did see that there was

528
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,160
actually a skew towards myoid

529
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,760
differentiation. And this was consistent

530
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,840
with what we've known from studies in

531
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,880
mouse systems where it's been shown that

532
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,679
MSI2 is critical for the balance between

533
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,160
self renewal of stem cells uh producing

534
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,600
more of themselves and their ability to

535
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
undergo differentiation towards the

536
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,799
myoid lineages. And so this resilience

537
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,799
variant seems to actually be reducing

538
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,679
the likelihood of a stem cell undergoing

539
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,039
symmetric self renewal and uh make it

540
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,039
more likely that that stem cell will

541
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,880
undergo differentiation.

542
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,640
So what were the underlying mechanisms

543
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,360
by which this was acting? And to start

544
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,919
to get at that, we could conduct single

545
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,360
cell RNA sequencing in a sorted

546
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,360
compartment of the stem and progentor

547
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
cells enriched for stem cells. And then

548
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,440
we could examine differential gene

549
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,600
expression within molecularly defined

550
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,200
stem cells in that compartment. And this

551
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,799
allowed us to find a number of genes

552
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,720
that were differentially expressed

553
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,919
including most notably the most uh

554
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,080
downregulated gene was reassuringly MSI

555
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,000
2. And so this allowed us to look at

556
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,760
gene expression changes by modeling

557
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,679
variant effects in this setting in

558
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,360
primary human hematopro stem progentor

559
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,840
cells. But we also wanted to understand

560
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,919
since MSI2 was a well-known RNA binding

561
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,679
protein, what were its targets in this

562
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,840
setting? And so teaming up with Michael

563
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,760
Caras and his lab at Memorial Stone

564
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,080
Kettering, we could use this approach

565
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,080
called hypertribe where we could hook

566
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,720
MSI2 to an ADAR editing enzyme. And this

567
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,679
allowed us to look at endogenous targets

568
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,280
of MSI2 by turning this RNA binding

569
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,679
assay into essentially a sequencing

570
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,840
problem. And by deeply sequencing

571
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,360
primary human hematoproxim cells with

572
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,159
this construct present, we could

573
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,360
identify about 3,000 mrnas or so that

574
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,840
were bound by MSI2 or putitutively bound

575
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,440
by MSI2 based upon the edits. And

576
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,880
critically, we could find many more

577
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,760
targets that have been identified

578
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,440
before, but these targets match the

579
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,400
known binding sites from other

580
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,080
orthogonal approaches like clips seek or

581
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,520
and so forth that have identified the

582
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,440
targets and critically these were

583
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,159
enriched in the threep prime UTR of

584
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,159
these mRNAs as well.

585
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,000
We found that by looking at the

586
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
putitively edited targets, if we looked

587
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
at differential gene expression, there

588
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,440
was a down reggulation on average of

589
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,679
this gene expression. So this allowed us

590
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,360
to really focus in on a group of genes

591
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,520
that we could show was both

592
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,720
downregulated upon perturbation of the

593
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,720
MSI2 enhancer but that was also edited

594
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,440
uh upon introduction of this hypertribe

595
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,760
construct. And this identified both

596
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
known targets of MSI2 as well as some

597
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,640
novel targets including some key factors

598
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,679
important for stem cell self renewal and

599
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,640
factors that were important for um for

600
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,039
uh the the the regulation of stem cells.

601
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,440
And so this of course made us wonder if

602
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,080
we have this set of about 200 mrnas that

603
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,600
are down reggulated and bound by MSI2

604
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,440
could we learn something about how

605
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,440
they're playing a role potentially in

606
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,600
enabling um you know the activity of of

607
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,240
this particular context and so we could

608
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,320
examine ribosome profiling data that we

609
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,159
performed within primary human hematopro

610
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,000
stem and progenitor cells. This allowed

611
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
us to show that this set of about 200

612
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,320
mrnas was actually amongst the most

613
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,039
highly translated mRNAs within the

614
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,000
hematopic stem cells of human donors.

615
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,200
But moreover, we could also show that

616
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,080
this particular set of mRNAs if one

617
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,840
looks at mutant cells versus non-mutant

618
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,840
cells for example in TE 2 clonal

619
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,280
hematopouesis was actually upregulated

620
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,280
and we could see this across other

621
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,280
drivers such as DNMT3A as1 and so forth.

622
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,000
Moreover, if we looked at a variety of

623
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,320
AML survival data akin to what's seen

624
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,360
with MSI2 expression itself, the set of

625
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,880
genes was also associated with um worse

626
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,280
survival with increased expression

627
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,159
associated with that. But what about the

628
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,679
cooperivity between this particular

629
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,600
resilience variant and the acquired

630
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,120
sematic mutations that acquire that

631
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,720
occur in individuals? And so we teamed

632
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
up with Alex Bick at Vanderbilt

633
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,559
University and Yash Prashad in this lab.

634
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,080
And as you can see from the data I

635
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,760
showed initially from from George

636
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,760
Vicilio's lab, you can see that

637
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,679
individuals with clonal hematopois have

638
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
a variety of annual growth rates. And

639
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,520
here we're following individuals for a

640
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,640
median of six years in the bio view

641
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,640
cohort. But individuals with even one

642
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,360
copy of this variant actually had

643
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,440
decreased growth rates of these clones

644
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,280
in the setting of having pre-existing

645
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
clonal hematopesis at time one and then

646
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,600
following them to the second time point.

647
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,520
In addition, where individuals had

648
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,120
detectable clonal hematopesis at time

649
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,039
point.1 but then had disappearance of

650
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,799
that clone, we found that this

651
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,279
disappearance was much more likely

652
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,960
1.8fold more likely in the setting of

653
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,480
having this resilience variant. So not

654
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,400
only is it protecting individuals from

655
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,320
acquiring clonal hematopois, but

656
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,640
actually makes it more likely that that

657
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,840
clone will disappear. So could we model

658
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,640
this? Well, we could go on and edit ASX1

659
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,360
just as a typical driver mutation. If we

660
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,320
do that and we co-edit this benign safe

661
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,240
harbor locus a AVs1, we see that the

662
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,000
stem cells expand with this driver

663
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,640
mutation, we could suppress that

664
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,240
expansion in part by editing the uh

665
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,679
enhancer that I'd shown you before and

666
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,720
almost completely suppress that by

667
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,880
editing MSI2. We could see in this

668
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,360
setting moreover that um that uh we

669
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,279
could um see colony replating if we

670
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,640
introduce secondary colonies really a

671
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,240
feature of self-renewal that we're

672
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,640
seeing and this could be at least in

673
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,640
part suppressed by editing the enhancer.

674
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,440
And moreover, if we performed long-term

675
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
engraftment of these cells um into

676
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,559
xenotransplant recipients and just

677
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,159
waited, we could see an expansion of the

678
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,640
primitive stem cell compartment and this

679
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,360
could be at least in part suppressed by

680
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,400
um editing the enhancer. Moreover, we

681
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,480
could also use um

682
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,000
uh the reciprocal approach in

683
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,120
collaboration with Michael Carus' lab

684
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,159
where we could take an ASXL1 mutant

685
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,679
mouse recipient.

686
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,679
Maybe I'm not pointing this in the right

687
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,679
place.

688
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,240
Just go forward somehow.

689
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,360
Doesn't seem to be

690
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,279
Well, it'll maybe let me go forward. Um,

691
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,840
but using this approach, we could

692
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,840
actually Oh,

693
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
I didn't do anything bad. Oh, there we

694
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,760
go. Seems to be doing something perfect.

695
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,720
So, we could see that um by Thank you.

696
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,279
Um so we could see that by introducing

697
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,120
an ASXL1 mutant mouse and then

698
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,559
increasing the expression of MSI2 that

699
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,760
these mice actually have an expansion of

700
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,440
the stem cell compartment whereas

701
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,760
ordinarily these mice do not have any

702
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,960
phenotype. And at about eight months, we

703
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,880
see that there's a reduction in a

704
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,559
variety of blood counts and a variety of

705
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,200
signs of the fact that um these mice

706
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,440
then go on to uh

707
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,919
>> Oh, perfect.

708
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,760
>> Um these mice go on to have features

709
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,720
consistent with my plastic syndrome

710
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,919
including dis um disarotic

711
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,799
changes and and pelra huic type uh

712
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,360
nuclei and the neutrfils. And so what

713
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,840
I've shown you really is how by really

714
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,520
deeply diving into a single variant, we

715
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,440
can start to learn about mechanisms that

716
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,840
might actually both protect individuals

717
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,279
from acquiring sematic driver mutations

718
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,400
in a condition that we know as clonal

719
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,640
hematopoesis as well as that prevent

720
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
progression of those clones even once

721
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,320
acquired as shown both based upon our

722
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,000
longitudinal profiling data of

723
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,679
individuals as well as what we could

724
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,840
model. And I think what it really

725
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,120
suggests for us is of course this is not

726
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
the only protective variant but

727
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,159
certainly I think it suggests that by

728
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,240
really deeply understanding this maybe

729
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,200
we could identify strategies that not

730
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,200
only allow us to target cancers but

731
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,039
actually potentially prevent cancers in

732
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,520
the future as suggested in this uh

733
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,240
diagram and this poster from 1932 from

734
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,440
from Paris. And so our hope is really by

735
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,840
understanding some of these variant

736
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,320
mechanisms, what occurs in individuals

737
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,640
and what heritably allows individuals to

738
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,480
be protected from cancers and and

739
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,720
pre-malignant conditions that we could

740
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,880
understand more about this process. And

741
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
so with that um I just wanted to finish

742
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,279
up by acknowledging the people who've

743
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,600
really contributed to this work

744
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,600
particularly Gorov Agurwal uh a number

745
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
of of uh other lab members and our

746
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,559
collaborators as well as our funding

747
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,919
sources. And I want to thank you all

748
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,480
very much and I'm happy to take any

749
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,480
questions. Thank you.

750
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,840
remarkable talk and grace under fire.

751
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,080
So, even better. Uh, any questions for

752
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,760
VJ? Yeah, go ahead, Brad.

753
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:12,320
>> Yeah, that was awesome. So, the variant

754
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm just it's maybe just a a random uh

755
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,440
un unfortunate or I guess in some cases

756
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,760
fortunate event for individuals. Are

757
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,520
there other selection pressures? Like do

758
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,159
you do you see this as just a random

759
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,440
mutation? Do you have a phenotype in

760
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,080
other tissues?

761
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,080
>> Yeah.

762
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,000
>> If it's protective of leukemias and

763
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,440
stuff, would it ever be selected for? Is

764
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,399
there not enough, you know?

765
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,080
>> Yeah. So, um, so this this her I mean

766
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,240
this is an inherited variant that's

767
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,080
clearly occurred like early in in

768
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,559
history. It's interesting that it's been

769
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,919
maintained at low, you know, low al

770
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,360
frequencies. As far as we could tell

771
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,760
though, like I mentioned with the

772
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,520
phenomewide association studies, there's

773
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,120
no other major phenotypes that it's

774
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,240
associated with. But we just have to

775
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,760
remember that, you know, we're all

776
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,159
related probably, you know, we have

777
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,480
common relatives about 3,000 years ago.

778
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,799
And, you know, probably some of those

779
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,480
pressures that our relatives had to go

780
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,559
through, you know, exposure to a variety

781
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,039
of infectious ages, this might not have

782
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,720
been a beneficial, you know, variant in

783
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,399
this setting. But in the modern era

784
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,919
where we're worried it where we live,

785
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,679
you know, nice hopefully long lives, you

786
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,159
know, and and and are relatively

787
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,360
protected from some of those issues.

788
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,640
Hopefully this by mimicking this,

789
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,320
especially if there's, you know, there's

790
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,039
lots of drug developers, you know, I

791
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,880
this is out of my, you know, area of

792
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,480
expertise, but certainly this could be a

793
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,600
potential good target by mimicking this

794
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,919
effect. And so I think that that's

795
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,919
really our hope.

796
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,960
population.

797
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,840
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, so Brad was asking are

798
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,000
there populations at altitude or other

799
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,600
places? As far as we could tell, this

800
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
has been maintained at relatively low

801
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,159
frequencies across all populations, but

802
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,159
it's found across all populations.

803
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,799
>> Any other questions for VJ?

804
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,960
>> All right. Well, excellent talk. Lovely

805
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,960
biology as promised. Thanks for

806
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,960
listening.
