1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,160
okay good morning um really pleased to

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,320
see so many of you here at this uh

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,400
somewhat early hour uh my name is Will

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,879
Oliver I'm a professor in electrical

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,720
engineering and computer science that's

6
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,199
my home Department um also with

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,439
professor of of physics and I'm really

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,640
pleased to organize this day um where

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
we're going to talk about Quantum

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,400
Computing and before we get started just

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,160
want to thank the uh the College of

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,120
computing the schwarzman College of

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,879
computing for organizing not just

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,719
today's event but the the whole week um

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,840
many of you may have come for the events

16
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,200
earlier this week and uh it's really

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,000
fantastic that we do this during

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,000
IAP uh today is focused on Quantum

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,520
Computing I'm going to start it off with

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
an intro to Quantum Computing uh some of

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,359
this is related to a course that we

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,120
teach online through mitx Pro which both

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,480
myself and um Ike Chang who is our

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,359
second speaker um put together a few

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,199
years ago it's been it's been quite

26
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,600
successful um if you'd like to learn

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,240
more about Quantum and you have a few

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,759
weeks uh let me know because this this

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,640
is a great way to continue what we're

30
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,400
going to talk about today through the

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,080
mitx pro platform so this morning is

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
going to be an intro to Quantum

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
Computing um I'll speak uh and then

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
Professor ik Chong uh will speak also

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
for an hour we'll break for

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,560
lunch and then this afternoon we have

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,600
some more focused um Topics in including

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,560
different Quantum Computing platforms um

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,240
and also you know state-of-the-art or

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,759
Cutting Edge research where are we today

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,719
and it will include both Quantum

42
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:49,439
Computing um but also um security so uh

43
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:53,040
Professor venod uh V kathan will talk

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,680
about how do we mitigate or combat the

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,039
threat that quantum computers pose to us

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,000
um that's his expertise um Professor

47
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,280
Aram herrow will talk about um

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,439
algorithms um yena Naros will talk about

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,319
um integrated photonics and then Kevin

50
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,879
O'Brien I see that the the list here is

51
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:15,599
uh um oh no okay never mind the the

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,360
titles are on the top yeah so arum will

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,920
talk about Quantum algorithms yena will

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
talk about integrated photonics for

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,480
trapped ions and then Kevin O'Brien will

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,800
talk about electronic circuits that

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,280
behave Quantum mechanically we'll take a

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,440
short break then and after that we'll

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,599
have a panel discussion but really what

60
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,440
I'd like to do with that panel

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,400
discussion is really open it up to

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,800
questions and have it be a free flow uh

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,480
Q&A so with that if there are no

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,720
questions uh why don't we get

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,560
started good so so I'm going to start it

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,200
off with Quantum engineering of um

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
superc conducted cubits or Quantum

68
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,040
Computing uh more

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,800
generally um we often call Quantum

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,159
Computing Quantum 2.0 why do we call it

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,760
2.0 well there was a 1.0 what you see

72
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,080
here is a picture from the solv

73
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,480
conference in

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,400
1927 you probably recognize a lot of

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,599
these folks um many of them won Nobel

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,799
prizes uh either they had already run

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,599
won it or they were about to in fact one

78
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,760
person here Madame Marie C uh won it

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,599
twice this is what we call the first

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,120
Quantum Revolution Quantum 1.0 it's when

81
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,640
we first understood that nature around

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,080
us is not classical it's fundamentally

83
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,360
quantum mechanical and in certain limits

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
it behaves classical and that's

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,799
generally what we

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,560
observe now based on that we were able

87
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,040
to um develop several Technologies which

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,000
are manifestly classical but we could

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,159
not have understood them without quantum

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,400
mechanics as a foundation and I like to

91
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,000
start here I guess I'm an electrical

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
engineer so I would like to start here

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,920
with a history of classical electronic

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
Computing how did we get to these

95
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,040
fantastic computers we have today well

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,120
it took well over a 100 Years of

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,360
development we started with the vacuum

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,319
tube that was 1906 three terminal device

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,400
um it was used for radio transceivers

100
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,519
for almost four decades 40 years before

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,680
it found its use in a computer called

102
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,040
eniac uh developed at the University of

103
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,400
Pennsylvania a vacuum tube based

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
computer of course to get closer to

105
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,519
where we are today we needed the

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,639
transistor that's Bell labs in 47 and by

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,840
the mid-50s we had fully transistor

108
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,960
based computers this one called tx0 or

109
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,080
tixo it didn't look like the computers

110
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,800
we have today and the sense that those

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,560
transistors were basically soldered

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,120
together okay and the memory was

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,320
completely different a magnetic core

114
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,520
type memory to get closer even still to

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,520
where we are we needed integrated

116
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,360
circuits that was the late 50s in

117
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,360
geranium and then in Silicon and of

118
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,280
course it wasn't until the 70s that we

119
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,400
finally saw something that you would

120
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,840
look at and say oh yeah that's an

121
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,840
integrated circuit that's a chip this is

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,320
the Intel 404 a 4bit processor with only

123
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,160
2,000 transistors revolutionary at the

124
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,240
time to get closer still I remember

125
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,360
using Pentium Pros in the mid 90s

126
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,800
millions of transistors on a single chip

127
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,080
that was fantastic but remember that was

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,639
already 30 years ago and here we are

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,440
today with uh wonderful computers um

130
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:21,000
gpus CPUs xus all kinds of processing

131
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,680
units 3D integrated right and the system

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,080
on the chip now has 100 billion

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,560
transistors and that's fantastic and

134
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,680
these these computers today are amazing

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
but we can't forget that those amazing

136
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,759
computers their progyny is well over 100

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,680
years old okay why do I talk about this

138
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,560
in so much detail well because Quantum

139
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,759
Computing is nent in the 80s people like

140
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,600
Richard feeman said look if you want to

141
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,280
simulate or emulate a Quantum system you

142
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,639
should use another quantum system to do

143
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,240
it because it's really hard on classical

144
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,720
computers to keep track of all of those

145
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,000
degrees of freedom that was true in the

146
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,440
80s still true

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,919
today now people thought about this

148
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,840
and it wasn't until maybe 15 years later

149
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,319
that we started to see the algorithms

150
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,120
that one would imagine using or running

151
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,919
on a quantum computer when we could

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,520
build it no Hardware at this point um

153
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,440
and you know calling out to Peter Shore

154
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,479
and his algorithm which attacks uh

155
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,880
public key crypto systems we'll hear a

156
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,000
lot about that today but of course if

157
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,080
that were the only application it would

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,680
not drive commercialization we would

159
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,720
need it of course we care a lot about

160
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,880
security but to drive commercialization

161
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,440
we need algorithms we'll talk about

162
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,280
algorithms throughout the day today but

163
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,720
algorithms that are commercially viable

164
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,280
and relevant right people will pay money

165
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,800
to run and we'll talk about some of

166
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,120
those algorithms and many of them had

167
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,280
their seeds in the

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,800
mid90s and 30 years later here we are

169
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,479
today we have um small scale quantum

170
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,120
computers maybe 100 cubits to 1,000

171
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,120
cubits um they're real they work but

172
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,879
they're too small to be commercially

173
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,039
viable you know usually when people

174
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,440
think commercially viable they're like

175
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,960
okay when am I going to have a quantum

176
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,479
computer that tells me um the the

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,759
formula for um a pharmaceutical drug or

178
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,759
something like that that is going to

179
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,759
take a very large error corrected

180
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,680
quantum computer and we'll talk we'll

181
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,879
talk more about that throughout the day

182
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,560
but the quantum computers we have today

183
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,960
you can run algorithms on them they're

184
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,000
just small and you can prove that those

185
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,000
algorithms work and it also gives you

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,120
insight into how large a hardware

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,759
quantum computer am I waiting for for

188
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,599
this to be commercially

189
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,960
viable so the takeaway message here is

190
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,599
that Quantum Computing is real it's

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
transitioning for from what you might

192
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,440
call a scientific curiosity to a

193
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,919
technical reality that's happening right

194
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,360
now as Engineers we know that advancing

195
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,280
from some fundamental Discovery to a

196
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,039
useful machine it takes a Time takes a

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,319
lot of Engineering Systems right we have

198
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,520
to have that type of thinking we're

199
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,120
there now um the other thing is you must

200
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,879
be in the game to play and what I mean

201
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
by that is the companies that are making

202
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,319
these fantastic you know billion plus

203
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,280
transistor chips they didn't wait for

204
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
somebody in 2010 to figure out how to do

205
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,639
it and then just jump in and start

206
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,919
producing them right there's a lot of

207
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,680
Trade Secrets right this is hardware

208
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,560
it's hard tech and you got to be in it

209
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,720
from the beginning

210
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,400
okay a lot of activity going on

211
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,560
worldwide and I won't read through this

212
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,879
whole chart here but but the point is is

213
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,680
that funding for Quantum Computing

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,720
started largely with governments driven

215
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,839
primarily by the security concern of

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
Shores algorithm um but since then I

217
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
would say within the last 10 years

218
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,959
there's been a tremendous push uh

219
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
towards commercialization and this is

220
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,200
just this is not an exhaustive list it's

221
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,480
just what I could fit on the chart and a

222
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,720
few of these companies are trying to

223
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,480
build quantum computers or Quantum

224
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,959
sensors but most of them are trying to

225
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,519
figure out how quantum's going to affect

226
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,640
their bottom line in the future and then

227
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,519
some of them are the picks and the

228
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,839
shovels that are needed to make Quantum

229
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,760
Computing a reality so this

230
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,360
commercialization ation uh and ecosystem

231
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,959
is happening right

232
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,480
now so what are cubits like what is the

233
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,440
fundamental logic element of a quantum

234
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,160
computer well they come in two flavors

235
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,920
one flavor is the natural atoms that we

236
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,440
have in our periodic table of elements

237
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,600
you can see them here um and we know

238
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,279
that depending on the number of protons

239
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,640
the number of neutrons and the number of

240
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,000
electrons we form these uh bore type

241
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,920
atoms and each element has different

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,760
properties depending on those numbers

243
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,360
okay and some of them we can pick out

244
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,160
and use uh to be our Cubit and in

245
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,079
particular we look for those that have

246
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,320
energy levels such that we can call one

247
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,120
of them zero and one of them one okay

248
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
we'll talk more detail about that but

249
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,000
these are the natural uh

250
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,920
atoms another way we can do it is we can

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,200
build electronic circuits and the

252
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,480
electronic circuits have inductors

253
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,079
capacitors and Joseph's injunctions and

254
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
depending on their parameter values and

255
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,720
the number of elements we have and the

256
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,560
way that we put them together we can

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,040
form circuits that have properties that

258
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,200
mimic or look like atoms but of course

259
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,440
at the end of the day it's just an

260
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,240
electrical circuit it looks like an atom

261
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,560
in the sense that it has discretized

262
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,279
energy levels such as shown here with a

263
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,200
zero and a one we can

264
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,519
identify and in fact there is a you

265
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,640
could think of it as a mlay of table of

266
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,800
these types of circuits each one having

267
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,320
different properties um that we can

268
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,200
design as electrical engineers right so

269
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,160
so so these are the two general families

270
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
of cubits again we'll talk more about

271
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,160
them in detail natural atoms and then

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
synthetic or artificial

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,480
atoms okay so with that let's talk about

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,880
how Quantum Computing Works um we'll

275
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
then talk a little bit about superc

276
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,399
conducting cubits and Engineering

277
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,560
Quantum

278
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,920
systems okay so how is a quantum

279
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,680
computer different than a classical

280
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,680
computer I I often use this because I of

281
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,800
course I was trained on classical

282
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,320
computers um

283
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,880
classical computers of course are based

284
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,120
on bits transistor is the voltage there

285
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,120
or not um but it could be any two-state

286
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,040
system um the states are zero or one

287
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,600
that's it they're discreet transistors

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,680
are almost perfect we've really

289
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,480
optimized them well and the error rate

290
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,160
is something like one part and 10 to the

291
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,839
20 they almost never fail if we set it

292
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,320
in one we're going to measure it in one

293
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,680
if we set it in zero we'll measure it in

294
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,440
zero if something unfortunate happens

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,920
right now almost certainly it's the soft

296
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,079
Ware not the

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,959
hardware cubits are quantum bits we

298
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,160
pronounce it Cubit and we spell it this

299
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,360
way uh and it's really a quantum

300
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,959
mechanical two-l system or two-state

301
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,000
system and the way that we think about

302
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,320
it is with something called The Block

303
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,320
sphere uh but you can think of it as the

304
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,560
planet Earth and if you're at the North

305
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,920
Pole you're in state zero a classical

306
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,920
state if you're at the South Pole you're

307
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,279
in state one also a classical State and

308
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,399
so transistors classical transistors

309
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,360
they only live at the North and the

310
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,959
South

311
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,959
Pole but cubits like people can be

312
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,079
anywhere on the surface of the planet

313
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,279
Earth and when you're anywhere other

314
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,399
than the North or the South Pole you're

315
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,279
in a Quantum superposition of States

316
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,279
zero and one

317
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,880
simultaneously now you can have waiting

318
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,440
coefficients if you're on the equator

319
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,959
the waiting coefficients are equal I

320
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,000
mean equal superposition of 0o and one

321
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,519
and if I'm away from the equator then

322
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm not I'm more weighted towards one

323
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,959
than the other but it is a Quantum

324
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,839
superposition

325
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,480
right and this is just like you're

326
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,079
standing at a single place on Earth this

327
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,480
is not a mixture of two classical States

328
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,480
this is a single state that has a

329
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,680
property that has aspects of zero and

330
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,760
one simultaneously and that that's weird

331
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,880
all right it's not classical

332
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,279
superposition one consequence is that

333
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,920
measurement is probabilistic if you're

334
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,760
on the equator let's say you go to a

335
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,720
point on the equator and I make a

336
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,480
measurement that gives me classical

337
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,160
information out so you need to snap

338
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,720
immediately to the North Pole or to the

339
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,399
South Pole which one it's random it's

340
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,120
one of the purest forms of Randomness we

341
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,680
know quantum mechanics that provides us

342
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,800
if I go back to the same place on the

343
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,720
earth and I measure again just like

344
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,600
flipping a coin 50/50 I'm going to snap

345
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,480
to the North Pole or to the South Pole

346
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,279
instantly because I get that information

347
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,959
out okay so what this means is that

348
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,040
quantum computers rely on encoding

349
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,399
information in a fundamentally different

350
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,720
way than classical computers do so one

351
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,480
consequence of this is um shown here so

352
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,199
a classical computer with n Bits a

353
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,839
number n Bits can form um an

354
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,920
exponentially large number of states 2

355
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,079
to the nth power but it only can

356
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,639
represent one of them at a time so it

357
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,680
could be that all the uh transistors

358
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,759
here are in zero could be they're all in

359
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,519
one and all permutations in between with

360
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,639
three bits there are eight of those two

361
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,959
to the thir

362
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,480
power and what that means is if for some

363
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,519
reason I wanted to calculate a function

364
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,920
with each of these as an input I

365
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,199
basically have two options the first

366
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,079
thing I can do is I could take one

367
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:13,720
computer and then serially in time put

368
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,720
in 000000 get the function of that out

369
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,880
put in 001 get its function out and I do

370
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,440
that an exponentially large number of

371
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,440
times the other thing I could do is I

372
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,600
could buy a large number of computers

373
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,240
and I could run them as Illustrated here

374
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
in parallel but either way if I have an

375
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,959
exponentially large number of inputs I

376
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,759
need either exponential time or

377
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:38,880
exponential Hardware to do this

378
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,160
task quantum computers you can have n

379
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,000
cubits and again there will be two to

380
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,639
the end components or classical States

381
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,839
but the quantum computer can put all of

382
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,000
them into a single Quantum superposition

383
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,079
state with waiting

384
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,079
coefficients and you can think of it as

385
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,399
this massive superposition State going

386
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,079
into the quantum computer computer and

387
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,360
then a massive superposition State

388
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:05,639
coming out we haven't measured anything

389
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,320
yet we didn't get any information yet

390
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,440
okay now what happens in here and we'll

391
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,639
see it Illustrated in a moment is

392
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,519
something called Quantum parallelism and

393
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
Quantum interference and this underpins

394
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,000
or is the foundation for the power of a

395
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,920
quantum

396
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,199
computer so how do we take advantage of

397
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,079
this so let's go into a little bit more

398
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,920
detailed to see how Quantum parallelism

399
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,319
and Quantum interference work we're

400
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,079
going to start with this Quantum two

401
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:33,199
level system this is an electron spin uh

402
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,240
in a magnetic field and when an electron

403
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,800
spin is in a magnetic field it has

404
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,079
different energy depending on whether

405
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,279
the spin is aligned or anti-aligned with

406
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:43,480
the field okay so those are our two

407
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,079
states spin up spin down they have

408
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,519
different energies we'll call that e01

409
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,920
let's call spin up state zero and spin

410
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
down state

411
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,959
one so again if you're at the North Pole

412
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,000
or the South Pole you're in a classical

413
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,160
state so when when this is pointed

414
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,600
towards the North Pole here this is just

415
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,680
the classical zero uh when we're pointed

416
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,560
to the South Pole that's classical one

417
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,160
but we know as we said that anywhere

418
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,120
other than the North Pole we can form

419
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,199
superposition states of zero and one

420
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,440
simultaneously with waiting coefficients

421
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,880
Alpha and beta constrained in this way

422
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,120
so that the unit Vector is

423
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,279
preserved now just like on Earth we have

424
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,199
latitude and longitude we can represent

425
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,120
this state using phases um Theta and fi

426
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,720
and we could write this state in this

427
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,079
way

428
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,360
so at the North Pole Theta is zero at

429
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,360
the South Pole Theta is pi and this is

430
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,000
like a latitude and then the longitude

431
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,800
is where we are um along the Equator

432
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,199
okay so so on the equator you could see

433
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,880
that we are in equal superposition of0

434
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,600
and one simultaneously meaning the

435
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,279
magnitude of the coefficients that sit

436
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,360
there is equal it's one/ Square < TK of

437
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,079
two um but we also have this phase in

438
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,880
terms of where am I pointing on the

439
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,000
equator that's another phase that we

440
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,959
have all right so if you have these

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,720
three spins you could just treat them

442
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,160
classically you can say I'm never going

443
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,160
to put them in superp position I'm just

444
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,160
going to use them as classical bits and

445
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,679
you could form a state Register which I

446
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,679
just list here all the possible

447
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,799
permutations and from running from 0000

448
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,280
to 111 and you could do classical

449
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,400
computation this

450
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,559
way alternatively Quantum mechanically

451
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,480
what we would do is we would put all of

452
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,799
these um classical States into a single

453
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,720
superposition State sigh with waiting

454
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,400
coefficients C1 through C8 you could

455
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,200
write it this way it looks more digital

456
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,840
but of course we're representing it with

457
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,280
spins and we'll just note here that it

458
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,840
looks like we have eight numbers but

459
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,679
actually those are complex number so to

460
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,400
represent this state takes uh twice that

461
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,320
number 16 okay so we can now make this a

462
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,559
Quantum State register with coefficients

463
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,360
C1 through

464
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,799
C8 and we can now see how a computation

465
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,480
might un fold and it relies heavily on

466
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,280
these two quantum mechanical phenomena

467
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,799
called parallelism and interference so

468
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,480
let's let's just get an intuitive feel

469
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:12,679
for what that is so we're going to start

470
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,400
with these um three spins and let's just

471
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,720
focus on the first one we're going to

472
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,000
drive it with a pulse and this pulse has

473
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,960
the right area um to do what's called a

474
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,559
p pulse okay what does that mean well if

475
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,360
we're pointed towards the North Pole a

476
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,440
pi pulse will flip that spin to the

477
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,159
South Pole it rotates by an angle of Pi

478
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Pi if the spin were pointed at the South

479
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:38,159
Pole it would rotate it back up to the

480
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,159
North Pole also PI right and so what we

481
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,640
see is that if we were to apply this

482
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,280
pulse onto this first spin what we what

483
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,280
we see is that we're going to shuttle

484
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,799
the coefficients around and let's see

485
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,120
how that happens so the state Register

486
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,840
before and after the pulse is shown here

487
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,400
um for spin ups that come in with these

488
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,520
coefficients you can see the other two

489
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,880
spins have different permutation but

490
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,559
these four um portions or aspect of the

491
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
superposition all have a spin up and

492
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,360
when we apply this pulse we are going to

493
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,520
flip it to spin down and the

494
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,000
coefficients follow

495
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,640
along now instead in that superposition

496
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,840
State I should where the spin was down

497
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,320
those aspects are going to flip to up

498
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,880
and the coefficients follow along so

499
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,960
what did we just do this is amazing we

500
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,520
applied one pulse we applied it to one

501
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,919
Spin and we just shuttled two to the N

502
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,840
coefficients in our state space

503
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,400
simultaneously okay that's called

504
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,919
Quantum

505
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,000
parallelism

506
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,400
now Quantum interference we can look at

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,159
and we'll we'll now apply this pulse to

508
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,559
uh the spin on atom three and if you

509
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:51,840
notice it's basically half of the area

510
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,640
which means it's only going to rotate

511
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,120
half as far and let me just tell you how

512
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,000
it works so we have before the pulse and

513
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,600
after the pulse if the spin is pointed

514
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,080
at the North Pole and we rotate it

515
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,120
around this axis pointed to the right by

516
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,240
pi/ 2 it's going to be on the

517
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,440
equator and I'm just going to say that

518
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,000
that's a plus Direction Let's just say

519
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,640
that for the

520
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,720
moment um and what that means is a spin

521
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:22,080
up is going to go to a superposition of

522
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,720
up plus down equal superposition it's on

523
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,159
the equator and it comes with a plus

524
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,919
sign now I'm not worried about

525
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,360
normalization here for those who are

526
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:30,600
experts in quantum mechanics there is a

527
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,840
normal Iz ation but we don't need it for

528
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,880
this uh

529
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,640
illustration now what happens to this

530
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,400
spin right here that happens to be spin

531
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,799
up in uh with the coefficient C5 well

532
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,679
it's going to go to up plus down so it

533
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:48,240
now splits between two aspects and the

534
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,120
coefficient C5 follows along and it it's

535
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,039
Plus for both of them again without the

536
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,480
normalization I'm not worried about

537
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,760
that now instead for the portion of the

538
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,640
superposition state where the spin is is

539
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,440
down let's just look at this one case um

540
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,720
if you start at the South Pole and you

541
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,280
rotate in the same direction you'll find

542
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,200
that you go up to the equator but now

543
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,520
you're pointed in the opposite side of

544
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,279
the earth and so we're going to say this

545
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,120
comes in with a minus sign okay so this

546
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,360
spin down now goes to up and down but it

547
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,760
comes in with a minus sign which means

548
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,039
the coefficient C6 follows in the same

549
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,520
way plus C6 where it's up minus C6 where

550
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:33,080
it's down and now what we see is that

551
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,279
for example if C5 and C6 were equal they

552
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,600
need not be but let's just presume that

553
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:41,840
it's true then for this first up up up

554
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,559
portion of the state they add together

555
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,120
constructively it gets

556
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:50,240
bigger and for this portion C5 minus C6

557
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,080
they destructively interfere in fact if

558
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,480
they're equal goes to zero so there's no

559
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,760
more waiting on this aspect of the

560
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,000
superposition State this is what we mean

561
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,120
when we say quum

562
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,320
interference we're enhancing or

563
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,559
suppressing

564
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,120
coefficients and in fact this is also an

565
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,080
example of quantum parallelism because

566
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,120
it happens on the entire State space

567
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,360
simultaneously right so again to

568
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,799
emphasize we applied one pulse we

569
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,400
applied it to one Spin and all of this

570
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,279
happened at the same

571
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,279
time okay that that underpins the power

572
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,400
of a quantum

573
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:25,840
computer okay so how do we take

574
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,720
advantage of this and actually Implement

575
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,559
and run algorithms well it almost at

576
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,640
least conceptually is the same as a

577
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,320
classical computer we know on a

578
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,159
conventional computer we have classical

579
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,720
Boolean logic gates and I won't read

580
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,640
through the whole thing but we have a

581
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,559
not gate we have an and gate an or gate

582
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,440
with these truth tables shown here and

583
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,480
we know that we can form a universal set

584
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,440
um of gates Universal Gat set for

585
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,080
Boolean logic not with just one

586
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,000
combination but with several different

587
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,080
combinations the nangate the Norgate

588
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,799
there are many different combinations

589
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,679
of gates just a handful of them that

590
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,360
would enable us to run any Boolean logic

591
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,679
algorithm it's called a universal gate

592
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,679
set it does require at least one two bit

593
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:14,120
gate Quantum is basically the same just

594
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,960
in the quantum mechanical realm we have

595
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,039
Gates and those Gates represent

596
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,520
rotations around the planet Earth so for

597
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,600
example an xgate is a rotation around

598
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,320
the x-axis we can Define one of these as

599
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,640
X the Y gate is a rotation around the Y

600
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,760
AIS these are all single Cubit Gates we

601
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,919
also have a z

602
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,679
rotation and we have what are called two

603
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,679
Cubit Gates where the state of one of

604
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,360
the cubits determines what happens to

605
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,520
the second Cubit but it only involves

606
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,720
two cubits uh one example is controlled

607
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,440
knot the other is controlled phase and

608
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,000
with just a handful of these single and

609
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,640
two cubic Gates we can form a universal

610
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,600
gate set that runs any arbitrary Quantum

611
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,320
logic and again it's not unique there

612
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,320
are many combinations uh that satisfy

613
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,200
this universality

614
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,520
um one thing to point out is quantum

615
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,159
gates are by definition reversible of

616
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,400
course we do have examples in classical

617
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,600
Electronics which are reversible as well

618
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,279
um and it also requires at least one two

619
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,159
Cubit gate and it has to be what's

620
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,720
called an entangling gate I'll show an

621
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,679
example in just a

622
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,080
moment so let's let's look at an example

623
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,640
of a single Cubit operation and and the

624
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,760
analogue I'm going to draw here is to

625
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,760
the classical knot gate so a notot gate

626
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,159
if you put in a zero you get a one if

627
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,120
you put in a one you get a zero and the

628
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,159
quantum analog to this is called the

629
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,240
xgate where I put in a Quantum state

630
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,760
zero and I get a one or I put in a one

631
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,799
and I get a

632
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,279
zero this is what it looks like now what

633
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,640
you're seeing here on the left is the

634
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,320
planet Earth um the state is in blue it

635
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,320
starts at the North Pole and rotates to

636
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,799
the South Pole it's rotating around the

637
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,919
x-axis you can see this red uh Arrow

638
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,480
come in and out and that red arrow is

639
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,399
representing the envelope of the pulse

640
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,640
that I'm applying

641
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,559
to do this operation and that this pulse

642
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,600
envelope is tuned properly so the area

643
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,399
is exactly right to go from the North

644
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,520
Pole to the South Pole now as I'm

645
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:12,360
showing it here this is just a classical

646
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,200
implementation because I start at the

647
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,720
North Pole I end at the South Pole those

648
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,880
are classical

649
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,320
States but of course you need not start

650
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,720
at the North or South Pole you could be

651
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,440
anywhere on the surface of the planet

652
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,360
Earth and this gate will do exactly the

653
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,320
same thing it rotates by an angle Pi

654
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,320
around the x-axis and so here I started

655
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,240
in a superp position State I rotate

656
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,399
around the x-axis I end in a

657
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,559
superposition State and what this xgate

658
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:41,000
does is it swaps the coefficients Alpha

659
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,799
0 plus beta 1 becomes beta 0 plus alpha

660
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,840
1 okay this is just one example of the

661
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:50,200
single Cubit gate that we have okay

662
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,039
let's look at a two Cubit gate this is

663
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,000
the two Cubit controlled knot it's

664
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:58,520
classical analog is the exclusive orgate

665
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,200
now the exclusive orgate um has you can

666
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,559
think of it in this way as having a

667
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,919
control bit and a Target bit X and Y the

668
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:09,279
truth table is here and when the control

669
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,520
bit X is in zero the value of y is just

670
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,200
passed to the output

671
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,559
unchanged but when the control bit is

672
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,880
one we know that the value of y should

673
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:21,600
be flipped we do a not gate on Y and

674
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,320
that becomes the output you can think of

675
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,039
exclusive or this

676
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,720
way and the quantum version is exactly

677
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,480
the same you have two cubits one is the

678
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,399
control Cubit X and then there's a

679
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,840
Target Cubit y this symbolism is how we

680
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,200
represent the controlled knot and the

681
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,760
truth table aside from using this funny

682
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,000
notation called durac notation which

683
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,919
just says I'm talking about quantum

684
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,679
mechanical stuff it's exactly the same

685
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,840
the truth table is the same and so what

686
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,039
it means is that a rotation or an

687
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,000
operation on Cubit y the target depends

688
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,440
on the state of Cubit X the

689
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,279
control now quantum mechanics follows

690
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,279
linear algebra and we can just figure

691
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,679
out for ourselves how this works for a

692
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,840
particularly interesting input state

693
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,679
where the control Cubit is 0 plus one

694
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,600
it's an equal superp position that's the

695
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,880
uh control Cubit X and the target Cubit

696
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:19,640
is uh Y and it's in state zero classical

697
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,399
state so let's take this one at a time

698
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,240
so when the control Cubit is zero we

699
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,039
know that we shouldn't change the target

700
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,799
Cubit so it comes down here and you get

701
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,720
0x 0 y

702
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,399
but when the control cuit is one we're

703
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,880
supposed to flip the Y bit and so that

704
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:37,600
flips to one and now we see something

705
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,360
very interesting here this is called an

706
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,000
entangling gate precisely for this

707
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,720
reason which is that even though when I

708
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,279
started I could look at something which

709
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,600
was entirely x-like um tensor product

710
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,960
with something that's entirely y like

711
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,919
once I do this gate I can't do that

712
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,640
anymore you can see that X and Y are

713
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,080
intimately um tied to each other

714
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,039
and it's they're tied to each other in a

715
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
way that's called quantum entanglement I

716
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,880
can't Factor it anymore now this isn't

717
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,720
proof that it's entanglement you'd have

718
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,640
to look at this in different bases but

719
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,679
in fact this is an entangled State

720
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,399
called a bell

721
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,640
state so this is just one example but

722
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,720
Universal gate based Quantum computation

723
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,039
um is achievable with just a small set

724
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,960
of these single and two cubic Gates this

725
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,039
is how it

726
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,279
works so now let's think about an

727
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:31,000
algorithm what does it mean to write an

728
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,200
algorithm of course you'll use some

729
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,360
sequence of these single and two cubic

730
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,919
Gates and often usually um the quantum

731
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,519
computer will start in an equal

732
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,320
superposition state of all of these uh 2

733
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,320
to the N

734
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,039
aspects and the way that I think about

735
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,919
it is that this is an equal

736
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,200
superposition of all the possible

737
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,880
answers right I'm starting with this

738
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,120
equal each answer is equally likely

739
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,440
because I know when I make a measurement

740
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,080
I'm only going to get one answer right

741
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,720
we'll see that in just a moment and so

742
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,000
what the algorithm designer does is

743
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,080
choose as a sequence of single Cubit and

744
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,200
two Cubit operations so of course here's

745
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,279
an example where you have a single Cubit

746
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,880
operation on Cubit 3 and as we talked

747
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,039
about it's one pulse on one cubit but it

748
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,279
will change the coefficients um of 2 to

749
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,000
the N components simultaneously and it

750
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,640
does that through Quantum parallelism

751
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,440
and Quantum interference which changes

752
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,480
the co efficients now that sit in front

753
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,559
of this superposition state they're no

754
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,399
longer all

755
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:38,919
equal sometimes we'll have couple Cubit

756
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,880
operations where the state of one cubit

757
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:44,200
tells me what to do on the second

758
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,760
Cubit that follows Quantum interference

759
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,360
or followed by Quantum interference it's

760
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,640
also massively parallelized and so by

761
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,760
the end of the computation the goal of

762
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,200
the algorithm designer is to ensure that

763
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,919
the right answer is weighted by a

764
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,399
coefficient that's one or close to one

765
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,320
and all of the other answers that are

766
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:06,799
wrong have been suppressed to

767
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,000
zero and that's important because we

768
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,919
know when we make a measurement we're

769
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,760
going to project and the probability

770
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,640
that we get any one of these results

771
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,440
goes as the magnitude squared of the

772
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,720
coefficient remember if you were on the

773
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,240
equator it was equally weighted and it

774
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,039
was 50/50 whether you're going to go

775
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,640
zero or one you don't want that in

776
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,960
algorithm in an algorithm you want to

777
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,000
get the right answer 100% of the time

778
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,360
ideally and so we started with an equal

779
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,640
superposition of all possible answers

780
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,200
through the course of applying Gates we

781
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,559
suppressed all of the wrong answers we

782
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
enhanced the right one and then when we

783
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,480
make a measurement with high probability

784
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,080
that's what we get so it's a mistaken

785
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,320
it's often said and it's a not really

786
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,600
true that quantum computers will

787
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,960
calculate the output to all of these

788
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,799
inputs that's not what's happening in

789
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,360
the quantum computer right that that

790
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,120
would be you know mistaken concept what

791
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,320
it's doing is it's suppressing all the

792
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,760
wrong answers and enhancing the right

793
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,320
answer so that at the end you get the

794
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,519
right answer but you're not going to get

795
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,519
two to the end outputs you're going to

796
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,519
get one output that's very

797
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,720
important it'd be great if we could do

798
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,559
that but we

799
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,039
can't okay so there are many algorithms

800
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,760
that have been developed and um that

801
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,519
support this and I just showed pictures

802
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,200
of my colleagues here uh at MIT who do

803
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,720
work on either Quantum algorithms or

804
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Quantum software but and and I won't

805
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,559
read this whole chart but let me say

806
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,799
that the categories of algorithm are

807
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:32,679
shown here on the left um Quantum

808
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:35,039
simulation is probably the you know

809
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,279
killer commercial app I would say um

810
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,960
simulating materials or chemistries for

811
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,639
example Pharma um I also showed the

812
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,080
classical time and the quantum time here

813
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:47,159
um in general the classical time is

814
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,559
exponential in the size of the system um

815
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,559
the quantum time is uh

816
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,240
polinomial factoring of course Peter

817
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,360
shor's algorithm sampling solutions to

818
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,279
linear systems of equations this is uh

819
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,080
Aram Aram Harrow and Seth Lloyd the

820
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,240
Harum Haro hium Lloyd algorithm um

821
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,679
optimization a lot of work by folks like

822
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,039
Eddie fary on this one

823
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,760
here they're clearly everybody's trying

824
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,919
to optimize something so there's clearly

825
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,559
a commercial need for it but the degree

826
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,080
to which quantum computers can help us

827
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,360
with optimization uh depends a lot on

828
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,519
the optimization problem okay do you

829
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,080
need the exact solution is a high

830
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,519
quality solution good enough okay that's

831
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,639
why there's a question mark here and uh

832
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,679
of course Grover's search algorithm of

833
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:33,919
unsorted data and that's a quadratic

834
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,720
Improvement not an exponential

835
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,799
one

836
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,720
so what are the ingredients for

837
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:42,360
commercial Quantum advantage and um I

838
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,519
borrowed this chart from Ike it's a

839
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,360
fantastic chart so first there better be

840
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,720
no fast classical algorithm if we know

841
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,960
how to do it on one of these computers

842
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,799
we should absolutely do it they're

843
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,039
fantastic so just solve that so first

844
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:56,840
off no fast classical algorithm for my

845
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,399
problem second is we need to know how to

846
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,919
solve it on a Quantum comp computer

847
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,919
there are many problems where there's no

848
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,000
fast classical algorithm and I have no

849
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,399
idea how to do it on a quantum computer

850
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,679
okay so so you need a fast Quantum

851
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,240
algorithm and then third ideally you'd

852
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,360
like it to be a useful meaning a

853
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,360
commercial problem there are many

854
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,480
examples of problems which are

855
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,720
instructive and we learn from them like

856
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,120
deuts josa right as an example where you

857
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,600
can prove that there's an exponential

858
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,559
speed up but it's for a problem that's

859
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,320
not commercially relevant and what we

860
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,919
would like is that this over La region

861
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,200
is The Sweet Spot we of course want to

862
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,279
make this larger and and that's a charge

863
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,360
to everyone here um especially students

864
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,279
and post dos that you know this is what

865
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,760
we need to do if quantum computers are

866
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:45,880
going to be um useful one day is

867
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,440
increase the the overlap

868
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,279
area we've already alluded to it but

869
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,639
there are two types of quantum advantage

870
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,080
that we have in quantum computers and

871
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,080
and you can think of them in the

872
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,240
following way the size of the system or

873
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,399
the time to solution

874
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,159
energy needed to run that quantum

875
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:07,519
computer is proportional to a polinomial

876
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,800
factor in the size of the system n uh

877
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,879
and an exponential factor in the size of

878
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,399
the system

879
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,040
n so algorithms like Grover's algorithm

880
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,079
improve the preactor we call this a

881
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,359
polinomial Improvement for example n

882
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,960
goes to square root of n okay that's a

883
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:25,320
big Improvement especially for large n

884
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,720
but it pales in comparison to an

885
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,240
exponential Improvement for example two

886
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,960
to the nth power going to n cubed n

887
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,359
comes downstairs that that's an amazing

888
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,320
Improvement and we don't often

889
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:40,079
experience it in our everyday lives okay

890
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,839
so here's here's an

891
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,399
example um of exponential growth that

892
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:48,560
I'd like to highlight um and and what

893
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,399
we're talking about here is I have a

894
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,159
quantum computer and I want to simulate

895
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,399
that quantum computer using a

896
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,320
conventional classical computer how much

897
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,680
memory would I need to store all of

898
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,760
those coefficients in my superposition

899
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,680
state if you have 30 cuits that's 2 to

900
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,160
the 30th power you you can do that on a

901
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,079
laptop a beefy

902
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,119
laptop but just go to 50 not even twice

903
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,800
as many and now we need to have a super

904
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:18,240
computer to do it worth of memory go to

905
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,400
80 cubits and now somehow we need all of

906
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,960
the computers on Earth linked together

907
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,640
and leveraging all of their memory

908
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,240
hopefully quickly you maybe we need

909
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,800
photonic interconnects or something to

910
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,760
make this work and then it gets

911
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,359
ridiculous like double that to 160

912
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,359
cubits and now we would need all of the

913
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,960
Silicon atoms on Earth and every silicon

914
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:39,240
atom is representing one bit of the

915
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,079
memory and now go to 300 cubits just 10

916
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,359
times where we started and now you would

917
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,720
need all the atoms in the known universe

918
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,200
working together as memory elements for

919
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,839
this fictitious computer okay this

920
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,839
doesn't tell us how to build a quantum

921
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,720
computer but it does give us a concept

922
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:58,200
of what exponential scaling

923
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,960
means okay so it sounds great uh why

924
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,720
don't we have quantum computers right

925
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,680
now or why don't we have large fault

926
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,920
tolerant quantum computers right now and

927
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,480
it comes down to these two times one is

928
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,400
coherence time and the other is the gate

929
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,160
time so the coherence time is basically

930
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,640
the cubit's lifetime how long does it

931
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,000
remain quantum

932
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,800
mechanical now I'm including here

933
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,640
coherence due to noise but it can also

934
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,960
be due to control errors our classical

935
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,920
control we start out with a computer

936
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,160
quantum computer in a known state of all

937
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,119
those cubits call it sigh and as soon as

938
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,920
we start trying to run our algorithm it

939
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,480
starts interacting with its environment

940
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,640
there are temperature fluctuations

941
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,760
magnetic field fluctuations the subway

942
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,640
just left kendle station and you can see

943
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,079
it on your cubits everything they're

944
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,760
very sensitive and over time you can

945
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,640
think of this state of my computer

946
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,599
blurring and eventually it's lost what

947
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,839
does that mean well the cubits are still

948
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,599
there but in some notion of a high

949
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,680
dimensional State space I was trying to

950
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,160
go from this starting point to this end

951
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,560
point which is the answer to my problem

952
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,440
and as I'm marching along with my gate

953
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,119
operations to get there the noise is

954
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,240
actually taking me somewhere else and I

955
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,319
don't know where I went at the end it's

956
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,000
blurry because I don't know everything

957
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,920
that the noise is doing okay the time

958
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,839
frame over which this blurring happens

959
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,079
is called the coherence

960
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,560
time the second time we care about is

961
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,880
the gate time how long does it take me

962
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,560
to do an operation um a typical time and

963
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,560
the figure of Merit then is how many

964
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,920
operations can I do within this lifetime

965
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,480
that I have okay more operations being

966
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,800
better now one caveat here is that

967
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,200
people often

968
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,599
trumpet you know my my cubid has a

969
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,520
coherence time of 10 hours okay great

970
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,160
that that's not a bad thing but what's

971
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,480
important is how many operations can you

972
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,560
do in that 10 hours and and to give an

973
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,280
example a little bit of a ridiculous

974
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,920
example think of a nutrino you might

975
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,640
think a nutrino is a perfect Cubit

976
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,920
because it lasts

977
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,400
forever but it's not because I can't

978
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,280
operate I can't even detect it right and

979
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,200
so it's not just having long coherence

980
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,800
times often the technologies that have

981
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,599
long coherence times they do it or have

982
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,520
that long coherence time because they

983
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,760
don't listen to the noise if they don't

984
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,040
listen to the noise they don't listen to

985
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,079
me either when I'm trying to run the

986
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,119
algorithm and it turns out as we'll see

987
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,640
on the next chart these Technologies

988
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,480
almost independent of their coherence

989
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,400
times have roughly the same number of

990
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,400
operations uh that they can do within

991
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,440
that time okay so why don't we look at

992
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,640
that

993
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,839
chart so what we have here is the number

994
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,079
of operations before an error and on

995
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,280
this horizontal axis we have the gate

996
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:37,480
speed how think of that as the clock

997
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,119
speed now the number of operations

998
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,079
before an error you might think of as

999
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,400
the gate Fidelity so for a given gate

1000
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,839
what percentage of the time does it work

1001
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,800
so if I have one ER in 100 that's 99%

1002
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,359
one air in a th000 that's 99.9% Etc and

1003
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,520
of course you want to be fast and High

1004
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,319
Fidelity and so now we can take a look

1005
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,720
at different competing platforms so one

1006
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:03,119
is trapped ions which Ike works on along

1007
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,440
with John Chavi at Lincoln and rajie RAM

1008
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,680
here at MIT and you can see that trapped

1009
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,319
ions have very high fidelity uh single

1010
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,839
cubic Gates they're improving the two

1011
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:14,880
cubic gate um and they're trying to get

1012
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,079
faster to get into the upper right

1013
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,640
corner I work on superc conducting

1014
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,880
cubits along with Kevin O'Brien who'll

1015
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,480
speak this afternoon uh Terry Orlando

1016
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Jamie Kerman out at Lincoln and we are

1017
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,760
pretty fast um and we're trying to get

1018
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,119
higher Fidelity and so in some sense

1019
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,440
we're both equally far from you know

1020
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,680
this upper right

1021
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,440
corner neutral atoms have really started

1022
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,520
to shine in the last couple years this

1023
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,040
is where they are and some of our

1024
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,560
colleagues here vladon Wolf Gang and

1025
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,000
Martin working on this

1026
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,920
technology uh nitrogen vacancy centers

1027
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
or just generally speaking defects in

1028
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,720
Silicon or other

1029
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,560
substrates they can be used for

1030
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,680
computing uh they really shine as

1031
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,720
Quantum sensors magnetic field sensors

1032
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,760
for example and then my own group is

1033
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,720
starting to work also on Silicon Quantum

1034
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,520
dots which probably is the closest to a

1035
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,119
silicon transistor uh of the Cubit

1036
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,119
Technologies

1037
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:10,520
now these circles that just appeared

1038
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,079
here are giving us an indication of how

1039
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,040
fast we would actually be able to run a

1040
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,560
computer in practice because we need to

1041
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,839
do error correction if we're going to do

1042
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,040
sustained uh computations over long

1043
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,480
periods of time and so for the superc

1044
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,400
conducting cubits it's about a megahertz

1045
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,599
for some of the natural Atomic systems

1046
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,760
it's about a kilohertz

1047
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:32,079
and everybody's going to try to get

1048
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,160
faster it matters it really matters

1049
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,720
because all else being equal an

1050
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,440
important caveat but all else being

1051
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,359
equal if it takes me a day to run an

1052
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,680
algorithm on a superc conducting quantum

1053
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:44,400
computer at a megahertz it's going to

1054
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,839
take me a th days on something that runs

1055
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,119
a thousand times slower and even though

1056
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:50,079
both

1057
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,839
Technologies didn't take the age of the

1058
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,200
universe it's an exponential speed up

1059
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,440
over a classical computer it still

1060
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,680
matters how long it's going to take

1061
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,200
because I don't want to wait 3 years for

1062
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,160
the answer i' like the answer within a

1063
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,520
day and so the speed still matters in

1064
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,440
quantum

1065
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,280
computers okay lots of research going on

1066
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,720
I would say there's no clear winner and

1067
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,000
and also just like with conventional

1068
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,280
technology uh classical Computing

1069
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,839
technology it'll evolve over time right

1070
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,760
we started with bipolar Junction

1071
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,240
transistors uh we later had emitter

1072
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,880
coupled logic and you know we worked our

1073
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,520
way eventually to be at camos um it

1074
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,280
didn't you know in fact we started with

1075
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,280
vacuum tubes before that the technology

1076
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,040
will evolve and change over time

1077
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,839
okay

1078
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,040
um let me check the time I'm probably

1079
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,880
speaking a little too slowly yeah so let

1080
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,160
me talk a little bit about

1081
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,960
superconducting cubits these are

1082
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,680
artificial atoms we build them um from

1083
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,960
circuit elements like inductors and

1084
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,440
capacitors this in fact is a Quantum

1085
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,720
circuit element you probably recognize

1086
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,319
it it's the LC oscillator and one

1087
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,440
property of an LC oscillator is that

1088
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:58,079
it's harmonic which means that its

1089
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,880
potential is quadratic

1090
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,599
and at room temperature you don't see

1091
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,119
these discrete energy levels because

1092
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,599
they're separated by the resonance

1093
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,119
frequency 1ot of

1094
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,079
LC um but if you cool it down to a low

1095
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:13,680
enough temperature where the energy

1096
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,119
scale of the temperature KT is much less

1097
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,640
than the energy scale H bar Omega which

1098
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,640
is the separation here you you will see

1099
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,400
discretized energy levels for this

1100
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,400
circuit I think that's amazing uh as an

1101
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,440
electrical engineer um it's a great

1102
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,680
circuit it is Quant mechanical but it

1103
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,440
has this one issue is that if I want to

1104
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,960
make a cubit from it with a zero and a

1105
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,079
one um I could do that but when I drive

1106
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,599
0 to one I also drive 1 to two because

1107
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,839
it's the same frequency and two to three

1108
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,640
it's the same frequency and very quickly

1109
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:45,520
I leave my 01 Subspace that's a problem

1110
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,040
so we have to do something to make the

1111
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,680
circuit anharmonic and what we do is we

1112
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,880
add a Joseph's injunction now for our

1113
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,200
purposes here a Josephson Junction is a

1114
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,760
nonlinear inductor okay Brian Josephson

1115
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,119
gave us the current and voltage

1116
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,079
relationship uh through this device it's

1117
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,480
two superconducting leads separated by a

1118
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,359
thin tunneling barrier but when you

1119
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,680
combine it in the usual way to define

1120
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,000
inductance you find that the inductance

1121
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,440
value of this circuit element depends on

1122
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,359
how much current goes through it that's

1123
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,800
the definition of a nonlinear inductor

1124
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,240
its value changes as the current

1125
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,599
changes you could even integrate current

1126
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,160
and voltage in time to get the energy

1127
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,640
and what you find is the energy now is

1128
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,839
shaped like a cosine potential rather

1129
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,319
than this parabolic

1130
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:34,400
potential and so if I made a LC circuit

1131
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,960
but I made it with a nonlinear

1132
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,160
inductor the potential profile now shown

1133
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,960
in blue the cosine differs from a

1134
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,520
harmonic potential it's an anharmonic

1135
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,680
potential and what that translates to is

1136
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,520
the 01 frequency is now different than

1137
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,400
the one two frequency and that's what I

1138
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,359
need to stay in the 01 Subspace I drive

1139
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,760
that resonantly I'm off resonance with

1140
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,440
the other transition okay this circuit

1141
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,640
element in fact is a cubit that's used

1142
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,680
today quite widely it's called the

1143
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,160
transmon it's used at IBM um in

1144
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,920
different forms it's used at Google um

1145
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,920
you could think of this as the hydrogen

1146
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:14,440
atom for superconducting cubits

1147
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,480
okay now we have to cool them down to

1148
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,160
very low temperatures as I mentioned and

1149
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,240
how low well typically these cubits will

1150
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,520
have a frequency that's around a few

1151
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,319
gahz say 5 GHz that's a thermal energy

1152
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,800
of 250

1153
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:32,559
Kelvin if you equate KT and H bar Omega

1154
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,960
you want to be much colder than this uh

1155
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,359
you don't want the thermal environment

1156
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,720
to excite it so we want to operate say

1157
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:40,640
10 times colder around 20 Melvin and

1158
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,480
that's great because these refrigerators

1159
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,480
called dilution refrigerators get us

1160
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,760
down to that temperature now 40 50 years

1161
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,680
ago this was somebody's PhD project but

1162
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,079
today they're commercially available you

1163
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,839
just buy them we have 12 in our uh lab

1164
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,040
the uh engineering Quantum systems lab

1165
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:59,440
and many many faculty at MIT have

1166
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,920
refrigerators like this and you can see

1167
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,280
in here everything this about half a

1168
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,800
meter across half a meter down um and

1169
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:11,119
it's all at 20 Melvin right coaxes

1170
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,200
switches filters attenuators over time

1171
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,599
we've learned what works at these

1172
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,720
temperatures and of course that's what

1173
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,160
we

1174
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,040
use superc conducting cubits are

1175
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,960
fabricated um meaning that we

1176
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:25,920
manufacture them on Silicon this is a

1177
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,280
200 mm silicon wafer lots of cubits on

1178
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,400
here if we zoom in on one of the

1179
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,640
circuits you can see these five plus

1180
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,720
signs in a row those are five

1181
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,400
superconducting cubits the plus is

1182
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,119
actually the capacitor so rather than

1183
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,079
using parallel plate we just use

1184
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,920
something that's lateral and why a plus

1185
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,000
well we envision not just having a line

1186
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,160
of them but we want to go north south

1187
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,760
east and west so that's how we can

1188
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,200
connect to neighboring

1189
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,280
cubits if we zoom in further so that's

1190
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,880
the capacitor to ground if we zoom in

1191
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,160
further this little piece right here

1192
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,160
this Loop um is called a squid it's

1193
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,599
actually a Joseph's injunction two

1194
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,160
Joseph's injunctions in a loop with a

1195
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,640
property that if we put a magnetic field

1196
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,960
through that Loop we can actually tune

1197
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,800
the cubit's frequency that's useful the

1198
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,880
cubit's in the fridge I'd like to change

1199
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,119
its frequency how do I do that I just

1200
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,359
apply a little bit of current to an

1201
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,280
antenna and I can change the frequency

1202
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:19,960
and then the smallest feature size about

1203
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,599
100 nanometers is the Joseph's

1204
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,680
injunction itself so we're not pushing

1205
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:27,319
lithography here if anything these are

1206
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,800
very very large uh devices

1207
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:34,480
now how do we control it we control it

1208
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,280
with microwave um IQ mixing and so this

1209
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,839
planet Earth over here you can see the

1210
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,720
Cubit state in blue going around the

1211
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:44,119
earth and it's going around based on

1212
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,640
these uh pulses in red and I apologize

1213
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,240
the blue and the red on the left are not

1214
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,400
the same as the blue and the red on the

1215
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,839
right the blue and the red on the right

1216
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,520
is a result of uh inphase and quadrature

1217
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:59,559
mixing so the i port of a mixer we're

1218
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:01,880
going to say is blue the Q Port is red

1219
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,480
and your local oscillator going into

1220
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,280
this mixer gets multiplied by the I or

1221
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,800
the Q pulse and you just decide which

1222
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,680
pulse you want to send am I sending it

1223
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,280
to I or am I sending it to q and the the

1224
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,240
mixer multiplies them together and you

1225
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,400
get this pulse out and again if we tune

1226
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,960
the area of that pulse just right we can

1227
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,760
get either a pi pulse or a pi over 2

1228
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,400
pulse the difference between I and Q is

1229
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,200
a phase shift of 90° and that tells me

1230
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,760
whether I'm going to apply that pulse

1231
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,280
along the x-axis or the Y AIS of the

1232
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:36,160
block sphere so just standard IQ mixing

1233
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,800
is how we can control um these

1234
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,720
circuits so using this in our group we

1235
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,240
have more than four nines of single

1236
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,920
Cubit Fidelity and more than three nines

1237
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,160
of two Cubit uh Fidelity and the higher

1238
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,400
the Fidelity the better as we

1239
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,319
remembered now just to give a flavor the

1240
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,400
research I think Kevin will likely talk

1241
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,440
more about this in the afternoon is that

1242
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,480
it involves a lot and that's actually

1243
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,599
why it's taken a long time to develop

1244
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,880
quantum computers in general is um you

1245
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,800
need to develop the materials you need

1246
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,559
to analyze the materials design the

1247
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:12,520
circuit model it build your circuit

1248
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:14,880
fabricate it maybe involves some bump

1249
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,079
bonding some process monitoring then you

1250
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,000
have to cool it down in one of these

1251
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,599
refrigerators takes a lot of equipment

1252
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,599
and then you get some result out and

1253
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,480
then you validate or refute the

1254
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,960
hypothesis you had and then you iterate

1255
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,240
this many many times okay so we have

1256
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,599
this today but starting out you know

1257
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,559
this was basically a black box and

1258
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:35,119
people had to figure it out but I but

1259
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,599
things are accelerating quite rapidly in

1260
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,520
this field over the last five years

1261
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,920
precisely because we can now efficiently

1262
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,559
do this

1263
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:48,160
optimization if we look at the coherence

1264
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:51,440
over the last I would say 20 or 30 years

1265
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:54,440
first Cubit was about a nanc and today

1266
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:58,160
our cubits are actually at a millisecond

1267
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,559
and more and so that six plus orders of

1268
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,319
magnitude Improvement is part of the

1269
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,559
reasons why many companies are pursuing

1270
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,559
superc conducting cubits they've

1271
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,920
improved dramatically over the past many

1272
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,240
many

1273
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,240
years uh this is what quantum computers

1274
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:16,599
look like today uh IBM's ospre here in

1275
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,000
the lower left has

1276
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:23,839
433 I think something like that cubits

1277
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,200
this is uh Google's Willow chip uh which

1278
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,760
just had the very large announcement

1279
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,359
about the first time a Quantum error

1280
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,960
correcting code was beyond threshold

1281
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,839
that's a big deal uh this one in the

1282
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,240
middle is a neutral atom quantum

1283
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,640
computer called a Kila from qera a

1284
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,640
startup company started by Folks at

1285
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,079
Harvard and

1286
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:46,359
MIT uh this is quanum H1 chip this is a

1287
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:49,119
trapped ion chip in a racetrack style uh

1288
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:50,760
this is d-waves quantum aner it's also

1289
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,119
superconducting different type of

1290
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,040
quantum Computing we won't get into it

1291
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,119
today um this of course is not a quantum

1292
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,960
computer you'll recognize this as the

1293
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:01,880
right

1294
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,880
flyer um it wasn't the first time

1295
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,280
humankind had flown that that's actually

1296
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,440
a misconception we had hot air balloons

1297
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,000
we had gliders you know people jumping

1298
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,680
off cliffs with wings but this was the

1299
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,599
first time that it all came together

1300
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:18,920
there's a person on board steering

1301
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:21,040
self-propelled it took off it landed um

1302
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,319
if you read the history of this they did

1303
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,480
six flights that weekend crashed once or

1304
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:27,440
twice they had to go back and fix it and

1305
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,839
it I put it here because it reminds me

1306
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,040
of where we are today in Quantum

1307
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,440
Computing you know my students will say

1308
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,319
that things crash and they have to fix

1309
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,040
it every weekend probably but the point

1310
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:39,839
is that when we saw this particularly in

1311
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,400
hindsight when we see this event we know

1312
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:44,720
that commercial Aviation will come it

1313
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,400
clearly it's not ready yet but we know

1314
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,319
that the it's matured to a point where

1315
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,359
we can Envision commercial Aviation and

1316
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:55,640
I think by analogy that the quantum

1317
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:58,160
Computing systems that we see today are

1318
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,520
likely equally IM mature but have risen

1319
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,520
to the point where we can see that

1320
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,319
commercial Quantum Computing will come

1321
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,240
it's and to realize that we need to

1322
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:11,520
engineer the systems that are robust

1323
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,520
reproducible and

1324
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,480
extensible so in the last this will be

1325
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:20,160
my last slide because I'm running out of

1326
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,119
time the Grand Challenge today is

1327
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,920
quantum error correction so these

1328
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,200
computers can operate for a certain

1329
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,720
amount of time but eventually

1330
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,839
decoherence takes over and we lose uh we

1331
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,760
lose our Quantum

1332
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:37,640
coherence but that's not the end of the

1333
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,960
game uh fortunately um if we look at the

1334
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:42,280
physical cubits that we have today their

1335
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,040
error rates are one in 100 to say one in

1336
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,040
10,000 and groups around the world

1337
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,799
worked really hard to get the quality to

1338
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,960
that point that's pretty amazing right

1339
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:53,119
that out of 10,000 Gates only one

1340
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,000
failed but you could ask what do I need

1341
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,160
for practical you know commercial

1342
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,680
computing

1343
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,920
you need something in the billion to

1344
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,960
trillion range I I need to run a billion

1345
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,079
or a trillion operations in order to do

1346
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,240
something that's commercially useful and

1347
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,640
there's a big gap a giant chasm between

1348
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,440
these two points and how are we going to

1349
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,960
make it

1350
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,359
up by the way the transistor I mentioned

1351
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,880
before you know almost never fails and

1352
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,520
you know maybe one day we'll get to that

1353
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,200
point with Quantum Computing fortunately

1354
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,599
we don't have to get there to see the

1355
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,520
first commercial

1356
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:29,000
Advantage so the way that we're going to

1357
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,319
do it is called Quantum error correction

1358
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,319
and you can think of it as forming a

1359
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:36,280
team of cubits so rather than trying to

1360
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,960
encode information in a single Cubit

1361
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,680
we're going to form a team here it's a

1362
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,599
3X3 array so nine cubits that are yellow

1363
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,160
nine physical cubits together forms a

1364
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:50,680
team and that team is going to ideally

1365
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,760
outperform the uh individuals there now

1366
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,559
you also see some blue cubits here and

1367
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,960
the blue cubits are like referees or

1368
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,400
Checkers they're going to look at the

1369
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,040
neighbors they're going to say oh foul

1370
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,079
foul they're going to let us know so we

1371
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,839
can go back and

1372
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,760
correct now when we do that we call this

1373
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:09,640
thing a logical Cubit and when we do

1374
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,400
that The Logical error the error rate of

1375
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:16,280
The Logical cubit in fact has a

1376
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:19,280
prefactor that makes it worse okay

1377
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,760
obviously if we form a team um if we

1378
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,960
form a team of cubits um we need to do

1379
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,440
more work more gates more operations so

1380
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,839
that's a penalty but in implement this

1381
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,160
protocol we do get an exponential

1382
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:35,720
Advantage um and it's exponential in the

1383
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,480
size of our logical Cubit so the way

1384
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,559
that I think about this intuitively is

1385
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,960
Imagine imagine a room of

1386
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:43,359
kindergarteners heartwarming 20 or 30

1387
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,559
kindergarteners everybody running around

1388
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:48,119
screaming having a good time okay those

1389
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:50,680
were the cubits of 10 15 years ago all

1390
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:52,280
right if you add more kindergarteners to

1391
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,640
that class they're just going to get

1392
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,680
worse it's not going to get better okay

1393
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,000
but somewhere along our education

1394
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,799
trajectory we get to a point where if

1395
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,079
two people form a team they outperform

1396
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:06,040
any individual or three people or 10

1397
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:08,119
people or 20 people there's a threshold

1398
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,200
that we cross in our education and when

1399
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,799
we cross that threshold adding more

1400
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,280
people to a team makes the performance

1401
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:15,799
of the team better and better and better

1402
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,599
and in fact we have companies that have

1403
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:20,160
hundreds of thousands of people working

1404
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,799
together and this penalty here is okay

1405
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,119
now I need an HR department to keep it

1406
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:26,400
all straight but the benefit of putting

1407
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:28,520
all those people together outperforms

1408
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,720
not doing it okay so that's the concept

1409
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,319
of error correction and it's very

1410
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,400
powerful what I'm showing here is The

1411
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,359
Logical error per cycle uh on the

1412
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,319
vertical axis the horizontal axis is the

1413
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,280
error rate of the physical cubits and

1414
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:43,040
you can see they're quite different

1415
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,040
we're talking about a tenth of a percent

1416
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,160
error rate on the physical cubits one in

1417
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,040
a thousand but on this axis we're

1418
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,960
getting down to one in a million or more

1419
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,680
and the way that we do it is that we

1420
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,480
have to be on this side of the threshold

1421
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,440
the cubits they can't be kindergarteners

1422
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,280
they have to be more mature than that

1423
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,440
and the more mature they are the bigger

1424
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,200
Advantage we get by aggregating more and

1425
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,280
more cubits together into a logical

1426
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,319
Cubit and every time I increase the size

1427
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,599
of this distance three distance five

1428
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:13,079
distance seven I go down by the same

1429
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,000
factor that's this exponential

1430
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,920
Improvement and this is what Google

1431
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,599
showed or announced I should say in uh

1432
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,119
December full disclosure I work with

1433
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:27,079
them um and and was on this paper with

1434
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:29,799
them but what they showed is that um

1435
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:32,880
in red they have the distance three

1436
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:35,400
code in blue they have the distance five

1437
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,480
code and in dark I should say teal and

1438
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,000
then in dark blue they have the distance

1439
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,920
seven code and every time they increased

1440
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,880
the size of the team the error R rate

1441
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,200
went down by more than a factor two now

1442
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,000
of course we want to do better than that

1443
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,640
we'd love it to be a factor 10 but it

1444
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,160
works and this is the first time that

1445
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,720
this scaling with the size of the uh um

1446
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,720
logical Cubit has been shown in any

1447
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,799
technology this is a side of line we

1448
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,039
want to be on because we want to build

1449
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:04,880
quantum computers that have millions and

1450
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,480
millions of cubits and as we add more

1451
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,400
and more cubits the error rate better go

1452
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,839
down if it doesn't then we're still in

1453
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,280
the kindergarten era but we're not this

1454
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:14,960
was the first time it was shown so they

1455
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,400
demonstrated improved performance going

1456
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,559
from a distance three to a distance

1457
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,839
seven um there have been many

1458
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,240
demonstrations of quantum error

1459
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,079
correction with other modalities uh

1460
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,000
encoding logical cubits showing that

1461
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,280
they can turn the crank but this was the

1462
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,280
first time that it actually

1463
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,760
worked okay and so I think I'm going to

1464
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,640
stop there in the interest of time um I

1465
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,680
thank you for your attention and um we

1466
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,480
may be able to take a quick question or

1467
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,440
two but then I'm going to also invite I

1468
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:44,640
up to switch over to the next uh talk

1469
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,640
thank

1470
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,559
you it was a very good Inu a few things

1471
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,440
that I was confused about okay what two

1472
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,520
questions what is the relation of a

1473
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,480
coherence time and the error rate if the

1474
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,760
coherence time goes up does the error

1475
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:05,200
rate go down generally speaking yes for

1476
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,720
for a given technology because it it

1477
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,039
what matters is that you know how many

1478
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,440
operations can I do within that

1479
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,079
coherence time so if my operation time

1480
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,640
is always the same and I make the

1481
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:17,799
coherence time longer then I can do more

1482
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:20,640
operations on average before Things Fall

1483
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:25,400
Apart the second question is if your big

1484
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:27,760
diagram you showed that the up time uh

1485
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,680
was much if you only had one gate per

1486
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,599
cubid versus two gates per cuq does

1487
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:38,559
adding gate what do the adding Gates uh

1488
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:40,240
reduce the amount of time by so much and

1489
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,280
what is the advantage of having more

1490
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:45,240
gates per human sorry can you say that

1491
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm trying to remember which slide

1492
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:52,000
you're thinking of like 10 to the 5th uh

1493
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,880
it was the big slide of of performance

1494
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,280
of uh comparing different modalities yes

1495
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:01,079
that one okay and and what was the

1496
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,720
question again you had one cubit I one

1497
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,520
gate per cubit and two gates per cubit

1498
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:08,079
and you had two different numbers oh I

1499
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,920
see yes so I didn't thank you I did not

1500
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,160
mention that yeah so to do Universal

1501
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,760
Quantum computation you need single

1502
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,520
Cubit Gates and two Cubit Gates meaning

1503
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,880
an operation that I apply to only one

1504
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,559
cubit at a time or operations that I

1505
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,280
apply to two cubits at a time and so if

1506
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,119
we want to compare these different

1507
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,200
Technologies we can't just look at the

1508
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,160
single cubic gate although people often

1509
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,520
will say hey my single cubic gate is so

1510
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,880
good okay but you can't do Universal

1511
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,839
Quantum computation with that what's

1512
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,280
your two cubic gate Fidelity that's also

1513
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,319
important and that's why I had those two

1514
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:43,079
numbers on

1515
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:46,000
there the up for the two Cubit gate was

1516
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,119
much it tends to be harder that's right

1517
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,680
it tends to be lower Fidelity um

1518
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,559
precisely because uh it's more

1519
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,400
complicated there are two cubits that

1520
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:56,160
I'm trying to um operate in Tandem and

1521
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,559
as a result it generally is slower

1522
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,319
although not always um and it generally

1523
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,319
has lower Fidelity

1524
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:07,200
yeah good and I'll be around I'm happy

1525
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,520
to talk more offline or at the lunch

1526
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:13,319
today I don't want to eat into uh Ikes

1527
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,319
time so um
