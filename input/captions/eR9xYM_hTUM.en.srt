1
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:29,440
[Music] MIA is the avenue where you get the 
most cutting edge development and application of  

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,720
machineing. learning MIA is a seminar series where 
we bring in scientists and researchers from other  

3
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,240
universities and even from all over the world. So 
it it just creates communities which is important  

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,280
in science. All are coming together to solve a 
problem that will eventually impact patients life.  

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,000
That's the community that NIA has created. It's an 
interesting community, right? I mean now the field  

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,080
of machine learning or artificial intelligence or 
modeling uh is really you know fusing essentially  

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,240
with the biological systems. 10 years ago the two 
fields would really speak different languages have  

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,720
different cultures different taste and so on. And 
more and more I think we're seeing a convergence  

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,320
of the biological sciences and the computational 
ones becoming part. It's wonderful to have such  

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,200
a seminar hosted here uh where different 
researchers can come and and also focusing  

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,160
on some of the details and technicalities that go 
behind behind the methods that have been developed  

12
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,840
for biological data. MIA community is very unique 
in the sense it's very cross-sectional because we  

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,120
focus on models and inference and analysis as 
opposed to like a specific biological problem.  

14
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,800
the current place where MIA is especially with 
its strong association with the Schmidt center is  

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,720
that there are a lot of people who can provide 
input to projects that are happening in other  

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,840
parts of the broad and maybe even contribute. 
So I think kind of harnessing that availability  

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,160
of computational expertise and the variety 
of computational expertise I think would be  

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,320
very helpful. I've found mentors, I've found 
collaborators, people that I get to just kind  

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,520
of talk to about my science. um thought partners. 
It's been really fun to be a part of the community  

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,680
and then just kind of be able to like if I have 
a random idea, I be like, "Oh, this person had  

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
talked about something adjacent to it." It's quite 
exciting how much MIA has evolved over the past 10  

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
years. But I feel like that central theme of being 
a community of people that can work together and  

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,840
like kind of just rift off of ideas has stayed 
true, which is exciting. I hope that, you know,  

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,360
as as the field evolves, we're able to continually 
kind of change what we're talking about and change  

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,000
the nuances that we are considering in these 
conversations. Personally, I've I've gained  

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,440
so much. I love this community. I presented here 6 
years ago and it was probably one of the most like  

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,600
interactive talks I've ever been in with like 
the most like diverse group of computational  

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,160
people probably that I get to interact with. You 
have people who are in statistics and math and  

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,200
physics and they all have this interest in biology 
kind of widely speaking. the richness of always  

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,040
trying to to look out for new ideas and uh I just 
think it's a special community. This community is  

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,320
important because it's really important to stay 
grounded in both like the fundamentals as well  

32
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,520
as like the new things that are emerging in our 
in our field. I think it really helps in cross  

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,080
crosscontamination between different fields. Like 
I think those are one of the few places where you  

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,800
can take a computer scientist and a biologist and 
both of them can enjoy the talk where in other  

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,240
cases one of them will not have enough knowledge 
to understand what we're talking about. Presenting  

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,440
at MIA is a very uh unique experience. The 
separation between the primer and the main  

37
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,400
talk forces you to sit back and think about 
what is actually the best way to deliver this  

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,440
material and to engage with the audience. Getting 
to hang out with a bunch of cool speakers and cool  

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,920
organizers. And so I think that the MIA is just 
a very fun community in that regard. The concept  

40
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,920
of MIA is very special. In that span of a few 
hours, you're getting a beautiful throughine from  

41
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,040
foundational concepts all the way to the research 
that is state-of-the-art. I hope that others who  

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,160
attend the talks, they really do feel welcomed 
to join in the conversation, whether they're in  

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,640
the room or online, and recognize that MIA is more 
than just the talk series. We're putting a lot of,  

44
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,960
you know, powerful heads together. We're getting 
a lot of people in the same room who, you know,  

45
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,760
don't have the same background, may not have 
the same goals, but have have to understand  

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,120
in principle all of the same uh types 
of uh of things. At the end of the day,  

47
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,920
what's cool is that um you have a core group 
of people from at the Broad, other institutions  

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,280
and also industry that are coming that you see it, 
you know, again and again. One thing that's really  

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,640
cool is that we have a lot of junior people um 
and they feel comfortable asking questions and  

50
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,320
and having discussions and I think that um makes 
it really a lot more lively. The community that  

51
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,640
the MIE has created is so meaningful especially 
because it's trying to bridge the gap between  

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,720
industry and academia that has existed for 
a long time in this field and I think with  

53
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,400
AI needing more computational resources bridging 
that gap is super important right now. Hopefully  

54
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:20,800
this community grows more and more and more 
people are involved and learning a lot from it.
