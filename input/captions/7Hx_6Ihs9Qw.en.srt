questions so next is Zoe hello everybody

54
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm Zoe Abid Boyd and I was a 2023 MBA

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,720
graduate prior to Sloan I started my

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
career at Fisher Investments and I was

57
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,760
there for six and a half years in their

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
institutional group and I started as an

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,760
entrylevel analyst there was nobody who

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,319
was focusing on environmental social

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,040
governance investing and I watched a TED

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,920
Talk where it was like fake it t make it

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,000
so I was like I'm the

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,599
ESG expert uh and then over the last six

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,799
years that kind of became the truth uh

66
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,920
and I ended by managing their ESG

67
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:12,640
program so back then that was about $30

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,120
billion spread across 26 funds in four

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,159
continents and that was a load of fun um

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,440
post loan I'm at Goldman Sachs and I'm

71
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,799
in their private Wealth Management Group

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,159
and so I help families as well as

73
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,400
nonprofits think through all elements of

74
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,760
their financial careers and that's been

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,760

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,520
Drew hello everyone um happy to talk

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,280
with you this morning evening um before

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,160
SLO I was working as a CPA at

108
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,639
PWC um kind of in

109
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,400
Consulting and I joined as an MBA 22

110
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,400
because I wanted to somewhat similar to

111
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,120
Zoe to Pivot my career into renewable

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,479
energy specifically um kind of project

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,759
finance and excited to talk all about

114
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,479
that experience it led me to Marathon

115
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
Capital where I did a couple years in

116
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,479
Investment Banking right after

117
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,759
graduation here in Chicago and then I

118
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,120
just um as of kind of two months ago

119
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,840
transitioned to work at a battery energy

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,479
storage developer also based in Chicago

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:54,400
called HEC grid where I um lead kind of

122
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,440
m&a processes project financing um and

123
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,160
other internal Finance processes so

124
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,240
first question for the panelist is why

125
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,720
you chose Stone so what was your

126
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,080
motivation to um come to the stone like

127
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,360
when you like thinking out the the

128
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,440
school so let's go with

129
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,280
Austin yeah absolutely um I think mainly

130
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,000
due to the ability for me to get that

131
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,680
dual degree between the you know diving

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,280
technical knowing that I enjoyed and

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,720
loved engineering but also recognizing

134
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,840
that in my own career I wanted to sort

135
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
of develop that ership toolkit to sort

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,199
of further develop and and cultivate you

137
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,360
know the skills of others and being able

138
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,720
to do both of those together in a

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,319
two-year program was very very enticing

140
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,160
um which is sort of what ultimately led

141
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:54,160
me to wanting to go to this R

142
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,720
Salon thank you how about the The

143
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,919
Zo yeah um well I was not also in lgo I

144
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,479
loved having lgo friends so that was a a

145
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,919
nice part of the program just all being

146
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,560
in classes together I think um there was

147
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,080
a couple things like I think the way

148
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,479
Sloan was structured even with their

149
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,400
application uh it it was to explore and

150
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,400
learn and be curious so I loved that it

151
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,800
was the only school that I was looking

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,240
at that did not ask what your

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,720
future plans were like you know other

154
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,039
schools are like tell me your one-ear

155
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,199
plan your three-year plan but I think

156
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,400
you know Sloan is all about exploration

157
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,039
discovery and also what I think is a

158
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,360
little bit more realistic is you're not

159
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,960
really sure and so I love that the core

160
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,520
semester was a semester you know other

161
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,879
other schools it's like an entire year

162
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,960
so you know we had the required

163
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,520
curriculum but then beyond that we could

164
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,639
do all sorts of different things another

165
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,440
thing that appealed to me was the

166
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,479
entrepreneurship uh I took a lot of

167
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,240
classes in the Martin trust Center and

168
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,720
uh if if any of you are thinking about

169
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,440
that I highly advise Bill Let's class

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,440
Paul Chek they excellent professor

171
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,120
um and I think also just when I visited

172
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,560
the campus it just like people just came

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,400
up to me they're like oh hi like why are

174
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,199
you here like do you need help like do

175
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,759
you want directions and I was like oh

176
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,039
I'm just here to learn more about the

177
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,440
school and they engaged with me and

178
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,800
talked with me in a way that I didn't

179
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,479
see at some of the other schools I

180
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,199
visited so I would say the culture of

181
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,039
career and exploration the

182
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,039
entrepreneurship and the collaborative

183
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,039
environment

184
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,479
that's true um the first the first um

185
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,839
Point zo mentioned like um MIT won't ask

186
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,719
you about the future goal in the

187
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,560
admission um um admission like a

188
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,120
application um they they they always say

189
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,880
um the past achievement is will show the

190
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,839
the um the what you going to do like for

191
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,000
the future and your capability for that

192
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,399
so I think it's quite um different

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,320
things that of the MIT St from the

194
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,760
different

195
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,640
schools how about you okay just one more

196
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,880
100% like I didn't go to Sloan being

197
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,800
like I'm going to be a private wealth

198
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,040
adviser Goldman Sachs I had some ideas

199
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,200
of things I wanted to do I worked on a

200
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,680
startup I went through mit's Delta V

201
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,680
accelerator program I thought I wanted

202
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,399
to do VC like but the point I'm getting

203
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,399
across is there was just there was a lot

204
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,160
of room to explore and I wasn't pigeon

205
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,160
to hold into one

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,279
thing great how about you Linette what

207
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,880
was your motivation to come to SL oh I

208
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,360
wanted to be around a bunch of nuts like

209
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,360
me

210
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,959
yeah so I stayed on the I stayed in the

211
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,440
Doms um and I felt like I was on the set

212
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:42,720
of Big Bang Theory uh with the rest of

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,480
of MIT um uh and their equations on the

214
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,959
walls and all that uh yeah but yeah okay

215
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,959
to to be honest it was more around the

216
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,040
well both the intersection of tech and

217
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,079
and um entrepreneurship um I did my

218
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,640
startup through through Sloan um and I

219
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,760
want all the support from that and what

220
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,640
I loved is yes I did a love the

221
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,399
entrepreneurship classes so I go to

222
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,800
class in in in the day and then straight

223
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,920
away I can apply stuff that uh we

224
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,200
learned from the professors who were

225
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,399
largely all practitioners and had their

226
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,680
own startups as well or or well no

227
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,399
longer startups but by then huge

228
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:27,839
companies um and apply it uh with my

229
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,880
business right at night so a lot of that

230
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,279
around that and I I I do

231
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,600
um zo Point as well but books are just

232
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,600
really

233
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
nice

234
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,519
yeah thank you

235
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,079
JW yeah for me I very similar to Zoe I

236
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,800
kind of had an idea of what I wanted to

237
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:53,040
do going into my MBA I wanted to

238
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,519
transition my career into sustainability

239
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,800
but didn't exactly know what that would

240
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,399
look like in terms of type of company

241
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,600
and what my role would be within that

242
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,480
company and so I kind of immediately was

243
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,639
drawn to Sloan because it had one of the

244
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,760
first and strongest kind of bestd

245
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,200
developed sustainability programs out of

246
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,399
really really any MBA program you could

247
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,399
compare it to so that was one of the

248
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,920
first things and then I was really sold

249
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,800
I um was able to visit campus actually

250
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,639
at an lgbtq visit day which was which

251
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,600
was perfect um but there's just

252
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,440
something different about kind of once

253
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,440
you get to campus once you join the

254
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,480
class everything else that's got that

255
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,360
happened you know everyone doesn't

256
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,800
really care what your prior career was

257
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
or what your prior work was it's really

258
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,000
what are you going to make of your

259
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,720
program going forward and everyone was

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,480
there to support you to make that

261
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,279
transition or make that change it really

262
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:54,639
felt like a a very supportive not

263
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,040
cutthoat at all culture and so the

264
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,040
combination of the program with the

265
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,519
people I really wanted to be around

266
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,639
there just really wasn't another program

267
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:06,600
that had both those things for

268
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,320
me that's that's really true um like for

269
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,320
me also I feel that way I'm very

270
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,720
tightnit community and supportive and we

271
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,920
are quite close to each

272
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,199
other so next question is about the the

273
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,120
your experience in the community as

274
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:27,399
longan so um for the lgbtq students we

275
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,079
have the long pride and we I want to ask

276
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,199
about your experience and mement into

277
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,279
the the St Pride or other kind of the

278
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:38,399
community here

279
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:41,360
so the we can ask the L how was your

280
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,760
experience in the community in

281
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,680
thr yeah um I mean to be honest I wasn't

282
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,959
that active with a lot of um slown sub

283
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,760
communities right but um from the first

284
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:58,320
after settling it for a couple of months

285
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,760
um uh I I decided to go for an impromptu

286
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,079
hike with some folks from SLO pride and

287
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,880
right after that I ended up going for

288
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,639
everything that was organized by by them

289
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,680
um and in my second year I was part of

290
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,440
the admissions team um as well within PR

291
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,639
even though I had no intention on

292
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,040
joining a student group to that level

293
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,040
just with the just with the my work

294
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,720
commitments as well um yeah so Pride was

295
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,600
really the only student grp that I was

296
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,760
very dedicated to let say um lots of

297
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,920
nice uh lots of great folks um that I'm

298
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:39,800
still in contact with uh and we we did a

299
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,560
lot of things together I think um I see

300
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,199
some questions also around like like

301
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:48,440
activities that were were done like

302
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:51,759
Halloween nights uh RBA was huge for um

303
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,440
folks who um look into recruiting and

304
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,440
also meeting uh private folks from the

305
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,680
other the other business schools as well

306
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,680
so highly recommend attending that as

307
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,399
well

308
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,120
um and yeah uh we had very good

309
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,839
precedence as well the year that um yeah

310
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,320
the years that we're around um what I

311
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,160
also like about pride is that they were

312
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,160
very welcoming to uh SOS or and part

313
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,199
Partners as well um it feels like they

314
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,320
they're an extens they are an extension

315
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,600
of of the SLO community and sometimes

316
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
it's nice you just hang out with the

317
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,399
part you hang out the partners sometimes

318
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,600
more than the students if they are

319
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,040
studying too much or stuff um

320
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,480
yes so that's my my involvement with SL

321
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,639
PR

322
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,320
least thank you lyette um what about you

323
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,320
zoy how about your involvement and

324
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,639
experience in the community here in

325
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,440
stone yeah yeah no I'm smiling at the

326
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,759
Lynette's comment because uh you know we

327
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,279
obviously the same year we're good

328
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,160
friends and um one of our our Pride's

329
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,399
co-presidents was actually an so so I

330
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,000
couldn't Echo enough how welcoming the

331
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,240
group is to partner

332
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,959
and you know I've been thinking about

333
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,720
this a lot this week because I knew I

334
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,959
was going to speak on this panel and I'm

335
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,800
a year out and it's funny because the

336
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,199
experience was incredible there uh it

337
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,199
was the first time in my life that I was

338
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:18,079
actually part of a pride group and I

339
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,120
think I'm only in hindsight realizing

340
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,519
how impactful that was so you know

341
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,680
growing up I remember you know my

342
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,600
brother went to the University of

343
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,480
Chicago he's four years older than me I

344
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,120
looked up to him at the time he was like

345
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,639
my mentor poor and you know my family's

346
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
liberal they don't like they didn't care

347
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,759
that I was gay but he said you know oh

348
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,560
like gay people you know it's fine I

349
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,040
don't care they're gay but they're just

350
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,959
so obsessed with being gay um and he

351
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
said that to me when I was in high

352
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,120
school and I remember like I think I

353
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,279
internalized I was like oh crap I I

354
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,639
don't want to be one of those gay people

355
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,839
that's always being gay and so

356
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,319
unbeknownst to me I spent like the first

357
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,560
like before Sloan the first half of my

358
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:59,079
professional career kind of covering

359
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,759
being gay um it's one of the weird uh

360
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,079
you know we're minorities and for what

361
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,600
you know but we can hide it you know I

362
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,319
can I can be straight if I if I need to

363
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,240
be in a certain situation um and I don't

364
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,360
think it was until I went to the first

365
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,040
Pride Retreat like echoing what Lynette

366
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,680
said and I just I

367
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,319
immediately felt the power of having

368
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,040
everyone in a room who has a shared

369
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:22,680
experience one of the Fantastic things

370
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,959
about Sloan which I don't know if we've

371
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,199
mentioned is like how diverse it is like

372
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,240
I think my year was like 43%

373
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,560
International so I'm in a room with

374
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,480
people you know from Singapore from

375
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,759
India and Korea and all over the world

376
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,240
and in a lot of ways like we have lives

377
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:43,360
that aren't similar but we all kind of

378
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
without like we we don't need to talk

379
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,560
about we just sort of have this Mutual

380
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,680
understanding and connection and I felt

381
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,720
that immediately through the slone pride

382
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,279
group um so you know in terms of events

383
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,600
they have a fall Retreat and we we rent

384
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,639
out a huge cabin and spend the whole

385
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,759
weekend together they have a Spring

386
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,640
retreat to providenc toown Rhode Island

387
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,679
which I didn't know until I went that's

388
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,280
like a a gay town and a really fun place

389
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,199
to be and going through all of those

390
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,559
different activities was incredibly

391
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,319
meaningful to

392
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,480
me yeah we we in the St Pride we have

393
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,240
the different type of the events like a

394
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,720
small gathering to um the big um The

395
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,240
Retreat like go into the some um big

396
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,320
house and we going to stay there and we

397
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,679
have the different type of activities

398
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:38,200
there so which is quite nice for me also

399
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,160
so I want to shift the topic to the

400
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,039
about the recruiting and the any like

401
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,280
kind of resources to support the lgbtq

402
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:50,000
students in the recruiting so um how

403
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,280
about your experience

404
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,640
htin if you use any um resources to

405
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,080
support your recruiting

406
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,520
Journey yeah I might this is probably

407
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,400
not the best person the anth this

408
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,120
because maybe I'm a littleit of an

409
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,640
oddball but I didn't use too many

410
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,880
resources at the time however I

411
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,000
recognized afterwards that there were

412
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,640
several you know certainly to Drew's

413
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,679
Point there's the lgbtq visit day which

414
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
can be super impactful to kind of

415
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,960
experience slan and understand maybe

416
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,919
even what the Prides Community is all

417
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,400
about and even at MIT as a whole there

418
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,880
are other additional resources such as I

419
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,400
think the websites lgbtq mit.edu

420
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,039
that has several different resources to

421
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,320
prepare you as a queer student on campus

422
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,400
um and

423
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,679
so I wish I'd capitalize and utilize

424
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,559
those as trying to learn more

425
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,039
information um and I think those are

426
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,320
something that we should you know talk

427
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,440
about more and people should

428
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,840
utilize thank you how about your

429
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,280
experience

430
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,000
through do did you use any kind of

431
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:03,159
resources like a for the the support

432
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,440
yeah um like many other kind of top

433
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,600
Business Schools slan um attends Ramba

434
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,919
which I think glennette mentioned

435
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,120
earlier which if you're not um familiar

436
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:17,760
with Ramba it's kind of the largest MBA

437
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:22,039
Gathering um for lgbtq folks it's

438
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,640
usually in October or November um and so

439
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,120
that's a great opportunity especially

440
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,280
kind of depending on what recruiting

441
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,880
cycle you're looking at it kind of gets

442
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,880
you in the door sooner um pretty much

443
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,840
every company will start filling their

444
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,400
summer internship spots with folks from

445
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,080
Ramba before kind of opening their their

446
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:47,080
General application so that's a um a

447
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,000
great thing to get plugged into even um

448
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,400
on your first couple days and weeks at

449
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,120
Sloan and slan pride always sends a huge

450
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,880
contingent there

451
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,520
um so that is one of the kind of the

452
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,720
best recruit

453
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,039
options the CDO the um I think it's

454
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,640
career development office at also has

455
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:14,200
someone um specific to son Pride members

456
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,720
to um think through lgbtq

457
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,559
specific um uh questions you may have

458
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,440
going through interviews or how to

459
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:24,280
portray something on your resume um if

460
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,640
there if you have any particular

461
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,200
questions about um you know about how to

462
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,240
portray your identity or something like

463
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,880
that so there's certainly a lot of

464
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,000
resources specific to our community that

465
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,880
um someone puts together that to really

466
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,880
make your recruiting um

467
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,400
successful thank you so much um this

468
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:49,640
year RBA is happening in the Los Angels

469
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,520
like this I think it's is September and

470
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,799
yeah like a lot of companies like from

471
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,880
the Consulting of pharmaceuticals or

472
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:58,600
like to the international uh

473
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,080
organization will come and to have the

474
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,520
the network and uh yeah so like that's

475
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,360
it's a good resource for the the

476
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:11,760
students like in the stor

477
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:14,120
Pride so um my question is uh about the

478
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,159
engagement in the communities outside of

479
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,200
the stone so there is like a MIT white

480
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,600
um lgbtq um Association also and there

481
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,640
is the Harvard there is greater Boston

482
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,240
community so is there anyone like

483
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,520
engaged into in the communities outside

484
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,520
of

485
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,679
um I would say not I would say from my

486
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,480
involvement the biggest one was kind of

487
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:51,200
cross events with the Harvard MBA um

488
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,640
Pride group and so we hosted a few

489
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:59,039
different happy hour mixer type events

490
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:01,640
which was um fun especially um t ually

491
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,760
related you can cross register for

492
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,360
courses at Harvard Business School um

493
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,320
and most people will take advantage of

494
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,159
um some cross register opportunity

495
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,320
whether it's at HBS or somewhere else at

496
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,960
Harvard so um a lot of times they were

497
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,440
classmates and then you would get to see

498
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,640
them as well at kind of mixers or other

499
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,720
events that we would host between the

500
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,200
two groups so I think that for me was my

501
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,600
most involvement but to the broader

502
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,400
question of the community in Boston

503
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,480
um I would say it's a very welcoming

504
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,720
open City there wasn't ever a time with

505
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,919
me and my sort of identity that I didn't

506
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,080
feel comfortable um being out um with my

507
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,600
partner or with the pride group in

508
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,120
general or specifically even just

509
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:53,559
wearing kind of the pride shirt which um

510
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,480
for Sloan you know has MIT and uh big

511
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,240
kind of rainbow colors I didn't ever

512
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,679
feel uncomfortable wearing that out and

513
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,000
about um

514
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,480
so but I obviously that's specific to me

515
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,480
I know other people could have different

516
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,600
experiences thank you so much htin yeah

517
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
I think also generally with the

518
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,440
community to to Drew's point you know

519
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,360
beyond I think the the cross

520
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,080
MBA you know there are a lot of

521
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,159
opportunities to or smaller

522
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,240
opportunities that might be a little bit

523
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,880
harder to find in terms them engaging

524
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,880
with the queer community in say

525
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,600
Cambridge or Boston like you know silly

526
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,480
things that I you know there's a a

527
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,320
poetry night every Wednesday night at a

528
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,039
bar in Central Square and that is one of

529
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,799
the weest safest spaces I think I've

530
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,159
ever been to where I can kind of put my

531
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,320
mask down and listen to people you know

532
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,120
share their Beautiful Stories whatever

533
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,640
that is or you know within like other

534
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,039
other cities as well there's some lgbtq

535
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,840
specific sports leagues um so if you

536
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:57,240
ever find the time as a a business

537
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,799
school student to go beyond Sloan um

538
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,640
there are those as well where you can

539
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,880
kind of connect with the community with

540
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,840
people over really all ages um I was

541
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,679
fortunate enough to do that when I

542
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,440
immediately after graduation when I was

543
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,240
in the Boston area and so a lot of those

544
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,799
I think resources or activities or

545
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,320
things exist it does require maybe a

546
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,039
little bit additional amount of

547
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,480
searching and exploration but to Drew's

548
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,559
Point Boston is a very you know safe

549
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,919
City at least in in in my experience

550
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,320
granted I also admit I'm a cisgender

551
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,840
white male so um it might be a little

552
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,360
bit different experience for others but

553
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,640
um it is the community is there and it

554
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,640
is

555
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:45,080
strong yeah no I totally Echo that um

556
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,880
and the swag I thought was the best out

557
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,000
of the pride Club there's some good swag

558
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,919
it's SL but the pride Club the gay

559
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,120
sweaters are wonderful and I also wore

560
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,840
them all the time my partner wears them

561
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,480
all the time like no issues uh the only

562
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,399
thing in terms of recruiting I wanted to

563
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,000
add these are more nonprofits on the

564
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,960
National level but they all have Boston

565
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,480
chapters is there's out professionals

566
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,000
and so that's a phenomenal nonprofit um

567
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,240
that is really as the title means like

568
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,640
just bringing together lgbtq

569
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,000

570
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,320
there's a couple that are like more

571
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,080
industry specific so like start out if

572
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,960
you're working on any kind of uh startup

573
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,840
they have a ton of resources while I was

574
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,520
working at a startup at MIT I got a

575
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,240
mentor through start out and that was

576
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,600
fantastic and there all across the

577
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,120
country um and then there's there's more

578
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,440
like specific ones so there's out in

579
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,840
Tech um and then there's out in finance

580
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,000
so there's there a ton of organizations

581
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,919
out there that can help and then rhoma

582
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,760
was phenomenal definitely go to the rhba

583
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,000
conference because there's recruiters

584
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,600
from every major company that you'd want

585
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,880
to work at there and you can get coffee

586
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,880
chats and it's a really great way to

587
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,880
connect thank you so much

588
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,919
so last question for the the panelist um

589
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,440
is about your experience um after the

590
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,440
graduation so which means um how you

591
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,799
engage yourself with the community of

592
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,600
the MIT like Alam Association or any

593
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:21,240
kind of like a community that really do

594
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,520
to MIT so how how's your experience like

595
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,520
after

596
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,600
graduation is there anyone

597
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,559
kle um working in Renewables there's

598
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,600
definitely a very strong contingent of

599
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,840
sonies working all across Renewables in

600
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,399
terms of both very established large

601
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,799
companies startups and everything in

602
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:49,200
between so that's been um great not only

603
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,159
because I was recently job hunting but

604
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,559
even before that just you constantly had

605
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,440
every company you interact with or every

606
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:01,039
place you go or running into

607
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:03,399
sonies um another opportunity again sort

608
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,720
of specific to energy but it applies

609
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:08,279
pretty much in any sector you would go

610
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,600
into there's a renewable energy Finance

611
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,000
Round Table hosted at Sloan I think it's

612
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,600
twice a year

613
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,080
um uh once in the spring and once in the

614
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,159
fall and so I participated in that it's

615
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,919
a great um just group of sonies working

616
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:27,600
in energy and Renewables from um so all

617
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,120
sorts of programs and class years coming

618
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,399
together to think through what's kind of

619
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,480
the next Frontier what's the um next big

620
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,919
problem that we would want to solve and

621
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,640
um you know as these things happen as I

622
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,480
was looking for a job one of the people

623
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,600
in the room that I've kind of connected

624
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,760
with has been a mentor for me was said

625
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,519
hey like I'm looking for someone with

626
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,159
this type of experience like let me know

627
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,799
if you're interested and that sort of

628
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,840
stuff I think happens a lot with the

629
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,919
son's helping son's mindset um if you

630
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,870
need help getting connected to someone

631
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,200
or

632
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,919
[Music]

633
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,240
um uh are just looking to get

634
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,399
information on something Aon is always

635
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,600
your first place to turn because either

636
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,600
they'll know or they'll get you

637
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,600
connected to someone who can so the

638
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,919
elimin network post sonone is probably I

639
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,480
thought it was important while you're at

640
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,480
s but it's even sort of more important

641
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,840
now how about you Lynette I think you're

642
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,960
back to Singapore but how was your

643
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,399
experience um after graduation

644
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,159
yeah um so one thing that I did not

645
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,200
expect is the number of wedding invites

646
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,760
you get like in the one year one or two

647
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,919
years after SL like everybody gets

648
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,679
married after school uh which is great

649
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,039
and that's an excuse to meet up again I

650
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,440
see all the other panelists smiling you

651
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:48,519
know it's true um so I me socially

652
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,559
that's one thing in

653
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:55,279
um it's I've gotten connected with like

654
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:59,360
the MIT Club of Singapore uh the broader

655
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,880
the broader MIT um Network out here um I

656
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:07,080
would say primarily in Southeast Asia or

657
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:08,640
Asia um H that you've got folks who are

658
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,399
I mean the most active ones are are

659
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,720
those who graduated um MIT maybe 20

660
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,679
years ago um so that's a that's a Fun

661
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,640
Bunch to kind of be connected with and

662
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,039
and get to know uh for SLO itself there

663
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:26,200
is a southeast Asia gang so actually I'm

664
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,480
meeting a bunch of them this weekend uh

665
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,240
because somebody from Thailand's coming

00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:31,720
SL Alum um I would say % of the time you

687
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,720
will get a response from

688
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:41,840
them that's hear that so um next section

689
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:46,080
is about the the Q&A session with the um

690
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:50,240
the attendees so I will get back to the

691
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,840
Staten yeah absolutely I'm back so um to

692
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,039
that point first I'll start off by

693
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,519
saying thank you everyone for for

694
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,279
sharing your own experiences and

695
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,279
providing all the um uh the account that

696
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,960
you've had from your own uh Sloan

697
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,760
experience and we definitely have a few

698
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,480
uh questions for everybody in the chat

699
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,080
some pointed more uh just trying to get

700
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,600
uh an Insight from your own experiences

701
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,960
so I wanted to start off by asking a

702
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,360
couple of questions about the Sloan

703
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,159
curriculum um and really to start off um

704
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,080
you know many of our uh attendees know

705
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,799
that the Sloan's course load can be

706
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,840
considered regular rigorous especially

707
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,399
if you're in the lgo program um is there

708
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,519
an example that's uh you can provide

709
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,960
when you were academically challenged

710
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,639
and then in addition to that what

711
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,200
resources were at your disposal that

712
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,200
leveraged you to

713
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,159
succeed sure I

714
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,320
guess for my I think the biggest

715
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:51,519
resource is honestly the culture of the

716
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,440
people so for example with lgo program

717
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,559
in the fall we're taking all those

718
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,600
standard classes um as an typical

719
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,000
business school student will and on top

720
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,679
of that we might be already taking

721
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,880
another one or two engineering classes

722
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,440
or if someone really likes to get busy

723
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,639
they'll be doing research or something

724
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,320
crazy like

725
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:13,120
that there are various moments during

726
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,000
that I think that work overload where

727
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,880
everyone always collectively comes

728
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,320
together in order to help solve these

729
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,200
problems to work together so if you're

730
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,200
in the same class as someone business

731
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,440
school engineering whatever might be

732
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,039
five of you are going to be getting

733
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,639
together to finish that homework or to

734
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,679
finish that report or finish that paper

735
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:33,320
and you know you're bouncing ideas off

736
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,200
of each other you're learning from each

737
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,279
other and that experience and it makes

738
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,000
everything a bit easier or significantly

739
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,600
easier I think that is a huge

740
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,399
resource um a second resource that's a

741
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,919
little bit more tangential is that MIT

742
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,480
has really good mental health services

743
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,000
um so if any point you do feel

744
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:58,159
overloaded or stressed they are a easy

745
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,080
call Easy consultation away um which has

746
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,960
been um at least for some of my peers

747
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,559
super super useful to help sort of kind

748
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,600
of help you take control of your own

749
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,840
situation whatever that might be um

750
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,720
de-stress um and figure out what a best

751
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,720
path forward might

752
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,399
be

753
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,000
awesome um I just thought of one thing

754
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:30,360
that relates to this so I'll add to that

755
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,279
um one thing also that really drew me to

756
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,960
Sloan versus other um programs is that

757
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,639
we do have some classes that are case

758
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,559
based but we're not 100% case based and

759
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:44,760
some things really fit a case model and

760
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:47,360
some things just don't right um so I

761
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,880
think that Variety in coursework really

762
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,320
um kept things challenging but probably

763
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,320
more importantly

764
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,120
interesting um and then to the point of

765
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,399
when I was challenged most I just kind

766
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,639
of remembered this so I wanted to share

767
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,679
of course you can take as many like data

768
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:05,039
classes and super Advanced Finance

769
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,919
classes as you want but one of the times

770
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,560
I was most challenged was um in a the

771
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,079
course was some called something like

772
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,480
difficult conversations and basically

773
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,800
each week all we did was um talk through

774
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,399
a particular situation where you would

775
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,280
have to have a difficult situ a

776
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:24,639
difficult

777
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:29,520
conversation examples would be when you

778
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,879
would experience or or see um some sort

779
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,919
of discrimination in the workplace

780
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:36,599
either you experienced or someone else

781
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,399
and you would just literally inclass

782
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:44,320
practice intervening or practice saying

783
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:47,159
how you would um follow up on something

784
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,520
um if you were pushing and some of them

785
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,560
were identity based and some of them

786
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,879
were you know you're you're pushing for

787
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,320
raise or you're you need to apologize to

788
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,920
someone for something that you did those

789
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,040
were I think actually some of the most

790
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:05,720
um academic I guess like challenging for

791
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,920
me because it was really taking sort of

792
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,320
what you might think as everyday

793
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,520
situations but putting them into

794
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,200
practice for like multiple hours a week

795
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:20,000
and really thinking through um not only

796
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,000
the ideas behind it but but implementing

797
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,760
that thank you both for um uh providing

798
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:35,640
that perspective I think to to tag on to

799
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,320
that question another one focused in on

800
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,240
um our curriculum is could you give an

801
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,320
example of fun or interesting ways that

802
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,680
you took advantage of the academic

803
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,720
freedom to take courses outside of the

804
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,040
required curriculum whether that be some

805
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,440
of the electives that you took or even

806
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,800
opportunities to um cross-register with

807
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,400
the broader MIT Community Andor some of

808
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,040
our um partner schools such as harbard I

809
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,680
suppose for myself um you know because

810
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:08,319
you're able to take classes across MIT

811
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,760
as a whole there is a wide variety that

812
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:11,560
you'd be surprised about like for

813
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,800
instance I took this very fun design

814
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,040
class around interaction design which

815
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,720
had nothing to do with either my degrees

816
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,720
but allowed me to get like a different

817
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,760
insight and maybe to what an industrial

818
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,960
designer would look at I knew a

819
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,560
different lgo that took a music class as

820
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,760
an elective um specifically I think

821
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,440
around music composition

822
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,000
um so it's like one of those little

823
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,640
extra freedoms where you know maybe it's

824
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,680
not ultimately what you're going to be

825
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,400
doing long time down the road uh my

826
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,760
friend is definitely not a professional

827
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,839
guitarist but it allows you to you know

828
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,119
sprinkle in you know maybe some of your

829
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,640
other passions or interests um

830
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,560
alongside

831
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,920
uh I guess maybe some of your classes

832
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,920
specifically towards career

833
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:03,040
goals yeah for me um I said uh I did

834
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,440
intership at Jordan the Middle East but

835
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,000
which I didn't expect before I came to

836
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,760
SL actually and I took one class about

837
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,240
the entrepreneurship ecosystem uh in the

838
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,640
spring semester and I focused in the

839
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,920
Middle East and some countries there and

840
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,440
I got interested in that and I tried to

841
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:26,800
reach um the the opportunities there so

842
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,880
um some some um opportunities are not

843
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,160
expected like like a when you like apply

844
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,680
to the St or when you come to Sol but um

845
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,079
I think um you can find a lot of

846
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,240
opportunities um unseeing for you right

847
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,200
now yeah I took a couple of classes um

848
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:49,640
um with wider outside out outside of SLO

849
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:52,359
uh MIT uh community so one of them was a

850
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,359
well still kind of this still related to

851
00:37:52,359 --> 00:38:00,400
to my work but uh what was a kind of VC

852
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:01,680
cause for engers um and what was fun

853
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,119
about that class was that we actually

854
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,760
look at some of the undergrads um and I

855
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,800
think it's like if you get an MIT

856
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,359
undergrad uh that's a whole different

857
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,920
level right um what was fun about that

858
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:23,040
class is that we the professor actually

859
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:26,880
had us go to um uh lawyer and VC offices

860
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,359
um downtown to have that simulation uh

861
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,160
practice of like negotiating a term

862
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,599
sheet um going through prepping with

863
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,920
your lawyer um and then kind of seeing

864
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,800
uh what kind of things you can push back

865
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,280
on which ones are like reasonable u fles

866
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,720
in your term sheet but that that

867
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,480
practical exercise of actually speaking

868
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,000
with a a real lawyer and a real VC um

869
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,240
that was that was very impactful uh the

870
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,839
other one I did was a was a mental

871
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:58,760
health um mental health Tech uh course

872
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:04,839
and it was taught by is taught by by the

873
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:07,520
like the guru of it um uh rosart and the

874
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:10,920
um yeah she's been doing work in this

875
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,240
area for for over 20 years um so what

876
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,839
was cool about that class was again it

877
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:19,599
was a very diverse mix of people who are

878
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,280
just interested in mental health but um

879
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,160
the level of like Innovation and stuff

880
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,760
that she was sharing and that she had

881
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,280
speakers come in to to talk about for

882
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,640
for this area was was phenomenal but

883
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,560
that that that CA remember the workload

884
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,119
was really heavy for it so I so I

885
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,760
audited the class um and you can do that

886
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,359
too you can just sit in and and not have

887
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,160
to do the work or the class that's

888
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,160
that's also a nice way around it I

889
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,839
guess awesome thank you everyone so we

890
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,880
have a few more questions coming in uh

891
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:57,920
for this one um uh this is open to

892
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,960
anyone who'd like to answer could you

893
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,839
speak to how you personally exemplify

894
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,640
Sloan's mission statement which again is

895
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,560
to uh develop principled Innovative

896
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,839
leaders who improve the world and

897
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,760
general ideas that advanced management

898
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,240
practice I love this question because I

899
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,680
wondered this the entire two years I was

900
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:23,760
like what does being a principled leader

901
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,240
mean like what you know um and they when

902
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,800
you go to graduate they actually make

903
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:31,119
you sign uh like this mission statement

904
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,599
like I agree to do these

905
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,359
things um and so I think it's I think

906
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,839
it's different for everyone I think the

907
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,720
cool part of the curriculum is starting

908
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,480
in core semester but then throughout

909
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:46,280
your time at Sloan there's a lot of

910
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,640
classes across different like you know

911
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,800
even like Finance to organizational

912
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,359
development to entrepreneurship to

913
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,760
philosophy that really make you think

914
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,160
about um what your leadership style is

915
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,119
and how you embody that as a leader so I

916
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,440
think for me over the two years I

917
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,839
ultimately came to the conclusion that

918
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,640
um being a principled leader was being

919
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:14,960
authentic and as that relates to Pride I

920
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:18,160
mean that was really me being my whole

921
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,040
self in the workplace and so um you know

922
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,599
I mentioned like before Sloan and before

923
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,160
the pride group and before thinking

924
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,720
about being a principal leader I thought

925
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,200
it was unprofessional to talk about your

926
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,240
orientation and I was like oh that's not

927
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,280
that's not business related um but then

928
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,440
I realized like that was actually

929
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,680
holding me back from um being my you

930
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,359
know authentic self but also just like

931
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,119
in weird ways that you can't exactly

932
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,280
measure so post loan I mean for my team

933
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,920
I'm in charge of our business

934
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,640
development and I've literally put being

935
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,040
lgbtq

936
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,480
into my business plan um and so you know

937
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,720
I'm the only

938
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,800
lgbtq private wealth advisor Goldman

939
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,800
Sachs in their San Francisco office and

940
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,880
I think that's like a huge opportunity

941
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,520
to look into our community and to

942
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,520
connect with our professionals and the

943
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,200
lgbtq Chamber of Commerce and to tap

944
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,240
into that and I don't think I would have

945
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,760
thought about it that way had I not gone

946
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,839
through the exercise of thinking about

947
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,000
the mission statement thinking about

948
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,480
what leadership meant and then how I

949
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
could embody that because you know I say

950
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,920
I'm the only one but I maybe I'm not I

951
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,319
don't know I mean I I came out when I

952
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,680
was 16 which I I didn't know if that was

953
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,040
young or old during Pride I met a lot of

954
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,200
people who you know were 30 and still

955
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,160
weren't out um and so I realized it's a

956
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,880
it's a journey for everybody but I think

957
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,480
being a leader is being yourself openly

958
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,119
so that you're just you know for the

959
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,920
21-year-old maybe that just started

960
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,920
working there they and maybe they are in

961
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,880
the closet they can kind of see oh I you

962
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,240
know this is an inclusive space thanks

963
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,640
Zoe So for our next question uh Austin

965
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,079

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,960
course anyone else can jump in um uh but

967
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,119

awesome thank you Lynette so in the

1011
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,040
interest of time I think we have uh

1012
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,800
opportunity for two more questions for

1013
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,400
our panelists I'll try and sneak in one

1014
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,000
more if I can before we get into uh

1015
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,480
closing out this evening's programming

1016
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,640
um but for this uh this next particular

1017
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,480
question um it's a two-parter so open to

1018
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,480
anybody um uh the first part is how did

1019
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,640
you find adjusting to the workspace as

1020
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,559
successful uh queer individuals um I've

1021
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,160
had different experiences depending on

1022
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,400
the workplace and I'm curious if you

1023
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,280
have any wisdom here and the second part

1024
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,559
of that question uh additionally how can

1025
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,800
I continue to stay engaged with the the

1026
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,839
Salone queer Network and Community

1027
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,839
during the application

1028
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,040
process so the other thing about slow

1029
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,920
that we're all pretty shy we' got you've

1030
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:02,160
got to way to be allocated a question to

1031
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,760
ask which is not difficulty for other

1032
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,400
business schools um I can take a step at

1033
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:12,400
this so um in terms I would say after I

1034
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,359
did become a lot more out um after SL

1035
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,599
and I think simar that's this is my

1036
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:18,920
first um I only started getting plugged

1037
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:23,800
into the career community at s and then

1038
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:25,960
since graduation um for before that um I

1039
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,760
think in the cas was very do tell

1040
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,319
consider UK kind of tell right but um

1041
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,680
yeah but people just that we didn't we

1042
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:36,559
talk about it um out in even out here in

1043
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,119
Singapore uh

1044
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:42,400
recently um my partner and I have also

1045
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,720
founded a quer business Collective um

1046
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,800
well when Singapore for queer business

1047
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,880
um Ro um lbq owners uh business owners

1048
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,640
in Singapore to kind of um Provide

1049
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,880
support and resources to each other so I

1050
00:46:53,640 --> 00:47:00,760
would say if if um

1051
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,240
if there's a gap in support or something

1052
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,920
in your experience at the workplace or

1053
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,079
whatever um create it uh there are

1054
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,800
people who would who would benefit from

1055
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,119
it as well who are willing to give back

1056
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,359
their timee and not now some of these

1057
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,920
books are are my closest friends um the

1058
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:21,240
second part of the

1059
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,240
question I believe was

1060
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:27,280
around the second part of the question

1061
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:31,000
um as a refresher was um in regards to

1062
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,800
staying connected with the uh slan uh

1063
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,480
Sloan pride and queer Community during

1064
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,480
the application

1065
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,680
process

1066
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,720
LinkedIn that's my yeah LinkedIn and uh

1067
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,319
I

1068
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:48,359
think might have some stuff around that

1069
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:51,319
as well sure so um we have um kind of

1070
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:54,160
like a Google form like for the um the

1071
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:57,440
any applicant to like get the connection

1072
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,480
with the this the pride students so like

1073
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,040
um if you like Google the storm pride

1074
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:05,440
and you will find um the the form so

1075
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,800
like you can get the connected with the

1076
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,800
the current

1077
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
students

1078
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,880
excellent all right we may have time to

1079
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,440
answer this one very quickly but this

1080
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,160
will be a great closing question um for

1081
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,240
our panelists if you could uh wind back

1082
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,520
the clock and start your time over again

1083
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,960
at Sloan

1084
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,960
uh what's one thing you would do

1085
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,440
differently I think for me um I knew I

1086
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,480
wanted to take a lot of Finance classes

1087
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,640
because ultimately I wanted my career to

1088
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,680
um to be in finance but as a you know a

1089
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,319
lot of the other panelists have

1090
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,240
mentioned there are so many other

1091
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:57,720
opportunities to um take classes outside

1092
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,880
of your interest or to cross

1093
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:03,280
or to take um classes outside of Sal at

1094
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,559
the rest of the Institute I did do that

1095
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,280
some but I certainly would have if I

1096
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:13,520
could go back um take classes you know

1097
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:16,599
totally outside of my already identified

1098
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,240
interests and just enjoy some of the

1099
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:21,640
access to the rest of the institute in

1100
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,640
Harvard and kind of the entire son

1101
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,640
experience

1102
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,720
yeah I think to double down on a point

1103
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,799
that Zoe made you know quite a bit

1104
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,680
earlier there's a level of exploration

1105
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:38,599
into to choose Point as well that is

1106
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,359
worth doing you know beyond that first

1107
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:42,880
semester you know think through anything

1108
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,559
that might potentially peque your

1109
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,040
interest whether it's through a club

1110
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,119
through a class or whatever it might be

1111
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,200
you know you know put your foot partly

1112
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,559
in that door um explore see what it

1113
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,760
might be because I might Peak an

1114
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:58,160
interest that you are surprised at

1115
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,880
peaked and that could lead to a a career

1116
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,680
shift that you didn't expect um you know

1117
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,200
I'd wished i' had done a little bit more

1118
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,960
of that exploration up up front versus

1119
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,520
maybe a little bit later on during my

1120
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,119
second year um but

1121
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:15,240
it to Drew's Point there's a lot to

1122
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,040
offer at MIT and at

1123
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,799
Sloan um and just utilize you know your

1124
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:25,119
time there your first year your second

1125
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:25,119
year to kind of like find that out

1126
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,319
Zoe Lynette anything to

1127
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:42,119
[Music]

1128
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:44,839
add I think these are great points um

1129
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,559
maybe one a lot of my friends were

1130
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:49,240
organizing conferences and I organized

1131
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:51,960
one conference our first impact

1132
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,319
investing one but I think I was like why

1133
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,680
why are people organizing conferences

1134
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:57,200
just seems like so much work and then it

1135
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,720
occurred to me now I was like like oh

1136
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,680
it's a great opportunity to get to meet

1137
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,000
really fantastic people uh and I don't

1138
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,400
know why that didn't occur to me as a

1139
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,920
student so um you know whatever area of

1140
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,280
interest you know we have so many

1141
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,400
different conferences like sports

1142
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,200
analytics impact investing

1143
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,640
sustainability and especially if you're

1144
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,240
trying to Pivot into a space or you're

1145
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,280
just curious um or help organize a

1146
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,440
conference like it's it's some work but

1147
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,480
then you get to meet phenomenal people

1148
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,559
and yeah I have no idea why that didn't

1149
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,559
occur to me as a student

1150
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,720
I'll throw in one more thing that we

1151
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,119
didn't cover um in this comp which is I

1152
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,280
would have gone out more okay I would

1153
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,839
have gone and I would have gone for more

1154
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,440
tracks um so I only I guess really

1155
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:44,240
learned to balance my time in the second

1156
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,079
year where so I was able to do that a

1157
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,799
lot more but these are essentially I

1158
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:51,200
mean the tracks are essentially trips

1159
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:55,720
organized by your fellow classmates who

1160
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,280
are locals so um in particular I went to

1161
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:02,880
I went to

1162
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:04,079
uh Mexico Brazil and Texas uh Houston um

1163
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,480
the different tracks and and the

1164
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,119
experience is different and I I don't

1165
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,119
think it's something that can really be

1166
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,520
replicated you also get a lot closer to

1167
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:14,319
your classmates during on a trip right

1168
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,319
so I think making time for that and of

1169
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,680
course the pride uh Retreats were

1170
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:23,640
absolutely my favorite um so making time

1171
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:26,359
for these socials uh activities and yeah

1172
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,119
um it's a great bonding to and to build

1173
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:29,680
uh

1174
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,440
relationships with folks who are who are

1175
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,440
going to be your friends for life
