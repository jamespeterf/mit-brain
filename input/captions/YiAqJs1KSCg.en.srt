1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
hello computational musicologists and

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,879
music

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,560
theorists while you're working on your

4
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,119
own representation formats I want to

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,400
introduce one representation format

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,599
indeed the most commonly used

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,560
representation format for common western

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,439
music notation scores and that is music

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
XML created by Michael good around the

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,120
year

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,600
2000 looking over at the music XML

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,840
website we can see their version of

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,200
hello world as you know in programming

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,280
Traditions it's become traditional to

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,399
print out the word hello world to show

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,640
how uh a how a programming language

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,760
Works in music notation it's become

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,600
common to instead to show how uh note

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,079
middle C uh would be represented whole

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,719
note or something like that and here is

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,000
the example of that middle C whole note

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,000
in music XML one of the things you can

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,360
see in music XML just like any XML or

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,159
like HTML we have these things called

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,680
Tags which are enclosed in angle

26
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,079
brackets then we have a content for the

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,079
tag and then the tag is closed with

28
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:27,840
those same angle brackets with a slash

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,200
front tags can enclose other tags so the

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,920
score part encloses a tag called called

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,200
part name and then it's closed later and

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,360
tags can also have attributes ID equals

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,479
P1 and we'll look at those in just a

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,640
little

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,680
bit let's scroll down to the note so all

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,560
of that is to set up what we might

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,520
normally do for a note so a note is a

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,200
tag called note within it there's a tag

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,880
called pitch within that there's a tag

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,920
called step and the step has a single

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,799
letter this this is very similar to

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,880
music 21 in fact you I borrowed these

43
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,319
Concepts from here and um so that the

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,360
accidental would be encoded elsewhere

45
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,920
then the octave is encoded as a single

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,560
number then the pitch is

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,480
closed after that we have a duration tag

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,239
and we'll get back to that in a second

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,480
but it's duration 4 and then there's

50
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,760
something called a type which is

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,480
different and it says whole so it says

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,840
that this note type is a whole

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,080
note we have the duration and the type

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,120
encoded separately because the type

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,440
explains to notation software how to

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,720
represent this note what it should look

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:53,080
like and um the duration instead tells

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,800
it how long it is so you could in theory

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,040
put a a duration of any number and a

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,760
type of any number and you can make

61
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,440
things that look looked very different

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,000
from how they sounded or how they were

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,360
represented in practice most notation

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,239
software reads one or the other of these

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,080
so that's kind of too bad uh the

66
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,280
duration four does not like in music 21

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,560
rep uh represent necessarily four

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,519
quarter notes what it does is it refers

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,040
back to the last tag within an

70
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,280
attributes tag called divisions and this

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,879
says how many parts should uh should a

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,680
quarter note be divided up into two so

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,640
in this case because the only note is a

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
whole note we can just divide up the

75
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,239
cord note into one part not divide it at

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,040
all and then say a whole note has four

77
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,439
of these um but if we were going to

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,280
later have an eighth note then this

79
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,280
would have to be at least two because

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,760
the quarter note can be divided into two

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,920
parts if we might have 16th notes it

82
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,360
would need to be four because it could

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,400
be divided into four parts and if we

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,200
were going to have 16 notes and triplets

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,640
also then it would need to be 12 because

86
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,720
you can divide it into 12 different ways

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,519
um in practice these divisions usually

88
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,600
end up being much higher numbers uh some

89
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,519
people use 16 384 which is you know a

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,520
power of two I like using a high power

91
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,360
of two multipli by three multiplied by

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,520
five multiplied by seven so I can

93
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,680
exactly represent triplets quets sep

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,840
cupets things like that but you can

95
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,960
change this division um with each I

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,280
think at least each measure so that you

97
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,479
can make sure that whatever you're going

98
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,680
to be representing will be there we can

99
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,759
also see that there's a key signature

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,280
and that's um marked in the number of

101
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,720
fifths from from C so remember your

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,280
circle fifths if you want a key

103
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,720
signature of D major of two sharps that

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,680
would be two if you want uh B major that

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,759
should be five if you want F major well

106
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
we're going the other way so that's

107
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,000
going to be negative -1 so we can

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,000
represent keys that way time you can

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,320
probably figure out beats and beat type

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,360
or 44 could be called numerator and

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,919
denominator but it is one of these

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:25,000
things about uh about music XML that the

113
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:27,520
format likes to uh likes to show the um

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,120
the musical meaning not just you know

115
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,440
how it's going to be laid out we have

116
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,919
the C

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,560
instead of saying it's trouble cff we

118
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:39,960
say that it is a gclf online

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,759
too and so here is some of the um basics

120
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,240
of musicxml you can go to music xml.com

121
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,880
and read more about this we're going to

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,400
look at a few other components of Music

123
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,280
XML before going on but we don't you not

124
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,360
necessarily need to learn everything

125
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,840
about it

126
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,520
um so for looking at how music XML Works

127
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,400
we're going to look at us slightly more

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,720
complex example than just a single

129
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,759
coordin note we have a vocal part and

130
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,520
then a piano part represented on two

131
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:18,280
staves here we're using a divisions

132
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,160
that's a higher number than one U minor3

133
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,880
for the key signature and then we can

134
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,840
explicitly encode that it's actually

135
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,759
minor so we're not in E Flat Major or in

136
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,440
c minor right um

137
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,360
there's transposition but we don't need

138
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,240
to know that for this the pitch element

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,160
the note element sorry to say sorry can

140
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,759
also have um have Ties on it and can

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,479
have lyrics we can say that this is an

142
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,440
end of a syllable that ends M and we end

143
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,240
an extension this is another thing you

144
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,479
can do in XML based formats if you want

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
to open a tag and immediately close it

146
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,120
you can just put a slash at the end

147
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,240
instead

148
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,599
we look at tide notes even though uh

149
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,000
it's just a little little thing and that

150
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:13,680
is that there are two different parts in

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,199
a tie note in music XML and for a number

152
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,240
of things in music XML there is the Tie

153
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,080
element which

154
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,039
represents um conceptually is this note

155
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,840
tied and then there is the tide with a d

156
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:32,039
element and that says how do we draw the

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,639
tie on the page so you can draw a tie

158
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,240
without having a note that sounds tied

159
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,319
or is conceived of as tied or you could

160
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,240
have science conceived of as tied but

161
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,840
not

162
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,800
drawing and this shows up in other

163
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,680
places namely in uh in accidentals

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,039
because you can imagine a B flat you

165
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,199
conceive of it as a B flat but you also

166
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,759
put a flat sign in front of it the next

167
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,080
B in that same measure you cance of it

168
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,240
as B flat but you don't put a flat sign

169
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,840
in front of it so there's a distinction

170
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,759
between how we represent a note on paper

171
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,039
and how we can see of it and this is

172
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,440
very important

173
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,360
also we can look over here at chords and

174
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,199
see that a chord is simply here's a

175
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,199
three note chord we start with a note

176
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:27,240
it's a c um C and octave 4 and then we

177
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,840
have the next note has this empty chord

178
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,120
tag that says it's part of a chord of

179
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,880
the previous note so in music XML if you

180
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,839
want to know whether something is a

181
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,479
chord uh you won't know it from the

182
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,880
first note you'll only know it from the

183
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,560
second note odd here is an example where

184
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,760
we have E flat altered by negative -1

185
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,760
semmit tones and then the next note

186
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,920
G here's a little example of multi part

187
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:02,959
music and especially this part where we

188
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,079
have two different voices in the same

189
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,920
measure so we have two chords that can

190
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:11,320
be represented as just a single um sort

191
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,600
of set of note elements and then we have

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,480
chord here and chord here but in between

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,200
we have this separate voice with

194
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,959
separate stem directions and so on one

195
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,399
of the things that music 20 uh music XML

196
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,200
does is that when you get to a certain

197
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,839
point you're reading through all of your

198
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,440
durations are all considered to be in a

199
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,839
low row you get to maybe the end of

200
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,320
measure and you can back up a certain

201
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
number of

202
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,079
Divisions and then you can go forward

203
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,120
again in this case you would probably

204
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,519
just back up eight but a lot of notation

205
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
software seems to only use backup to go

206
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,279
to the beginning of the measure and then

207
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,920
if you need to skip forward use a

208
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,480
forward

209
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,320
again and it is also customary um though

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,680
not strictly required I don't believe

211
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,240
but almost um a lot of notation uh

212
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,519
things that read music XL we call them

213
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,680
consumers of Music XML a lot of them

214
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,079
might uh have a problem or might crash

215
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,360
if you don't include what's customary

216
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,959
again then you end at the end of the

217
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,360
measure by going forward until the very

218
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,959
end there's all kinds of other things on

219
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,079
repeats on sound suggestion so on but

220
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,959
one of the things you can see is that

221
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,680
compared to some of the thoughts we had

222
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,839
on compact

223
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,519
representations music XML is very

224
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,839
verbose it takes up a lot of space on

225
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,760
the screen it takes up a good amount of

226
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,279
space on disk though not nearly as much

227
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,519
as this uh video would ever take so

228
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:44,639
there is a compressed format and we call

229
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:47,800
it MXL we call XML orm musicxml the file

230
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:52,120
extension for standard music XML format

231
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,839
and uh MXL if it's just gzipped and

232
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,959
right now we're working on way so that a

233
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,360
gzip archive can include the score maybe

234
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:02,000
a compressed score a a transpose score

235
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,959
also all of the parts so new things are

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,839
still coming out with music XML and we

237
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:13,079
will turn to learning more about music

238
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,079
XML from the Creator
