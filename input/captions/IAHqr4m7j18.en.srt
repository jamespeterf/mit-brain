1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:09,280
okay um let's start our last session of

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,880
today um so um we have uh Professor

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,920
Jacob uh he's a assist associate

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,199
professor in um um at the Department of

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,439
Mathematics and computer science at

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,800
Aloma University of Technology in

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,599
Netherlands and he's also the gener head

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,000
of the generative AI group there and um

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,480
okay uh can you pull up the slide please

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,040
yeah so um and today um uh so um I'm

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,360
sure that you'll um uh before we pull up

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,480
the slide uh I just want to um just say

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,760
that uh if you have any question you can

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,520
feel free to come up to the the speaker

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,719
uh the two microphones here and okay so

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,399
now we have the slides available right

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,960
and is this your uh not yet not yet not

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,399
yet okay um yeah uh so after this we'll

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,079
have a poster session and networking

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:06,159
with uh we have a re

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,960
um you feel free to um stay and enjoy um

22
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,960
um networking with your fellow

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:15,119
colleagues um I think um there's um lot

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,720
of exciting talk today um kind of uh

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,799
span across you know small molecule drug

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,680
Discovery and we'll um also have we also

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,079
have some um our Kyo speaker on a

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,280
protein design and we will have um we

29
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,640
are kind of trying to sample across

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,560
different drug modalities and and um

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,040
okay so and without further Ado uh I

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,119
would like to just leave the stage to

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,600
you yeah thank you very much so first of

34
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,119
all thank you for the invitation it's

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,119
great to be here it's the first time for

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,320
me in Boston so it's it's really great

37
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:51,520
place and uh uh I am actually a computer

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,159
scientist I work on generative modeling

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,360
generative AI for over 10 years so

40
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,960
before the hype I think it's good to

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,200
mention that these

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,960
days uh and also I happen to be a

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,880
program chair of newbs this year so I

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,759
really liked all the comments in the

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,360
morning a bit sour comments it's

46
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,239
actually good to listen to them as well

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,760
uh and I hope that I can also meet you

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,040
in Vancouver this year or maybe the next

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,879
year uh and so as I said so I'm a

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,120
computer scientist I'm not a biologist

51
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm not a chemist I'm not a physicist so

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,440
you can very easily kill me with any

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,640
simple question probably but I will try

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,640
to do my best to tell you a little bit

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,720
about how we can use generative AI to

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,440
accelerate drug Discovery so a little

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,000
bit different perspective so we listen

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:43,319
to many many different uh aspects

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,280
already today um and uh I will try to to

60
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,840
point out a few other interesting

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,319
applications in my opinion right so

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,120
first I would like to say a few words

63
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,400
that you probably know about it but it's

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,239
good to always start with why right and

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,360
first why is uh uh very shameful serf

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,120
advertisement so I I I

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,640
just finish my second edition of my book

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,959
on on deep generative modeling and uh

69
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,480
for me gen geni is not not equivalent to

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,080
llms it's really about probabilistic

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,959
modeling so I really loved how Jennifer

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,200
said in the morning that it's about

73
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,400
density density about probability

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,440
distributions because this is exactly

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,040
what generative AI generative modeling

76
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,840
is right and uh we talk about geni it's

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,879
actually about parameterizing

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,439
probabilistic models with deep neural

79
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,799
networks right and we have many many

80
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,360
different classes of deep generative

81
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,519
models SL gen models like what we

82
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,560
listened today already so diffusion

83
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,680
models um latent variable models energy

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,519
based models Auto aggressive models like

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,640
llms nowadays right and also maybe what

86
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,360
is not mentioned here is uh the another

87
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,400
class of so-called Foundation

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,760
models that are not necessarily

89
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,400
probabilistic models but they can use to

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,040
to to build more sophisticated

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,799
generative AI

92
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,959
systems and uh talking about drug

93
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,519
Discovery so like focusing on the R&D

94
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,199
part so of course this is always very

95
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,000
lengthy uh very costly process right and

96
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,040
from Target identification and

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,360
validation to lead identification and

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,320
optimization in vitro studies and so on

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
so on so on right so there are many many

100
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,759
many aspects of

101
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:41,680
R&D uh before even any drug candidate

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,240
enters clinical trials right so where I

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,160
see a computer scientist right where I

104
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,240
see that gen can help uh in this process

105
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,680
so of course at this R&D especially

106
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,759
right so probably I I again I don't need

107
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,240
to convince you about it the hope is

108
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,280
that we can shorten all this this pretty

109
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,039
lengthy

110
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,639
processes and as and as an outcome we

111
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:11,199
can get something faster as well and and

112
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:14,639
and and cheaper right we saw multiple uh

113
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,479
talks today multiple great uh success

114
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,280
stories actually right uh and uh but I

115
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,919
what I want to highlight is that we can

116
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,759
use broadly speaking gen AI not only to

117
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,240
get for instance molecules but we can

118
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,240
also use it at different places so for

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,080
instance we can use for Target

120
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,319
identification and validation we also

121
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,639
listen to that today uh and also for

122
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,720
understanding mechanisms why something

123
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:47,080
happens what how a given given

124
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,319
disease evolves because generative

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,440
modeling we need to remember is about

126
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,199
actually generative

127
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,759
processes we can say that this is in

128
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,600
some sense how we think our reality is

129
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,240
like we can Sample about our reality

130
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,840
right so what is like what kind of

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,599
condition what is conditioning what is

132
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,360
condition on on this and so on so on

133
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,680
right so this is like a generative

134
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,319
process uh but also of course we can use

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,680
gen for do NOA drag design so I said we

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,720
listen to that maybe some phenotypic

137
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,720
profiling etc

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,319
etc and so what we can do with

139
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Gen uh again so we can look at this uh

140
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,199
in different from different angles so

141
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,919
one we can use gen for Target

142
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,080
acquisition or like for instance with

143
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,479
Alpha fault or

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,639
Rosetta uh it's good to remember that

145
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,160
there is not only alpha alpha fault

146
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,120
right so there are also other approaches

147
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,919
uh we can also use data analysis so

148
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,120
sequencing data Imaging data network

149
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:56,039
data simulation data there are plenty of

150
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:59,639
amazing simulators that can help us with

151
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,479
uh yeah understanding what are the the

152
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,879
the mechanism under the hoood of of

153
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,319
given disease for instance and of course

154
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:09,720
we can use gen for molecular docking the

155
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,800
NOA drug design but also we can look at

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,960
some properties so this is what I I I

157
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,360
will try to cover to some extent today

158
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,840
so for instance about uh enzyme kinetics

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,560
right so we can also use gen for that we

160
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,440
can help Chemists in wet Labs we can

161
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,720
help them with some tools that that

162
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,680
speed up uh they work work right so this

163
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,960
is very interesting and there are pretty

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
old Concepts actually but they come back

165
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,960
so very

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,319
recently uh many researchers from

167
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,240
Stanford John Zuckerberg initiative they

168
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,199
they they they they they published a

169
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,919
paper on archive about virtual cells

170
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,800
organisms so to to create something in

171
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,639
silic like an organist or a cell in

172
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,280
silico that such that we can play with

173
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,159
without even touching anything in a wet

174
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,520
lab right so this is of course very very

175
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:10,159
challenging task because if you look at

176
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,240
a cell it is like extremely complicated

177
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,919
system by itself and yet we we have

178
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,400
organis that consist of this cells so

179
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,919
are built of this cell so this is like

180
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,520
crazily complex right but so this is

181
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,520
very interesting uh uh where we can use

182
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,479
AI actually right in so many different

183
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,640
places so okay so how we can how we can

184
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,039
use a gen so first I would like to start

185
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,360
with one example of uh understanding

186
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,839
regulatory mechanism of diseases so this

187
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,279
is a project that I'm I'm involved in uh

188
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,000
with a startup in Amsterdam in the

189
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,600
Netherlands so the idea is that by

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,760
Regulators we mean some natural

191
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,040
compounds that control biochemical uh

192
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:00,000
reactions uh and disregulation results

193
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,640
in let's say disease right uh

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,519
or some unhealthy State an example is

195
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,920
vitamin

196
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:13,200
B12 again what is in this uh uh in this

197
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,760
block so I can't fully comprehend but uh

198
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,920
for me what is important is that input

199
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,000
is uh like some deficiency of vitamin

200
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,279
B12 and output is anemia right so

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,839
basically the first and the last word

202
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,959
here and but there is a some complete

203
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
system that we can actually understand

204
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,839
biochemists can understand and explain

205
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,720
it pretty well but this is exactly what

206
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,079
we mean what we mean by

207
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,440
regulators and so we can actually look

208
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,680
at diseases from this perspective well

209
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,079
maybe perhaps instead of Designing uh a

210
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,920
drug we can first look and we can try to

211
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,720
understand why a disease occures right

212
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,320
maybe we can be lucky enough to find

213
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,680
that there is some uh compound that is

214
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,000
this natural compound that regulates

215
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,000
some process right and then based on

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,240
that we can start optimizing that and

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,680
this is the approach that we uh we use

218
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,240
for very challenging uh problem of

219
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,120
Alzheimer's and we used a database of

220
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,480
over

221
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:23,360
220,000 uh candidates Regulators that

222
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,920
that that are naturally occurring our

223
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,959
bodies and we used generative AI based

224
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,240
on deep learning uh so some Foundation

225
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:36,240
models we created a pipeline in-house

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,760
pipeline uh that allowed us to actually

227
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,839
highlight some potential leads then of

228
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,720
course it's not don't get me wrong I am

229
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,240
a huge Enthusiast of AI but uh of course

230
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,120
at the end or in this process must be

231
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,760
Human Being Human expert right So

232
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,240
eventually medicinal chemist looked at

233
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,480
this potential candidate and said yes we

234
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,720
see in this list some potential uh

235
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,839
candidat right then further it was

236
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,440
optimized in a wet lab but at least this

237
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:11,959
this uh uh this step was definitely much

238
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,839
faster than studying literature of for

239
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,920
this

240
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,079
220,000 potential compounds and so on so

241
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,920
on so we can uh make it more automatic

242
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,639
right so this is first example very

243
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,000
interesting in my

244
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,800
opinion uh another example is uh like

245
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,120
let's say this was the very beginning of

246
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,959
the whole pipeline of drug Discovery now

247
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,959
we are entering like this almost like

248
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,639
preclinical uh step right so let's say

249
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:43,480
that we have uh identified some

250
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,560
inhibitor or a candidate uh drug

251
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,040
candidate and now we need to check

252
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,560
different uh properties right uh so for

253
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,279
instance enzyme kinetics is one of those

254
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,800
steps uh so like the M Menan model right

255
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,560
so let's say that we like you know more

256
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,279
how how it works than me but there is a

257
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,839
system of differential equations this is

258
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,639
what I understand at least and uh what

259
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,959
we have to do we have to check how

260
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,279
enzyme behaves with and without uh

261
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,399
potential inhibitor we try different

262
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,760
concentration levels right and this is

263
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,560
the the most basic approach this is the

264
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,920
the a right so this is this let's

265
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,639
so-called standard approach you try

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,480
different concentrations you you measure

267
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,360
it you you make the mement and plot and

268
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,399
then you get your uh parameters right

269
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,320
values you estimate your

270
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:41,480
parameters so our question was can we do

271
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,079
it faster by just having one single

272
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,160
measurement instead of multiple like

273
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,079
typically eight or so right so then we

274
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:54,279
of course don't waste money for startups

275
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,760
is super important we don't waste time

276
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,639
again for startups super important right

277
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,279
and then maybe we can get very quickly

278
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,800
ER some uh maybe rough but at least some

279
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,800
estimate right of the value so this is

280
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,040
what we use so I call it like a local

281
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,399
model because this is like for one given

282
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,160
case we can use some computational uh

283
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,440
models so here we use approximate ban

284
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,160
computation uh so you can use

285
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,440
uh if we bend the definitions a little

286
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,800
bit gen for that right uh and this is

287
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,880
this approach gives you very quickly

288
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,079
some

289
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:37,600
posterior over your parameter value

290
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:40,440
right for this enzyme paramet entics

291
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:45,000
parameters

292
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:49,240
so does it work well we applied it to uh

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,320
to uh to the case of uh

294
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,680
uh uh

295
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,440
covid-19 so with this approach uh we

296
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,600
were able to actually very quickly check

297
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,880
something and put a paper on bio archive

298
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,079
uh two months after the first uh First

299
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,680
cases in the Netherlands right so it was

300
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,759
like around March and in in uh in in may

301
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,279
we already had some first uh write up

302
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,000
right and this was possible because

303
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,240
actually we applied this computational

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,839
approach so we really sped up everything

305
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,839
and then uh the paper was then late

306
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,440
published one year later right because

307
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,959
we had to do everything properly but at

308
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,839
least it helped to very quickly navigate

309
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,560
to say hey it's actually Worth to pursue

310
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,680
right and after all this is what we do

311
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,720
care about right we want to quickly

312
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,079
proceed uh like you know like I always

313
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,519
joke that uh in AI if a paper is one

314
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,240
month old it's pretty old if it's one

315
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:56,880
year old it's like ages old right so I

316
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,320
think it's getting like that everywhere

317
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,240
right in in uh in Medicinal Chemistry

318
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,720
it's getting similar

319
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,639
right uh so this is uh uh this is an

320
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,360
example that actually we can we can use

321
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:14,759
that uh and very recently so this is a

322
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,720
preliminary uh works it's unpublished

323
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,839
very

324
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,240
preliminary again with enzyme

325
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:25,560
kinetics and what we try to use here we

326
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,040
try to look at the problem as uh time

327
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,240
series forecasting SL generating right

328
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Right Time series and the case is here

329
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,560
that uh we assume that we don't know for

330
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,440
a second that there are some ODS there

331
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,279
is some m m model we just have some

332
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,480
measurements so what we can have we can

333
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,680
have uh substrate concentration enzyme

334
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,519
concentration and then we observe uh the

335
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,240
curve for product right how it changes

336
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,079
over time right and we can phrase it in

337
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,240
in two ways so first we can say that hey

338
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,759
we have some initial measurements and we

339
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,680
stop it right and we say now given those

340
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,680
data this and this concentration initial

341
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,839
concentrations predict the remaining of

342
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,720
this curve right it could be useful but

343
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,600
typically we are more interested in

344
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,319
another scenario that we only have the

345
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,480
initial condition for the product which

346
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,680
is zero and we don't do any measurements

347
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,959
in the wet lab and we want to generate

348
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,199
or predict the remaining of this time

349
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,480
series right

350
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,319
uh and I'm for our initial experiments

351
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,959
we use M Menan model to generate like

352
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:41,240
synthetic data but of course in practice

353
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,000
we can say that hey we are now agnostic

354
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,199
to to this enzyme kinetics model under

355
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,560
the hood it could be anything just

356
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,480
provide me a lot of data also this is if

357
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,560
this

358
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,480
works it it has this very nice property

359
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,040
that since this is a deep learning based

360
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:05,000
model we can can now add many other

361
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,600
modalities right so we with Odes we need

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,799
to stick to Odes with deep learning

363
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,559
models we can attach many different

364
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:15,199
components and and as I said modalities

365
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,240
so for instance we can now give uh

366
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,679
structures of enzyme and ligant and we

367
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,839
can train such a model right so but

368
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,120
first comes first so first we wanted to

369
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,760
check if even uh this this neural

370
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,960
network based approach works

371
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,120
and in the first case we are pretty

372
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,720
positive that it will work in the second

373
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,840
case we were something like probably it

374
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:45,480
won't work right I as a I work with my

375
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,919
PhD student as a good supervisor I said

376
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:53,360
it probably won't work but let's give it

377
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:57,919
a try anyway right and uh additionally

378
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,520
so we wanted to check if giving this

379
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,679
initial condition

380
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,159
give some uh information it should

381
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,280
because this is how the the OD works

382
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:10,559
right but we wanted to check it as well

383
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,960
we picked like state-of-the-art

384
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,520
model again state-ofthe-art in terms of

385
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,960
uh AI it's bit tricky so in April they

386
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,520
were state-ofthe-art not anymore but

387
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,600
they were pretty good and so these are

388
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,480
some results uh by the way I hate

389
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,760
looking at tables but this is the only

390
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,720
table here so so bear with me so so if

391
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,120
we this scenario one is this let's say

392
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,679
we have more information and scenario

393
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,480
two is that we don't give any

394
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,600
information of the of previous

395
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,240
measurements right and so if we don't

396
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,480
use any external information so we only

397
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,480
give uh no initial conditions are given

398
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,159
uh so the model performs extremely

399
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,000
bad which is a very good information for

400
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,360
us because when we uh give this

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,360
information initial conditions suddenly

402
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,000
everything works pretty well right and

403
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,559
here is some very chped

404
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,720
example

405
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,120
uh yeah sorry so this is actually

406
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,600
scenario one I mix mixed them up so this

407
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,320
is scenario one so if we you give some

408
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,760
initial information it is capable of

409
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,640
predicting uh everything very well uh if

410
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,240
you don't give this external information

411
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,159
the the prediction is pretty bad and

412
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,919
then uh as I said so this is unpublished

413
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,120
so unfortunately I don't want to show

414
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,880
too many information uh with you s guys

415
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,280
but uh if now we we updated the model in

416
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,240
some way and first of all it worked

417
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,720
better in this scenario one but also

418
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,679
worked better in this scenario two and

419
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,280
this is actually very very interesting

420
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:52,200
and very promising and this is actually

421
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,840
how uh like I think that very skilled uh

422
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,520
uh specialist expert would work so how

423
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,679
it works it like if you give initial

424
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,120
conditions and if you know a bit how

425
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,200
this OD works so the the initial uh

426
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,919
value of the substrate will be the upper

427
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Bound for the maximum of the product

428
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,919
right because

429
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,080
of well you cannot get more product than

430
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,480
your initial substrate right so then

431
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,600
what we notice is that exactly by giving

432
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,880
this information so you can see that

433
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:28,240
this this uh or this this green and and

434
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,640
red so these two curves so they exactly

435
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,480
like go to the the to the maximum right

436
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,880
if you don't give this initial condition

437
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,000
for a substrate the model goes

438
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,360
completely bananas right it it goes

439
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,320
somewhere and we notice that by giving

440
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,280
this external information so this model

441
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,400
worked a little bit like that it figured

442
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,159
out the curve so it was always something

443
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,000
like this this logarithmic let's say

444
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,559
right and then by giving these

445
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,440
conditions it was just shifting it up or

446
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,480
down and then when we discuss that we

447
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,280
realized that probably this is how we

448
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,520
would work let's say you are given 1,000

449
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,159
examples you see that all these curves

450
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,720
are a little bit like that and then by

451
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,240
having different initial conditions you

452
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,679
just move them up or down so you have

453
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,919
something like an average of your curve

454
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,760
and then you're moving up and down and

455
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,279
this is actually very cool because now

456
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,679
maybe if we give extra information like

457
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,360
for instance what is the structure of

458
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,799
your enzyme what is structure of your

459
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,480
compound maybe the model will start

460
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:33,559
figuring out the Dynamics like the Cur

461
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,080
the the the rate right so maybe it will

462
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:39,320
start moving left or right so this is

463
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,799
like this is our stage at this point so

464
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,480
we are working on that I think it's

465
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,360
super super

466
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,799
interesting uh and it can like at the

467
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:53,080
end of the day if we can create this

468
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:55,520
let's say foundation/ gen model that you

469
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,120
don't need to run in a wet lab you can

470
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
run on your laptop it's like amazing

471
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,039
right because you can very quickly

472
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,279
verify for given enzyme and compound

473
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,880
what is the enzyme kinetics of

474
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,039
that right and the last example sorry

475
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,600
when I'm getting excited I don't know

476
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,200
how much time do I have I I should

477
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,120
finish probably yeah all right sorry so

478
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,840
very quickly so this is about mechanics

479
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:26,360
of action uh uh so phenotypic profiling

480
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,159
with images so we used a data set that

481
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,440
was actually uh prepared here here in in

482
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,120
Broad

483
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:38,279
Institute and this is an example of uh

484
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:41,440
like a follow-up paper of uh a platform

485
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,760
or framework that we developed earlier

486
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,279
in Amsterdam at the University of

487
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,640
Amsterdam on attention-based multi-

488
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,880
instance learning for histopathology

489
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,159
slide we use it for for other data uh

490
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,240
and we used uh like pre-trained

491
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,840
embedding model so like a foundation

492
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,200
model on top of which we created a a ban

493
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,400
model right not going into the details

494
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,520
what was interesting is that oh sorry

495
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
another table I li to you so there are

496
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,720
two tables in this presentation another

497
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:16,159
table so we have uh obviously sorry guys

498
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,559
like AI spirit in me so we we got

499
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,520
state-ofthe-art

500
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:22,240
obviously uh H but what was interesting

501
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,559
is that because it has this attention

502
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,919
mechanism for everyone who is familiar

503
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,039
with attention mechanism so we can

504
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,039
actually use attention mechanism to

505
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,919
highlight which uh parts of the input

506
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:40,559
are important or not so where the model

507
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:44,279
uh puts some emphasis on and our model

508
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,080
this is uh it looks like a chair picked

509
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:50,039
it was but in general it it worked

510
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,919
pretty pretty this the same way so you

511
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:56,279
can see that actually our model put a

512
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,960
lot of emphasis on these small images

513
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,320
with some cells inside

514
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,640
and put very low for the background

515
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,720
basically so this is again how you would

516
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:12,240
expect this model to work right so

517
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,720
really really interesting uh part and so

518
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,520
to conclude I I I don't want to go

519
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,520
through that but in my opinion this is

520
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,760
very interesting how we can use gen for

521
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,399
really different applications not

522
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,399
necessarily only molecule generation but

523
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:33,600
really in many many other a part of the

524
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:36,919
the pipeline and I personally I believe

525
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,440
that this virtual cells organis is like

526
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,399
probably the way to go i' would like to

527
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,600
thank everyone and if you are

528
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:47,120
interesting we can talk more and uh in a

529
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,440
month I'm I'm moving to San Francisco

530
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,279
I'm joining Chan Zuckerberg uh

531
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,520
initiative so maybe we can also

532
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:58,520
collaborate in this

533
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,520
continent thanks

534
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:05,200
all right thank you so much uh given the

535
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,880
time maybe can we have one question uh

536
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,360
if you have uh can you uh come to the

537
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,279
stage while maybe um um can you the ab

538
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,440
team can you set up U put on J and the

539
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:22,279
zoom on the on the screen thank

540
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:26,120
you uh hi hi was it yeah hi my name is

541
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:29,039
no from Brown University uh I don't know

542
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,720
much about like enzyme kinetics but I've

543
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,240
seen your model I don't know why you

544
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,520
call it generative AI because it's more

545
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,960
like neural operator or like the

546
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,559
foundation model yeah but uh I I have a

547
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,799
question that what is the input of your

548
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:47,799
model that you get get the kinetics

549
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,520
right so thank you very good question so

550
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:54,840
indeed uh it's a little bit how you look

551
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,159
at the problem so like in general time

552
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,520
series forecasting is a perfect example

553
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,720
of an autoaggressive mod model and an

554
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,360
autoaggressive model is a generative

555
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,679
model but I'm not so like you know to me

556
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,840
it's tomato tomato a bit so you can call

557
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,200
it whatever you want right uh but uh

558
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,480
what is different here is because I saw

559
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,880
your poster by the way so very cool uh

560
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:23,200
one so it's a we we assume that we don't

561
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,720
know what is the OD so we don't use this

562
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,559
neural OD kind of ideas yes we really

563
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,679
want to be like fully data uh like uh

564
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,080
what is the input of your model is it

565
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:39,360
like the like initial conditions and

566
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,960
maybe some the parameters of the model

567
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,000
no no no no no we don't know we don't

568
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,320
know the parameters that's why it's not

569
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,960
working so well maybe right uh but we

570
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,159
have only the initial conditions and

571
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,720
part of your time series and that's it

572
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,720
so you don't know what is under the

573
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,760
hoood I see of course if we know it and

574
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,000
we should use it so this is but this is

575
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,120
for our future work yeah thank you so

576
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,799
much I have a similar work on like the

577
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,919
uh effect of the drug on two more growth

578
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,840
so we have state space model Mamba for

579
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,279
predicting the efficacy so in that case

580
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,039
we have like more feature uh and not

581
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:23,640
initial at all but like more feature

582
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,559
about the patient nice very cool I I

583
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,480
will come back very interesting talk

584
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,559
thank you thank you thank you very much

585
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,120
okay yeah with uh let's give the speaker

586
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,120
one more round of applause
