00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,040
hello computational music

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,240
researchers we're going to continue our

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,960
study of corpora and what we can do with

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,279
the Corpus of music by talking about

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,439
some research that I did with Sophia H

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:34,680
Sun who was a visiting student at MIT in

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:37,520
2006 to 2017 and graduated in 2018 from

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,079
Wellsley College we've published our

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,480
work as emotion painting lyric affect

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,879
and musical relationships and a large Le

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,960
cheet

12
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,079
Corpus so this is work that's about

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,600
looking at a large musical Corpus and

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,000
also looking at words and how music and

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,559
words

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,480
interact words and musical moments are

17
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,480
generally both felt to have intrinsic

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,000
emotions

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,760
but while the emotional context of text

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,200
is determined at least in part from the

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,320
semantics that is the meaning of

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,560
individual words and sentences the

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,159
emotional content of individual musical

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,080
parameters is far less well

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,000
defined this lack of definition is

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,360
especially acute in written musical

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,079
scores that are separated from the oral

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
and visual components of particular

29
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,600
performances or

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
recordings so a major question for music

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,119
perception or the psychology of music is

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,600
is do particular musical features such

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,040
as consonants and dissonants beat

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,479
placement and Pitch height when they

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,920
separated from the performative elements

36
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,960
do they still carry particular emotional

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,600
meanings such as acceleration or

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,320
sadness it might not be possible to

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,640
answer such a question directly but we

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,240
can approach the answer indirectly by

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,000
asking are there musical features that

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,680
are used in conjunction with texts and

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
are associated with particular

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
sentiments or emotions with such

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,599
regularity that we might believe that

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,120
the musical features themselves are used

47
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,920
to to strengthen the effect of these

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,280
affects and emotions or do they indeed

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,800
carry that affect or emotion

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,560
themselves the problem with making such

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,720
connections with the traditional musical

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,920
analysis is that there's no perfect

53
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,000
correlation between any musical feature

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,239
and any emotional state

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
we might think at least in Western

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,800
common practice tradition that words

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,040
conting Joy would tend to be higher in

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,440
Pitch than the notes around them or the

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,239
notes preceding it and it's easy to find

60
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,599
examples to confirm this theory in

61
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,800
Schubert's Gretchen on SPID Rod or

62
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,159
Gretchen at the spinning wheel one of

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,680
his leads every single time the word

64
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,239
hers which is the German for heart

65
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,959
appears or

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,080
smile or zor magic your cuse kiss it's

67
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,879
always at the same pitch height or

68
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,760
higher than the preceding note and

69
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,760
always in the upper register for the

70
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:27,620
[Music]

71
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,040
singer so it might sound like this is an

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,799
easy connection but then a little bit of

73
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,640
Elvis enters into your head but

74
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,400
I

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,120
can't

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,120
help falling in

77
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,840
[Music]

78
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,480
love in this song by Elvis originally

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,959
written by George Weiss and others

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,120
called can't help falling in

81
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:09,120
love we always hear the words love and

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,439
darling below the previous note even in

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,360
an expression as magistic or the full

84
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,959
word painting as

85
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:23,320
falling even that is set with a rising

86
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,639
motion so this says that individual

87
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,479
pieces some here and some there might

88
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,960
have clear relationships among text and

89
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,440
emotion and musical features teachers

90
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,680
but across a large Corpus the aggregated

91
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,759
experience of listening to common

92
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,680
practice or folk or popular music is far

93
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,680
more

94
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,720
muddled to clarify this we can turn to

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,880
Corpus studies especially computational

96
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,400
analysis of large repertories of musical

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,039
encoded data sets whose sheer volume

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,039
makes it impossible for human

99
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,600
researchers to analyze all these pieces

100
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,840
manually with comput methods for

101
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,680
extracting connections among music text

102
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,160
and emotion we can find statistically

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,360
significant Trends in music a

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,199
relationships that stand out from a

105
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,639
large Corpus even if the magnitude of

106
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
the trend itself is quite

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,720
small Sophia's son and I used a

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,720
repository of lead sheets that is

109
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,120
Melodies with lyrics and chord

110
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,560
symbols there were n about 1900 songs

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,759
189 9 5 in total that were in English

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,600
language that the encodings seem to be

113
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,080
high quality and that there were no

114
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,039
duplicates this is a repository called

115
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,600
wikip phonia that used to be freely

116
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,840
available on the internet and

117
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,280
unfortunately their license expired and

118
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,880
now uh is only available to those who

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,960
had downloaded it

120
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,680
beforehand in these 1900 songs there's

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,479
about 200,000 notes and a little bit

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,280
less than that in terms of the the words

123
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,240
and 70,000 chords so this is a big

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,199
repository to look

125
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:13,039
at we also used a second Corpus but this

126
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,599
one not a musical Corpus this is an open

127
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,400
crowdsource database of 14,000 common

128
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,759
English words that was made Mohammad

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,319
anney of the national research Council

130
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,919
of Canada and each of these words has

131
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,319
been coded according to the aects that

132
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:34,560
they have for instance words with the

133
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,960
affect of anticipation include skewed or

134
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,160
recreational or Zeal Holiness intimately

135
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,280
harbringer

136
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,520
birthday something I think we all

137
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,160
anticipate or plan and we can also look

138
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,680
at words that have that effect and that

139
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:54,440
effect alone so for instance if we look

140
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,520
at uh discust we see slim dong barf

141
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,360
diarrhea gratuitous

142
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,919
heartworm things that all only have this

143
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,160
particular affect together with a small

144
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,720
list of what we call stop words these

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,919
are words that have no affect and appear

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:17,599
too commonly such as the and

147
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:20,160
us she he about 60% of all the words in

148
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,560
the Psalms could be classified according

149
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,120
to affect or not having affect in the

150
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,160
stop list

151
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,360
mutal and there are at least

152
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,280
2,000 in instances of each affect and

153
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,840
some with over 12,000 that appeared in

154
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,919
the scorpus so there were in the

155
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,440
repository there were 2853 songs that

156
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,440
had anger in

157
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:52,080
them also in the in the Corpus were

158
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,520
25,000 words that were coded as being

159
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,960
mutual and then of those plus stop words

160
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,319
there were about 12,000 words that we

161
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:04,759
can be pretty sure to be neutral

162
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,319
and then 100 sorry 123,000 that could be

163
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,759
believed to be neutral and then

164
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:14,879
183,000 is all of the comprehensive uh

165
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:18,000
words that did not fill foot fit into

166
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,000
one of these 10

167
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,800
aects sun and I use Music 21 to

168
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,199
automatically label every instance of

169
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,520
the word in the data set alongside one

170
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,880
value that we are measuring at the time

171
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,640
so for instance this is the song Green

172
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,719
sleeves uh also known of at Christmas as

173
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,640
What Child Is This and in this excerpt

174
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,120
every word except for U the word alas

175
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,160
was identified by the composer by the

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,000
computer as being somewhere in the data

177
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:56,000
set but only two words in this excerpt

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,680
had a particular aect that had been

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,279
identified they a identified love as as

180
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:08,320
joy and positive and wrong as

181
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,839
negative so then we looked at

182
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,720
particular values that we could measure

183
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,040
for instance the one that I talked about

184
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,680
earlier about Pitch height so we're

185
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,640
going to look for each word look at the

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,839
first syllable How many semmit tones

187
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,920
above or below the previous note does

188
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,279
that word appear so my is two semitones

189
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,120
or a whole Step Above AAS uh love is two

190
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:38,399
semmit tones above

191
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,200
my going forward wrong is four semitones

192
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,800
below

193
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,839
me with measurements like this we can

194
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,800
test the first Theory do positive words

195
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,079
rise in pitch and negative words descend

196
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,079
in

197
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,079
Pitch here

198
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:02,399
is our graph of the results

199
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,839
for for this particular measurement what

200
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,040
we call the relative pitch measurement

201
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,600
and what we can do on the left are the

202
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,600
10 aects or emotions that we were

203
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,839
looking at anger anticipation discust

204
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,760
fear Joy negative positive sadness

205
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:23,279
surprise and trust and we can look at

206
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,040
words with that connotation compared to

207
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,160
the neutral words that had been

208
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,600
identified in the National research

209
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,959
Council Canada data set and we can see

210
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,560
that uh for instance looking across at

211
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,279
the Top Line um to the

212
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,680
highlighted to the highlighted figure

213
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,800
that anger was a little bit higher well

214
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,560
there's a plus sign so it was higher

215
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,160
than the neutal thing but the

216
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:54,240
0.89 is the P value that is our

217
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,560
confidence how often would such a value

218
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,959
happen by chance and um you subtract

219
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:05,680
from one so 1 minus .89 whatever it's

220
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,880
about 10% chance it would happened um by

221
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,800
chance that all the words for anger

222
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:15,040
would be higher and usually we don't

223
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:19,200
think of P values that are below 0.95 or

224
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:22,200
95% uh chance or 5% chance of happening

225
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,279
accidentally we don't think of those as

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,480
uh having meaning in fact when you do um

227
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,079
what we call a multiple comparison set

228
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,200
where we're looking at a lot of things

229
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:37,920
that once we really want P values that

230
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:42,000
are much better than 05 01 001 and so

231
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,279
on and so in this chart anger doesn't

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,360
have a particular color on the NRC

233
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:50,639
neutral set there's no no Stitch

234
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,959
significant value there nor does

235
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,920
anticipation disgust or

236
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,839
fear but joy on the other hand is

237
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,040
labeled with a uh sort of a darker blue

238
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,120
meaning that this is statistically

239
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,959
significant the three stars show how

240
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,800
statistically significant so words with

241
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:12,040
Joy are higher than neutral words

242
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,639
negative words didn't have any sort of P

243
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,600
value but positive words had a slight

244
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,880
positive uh correlation they're a little

245
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,480
bit higher but if we go down surprise

246
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,240
was a strong thing so words with

247
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,320
surprise were higher than other

248
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,120
words we can look at other parts and for

249
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,199
instance on the right um side this

250
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,680
triangular chart we can look at how each

251
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:40,480
affect correlates with another a effect

252
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,800
so we can see that surprise is slightly

253
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,360
statistically significantly higher than

254
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,279
words about anger or slightly

255
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,320
statistically significantly higher than

256
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,800
BS about

257
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,040
negative the column just to the right of

258
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,880
the yellow highlighted chart are the

259
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,880
stop words compared to the A and and

260
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,199
every single emotion or word is higher

261
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,920
in Pitch than a stop or you know just

262
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:11,680
think about when I say the it's pretty

263
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,519
low we don't tend to put this kind of

264
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,720
high emphasis on stops so I'm going to

265
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,279
show some of the things that that came

266
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,800
up comparing these affects to neutral

267
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:27,000
words because this seems to be the the

268
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,680
most fun and um interesting part of the

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,320
research so all of this this whole chart

270
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:38,199
will get reduced to a

271
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,519
single column in this chart and so we

272
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:44,199
can see the relative pitch that Joy

273
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,720
positive and surprise are

274
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:51,040
higher here is the key for the chart so

275
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,399
I don't show how much higher or how much

276
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,560
lower in pitch or how much more positive

277
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,639
or negative just the mag just the

278
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,320
direction in terms of the colors so blue

279
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:04,120
colors tend to be high in some way and M

280
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,040
and brown colors are lower and then the

281
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,360
intensity of the shade shows the P value

282
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,480
um so the first things that are shaded

283
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,480
happen only 1% chance um that they're

284
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,880
Happening by chance and then the next

285
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:24,880
shade is uh 1110th of 1% then going down

286
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,440
100th 1% 1,000th 1% one uh 10,000 1% and

287
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,880
you can see on the right as 10 to the -5

288
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,839
-6 7 you'll see some of the charts were

289
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,639
really showing things that are

290
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:42,440
absolutely positively not by chance

291
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,440
things with 10 to the -200 or or

292
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,040
more one of the things that we thought

293
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,800
was really interesting we looked at the

294
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,079
beat strength of every note so we

295
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,240
compared to the prevailing time

296
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,800
signature which is quite often 44 and

297
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
we're able to figure out what's on the

298
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,560
beat and what's off the beat and one of

299
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,680
the things we can see looking at the

300
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,000
blue parts that words conting joy and

301
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,639
positive emotions are really much more

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,480
common to happen on the beat similarly

303
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:15,399
with surprise and trust but looking at

304
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,360
things that happen off the beat or on

305
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:22,639
weak beats that's where you put the

306
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,279
words for anger or syncopate disgust or

307
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,480
fear or negative emotions tend to happen

308
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,240
on weaker

309
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,839
beats similarly we can look at the

310
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,800
length of notes that um almost nothing

311
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,040
has um a a positive correlation that

312
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,120
that say that is longer than you would

313
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,319
expect but these negative emotions anger

314
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,800
disgust fear and and just the general

315
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:52,040
negative tend to be on shter

316
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:57,440
notes so that we're we're really um just

317
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:00,199
sort of spitting out these short

318
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,360
emotions intriguing ly when we look at

319
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:06,120
the overall pitch the the pitch of a

320
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,360
note compared to the average pitch of

321
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,560
the entire song there's basically no

322
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,160
correlation we don't tend to

323
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:20,079
sing happy things high and set things

324
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,720
low only a little bit with positive

325
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,160
Happy Joy surprising things do we set

326
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,279
them a little bit higher than what was

327
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,279
happening

328
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,199
before did look at at

329
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,680
consonants What

330
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:38,600
notes with what words are set to notes

331
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,000
that are part of a consonant chord we

332
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,800
remember these are lead sheets so we

333
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,360
have the melody the words and also the

334
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,759
underlying chords we can see some of

335
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,000
these U negative emotions anger but

336
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,759
especially sadness and sub um are are on

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,160
more dissonant thing um notes than the

338
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,360
dissonant chords than the prevailing

339
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,440
peace but also

340
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,520
somewhat surprising Joy maybe that's a

341
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,400
way you emphasize joyful words or

342
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:11,760
surprising words you put them on

343
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:15,240
slightly um slightly more dissonant

344
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:19,240
words looked at two ways of classifying

345
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:24,240
the mode of a piece so major or minor

346
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:26,199
and um we looked at do certain emotions

347
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,280
appear more in songs that are in minor

348
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,679
versus in major and this is something

349
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,440
that I at least have always been taught

350
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,440
and I think many of us have been taught

351
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,600
that you know minor pieces are sad maybe

352
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,679
minor pieces are sad but their words

353
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,559
aren't any sadder than major mode pieces

354
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,840
There's no distinction between major and

355
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:51,080
minor uh when we look at the whole

356
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,120
piece so instead we used um and by the

357
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,799
way we will be looking later in the

358
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,280
semester and how we can computationally

359
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:01,600
measure the key of a piece U when we get

360
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:05,080
to Carol uh Carol Crum hansel's

361
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,360
work so we thought maybe you know maybe

362
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,240
it's not the whole piece but maybe that

363
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,240
these you know sad emotions appear in A

364
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,320
Minor section or piece using a lot of

365
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,720
minor chords within a larger piece so we

366
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,760
looked at the local mode just the mode

367
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,440
of the four measures on either side of

368
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,240
uh I think the support measures on

369
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,520
either side of a word and there we found

370
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,039
a very small correlation

371
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,440
but it was exactly the opposite we

372
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,880
expected in a local um section we use

373
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,640
Brown to represent minor in this case

374
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,799
and blue to represent major joy and

375
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,919
positive emotions tend to appear a

376
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,919
little bit more in locally minor

377
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,159
pieces what it might be is that there's

378
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:00,000
not this connotation of sadness or

379
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:02,960
negative or anger with minor but about

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,400
not knowing where you are so we looked

381
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,320
at the tonal certainty how how clear is

382
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,919
it what key we're in and here we found

383
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,000
some correlations that were negative

384
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,799
that is to say anger and negative words

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,720
tend to appear a little bit more in

386
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,039
tonally uncertain

387
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,280
passages now this isn't necessarily a

388
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,919
guide to composers for what to do but

389
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,159
what composers have done what people

390
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,159
have done in the

391
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,720
past so what did we learn by doing all

392
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,280
this words conting joy and surprise are

393
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,520
higher in Pitch than the surrounding

394
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,200
context but negative connotations such

395
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,919
as anger or disgust are not lower in

396
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,080
Pitch than a neutral

397
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,080
word positive words are not highlighted

398
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,480
with consequences if anything it's

399
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,240
slightly the

400
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,360
opposite in one measure of dissonance

401
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,520
however words conting sadness are more

402
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,559
common but negative words appear more

403
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,159
often in passages of tonal

404
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:13,320
uncertainty finally mode has almost no

405
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,520
correlation with the emotion of words

406
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,760
whether we're talking about the mode of

407
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,039
the pieace or whether the chord at that

408
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,120
moment is major or minor though surprise

409
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,400
and anticipation do get minor chords

410
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,400
more

411
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:33,360
often it may be that this connection of

412
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,400
minor with sad is one of these cases of

413
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:40,320
a purely musical connection that is to

414
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,640
say we've learned to hear minor music as

415
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,080
sad regardless of what the words are

416
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,760
about and this is something that as a

417
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,039
music historian I know hasn't been true

418
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,200
all throughout music's history uh there

419
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,720
were times when uh a pure major cordin

420
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,919
was considered harsh or a little bit sad

421
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,200
and that's not the case today but but

422
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,760
maybe when people do consistently report

423
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,760
in music psychology surveys that they

424
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,159
hear sadness in minor

425
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,480
pieces that there's something happening

426
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,320
that's not fully explained in the words

427
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,480
so there's always more research to

428
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,400
happen and I just want to thank you for

429
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:24,080
allowing me to share what Sophia son and

430
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,080
myself have found
