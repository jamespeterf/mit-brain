1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,519
I'm Mark Galer from Lincoln laboratory

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,160
uh and as I'll describe in a moment that

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,920
Lincoln laboratory is uh up in Lexington

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,720
of course we've had a long association

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,760
with campus as I'll describe um and

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,480
we're going to change gears here a

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,599
little bit uh and talk about next

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,160
Generation Computing uh but before I

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,080
begin uh want to thank Vladimir for

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
inviting us to to participate in the

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,160
Nano Summit where we're very honored to

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,559
do so uh of course we've collaborated

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,399
for decades uh with researchers on

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,800
campus uh but that has gotten more

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,079
engagement as Nano has been constructed

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,559
and we're looking forward to that uh so

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,600
I do have a couple of colleagues that

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,680
will dive into some details uh as we get

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,840
into the session uh so Ryan ke will come

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,440
up after I'm done and he'll talk about

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,760
our work on ferroelectric fets um so

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,320
Ryan has joined the laboratory about

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,960
four years ago he came to us from Intel

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,920
where he was working working on the 20a

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,720
uh process um he did his education at

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,479
Yukon and Penn State University and then

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,040
after that Alex WN we'll talk about our

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,479
work in superconducting electronics um

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,400
so Alex has been at the laboratory about

30
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,920
10 years and focused on superc conduct

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,520
electronics at whole time and he did his

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,439
education at Boston University in

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,360
vanderbelt so with that um I'll jump

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,479
into um Next Generation Computing and so

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,320
since this is the first time that

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,200
somebody's uh from lincol Laboratory has

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,960
talked at the summit I thought I'd begin

38
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,759
with just uh in my setup piece a little

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,960
overview of who we are at Lincoln where

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,280
we came from um and then how we

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,000
collaborate and connect with Nano uh

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,439
before we get into our more detailed

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,880
technical talk so the laboratory

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,240
actually has its origin in the radiation

45
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,840
laboratory that was on MIT campus during

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,840
World War II uh those you might not

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,920
realize that uh microwave Radars were

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,520
invented in World War II with the the

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,039
the British um about half I think 100 or

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,159
so Radars were developed uh at the rad

51
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,640
lab um they deployed about half of The

52
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,920
Radars that went into theater there um

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,640
at the end of the war they shut down the

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,840
radiation laboratory they wrote a series

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,519
of books that really defined the

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,879
foundation for microwave engineering um

57
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,400
and and that was it but then in the late

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,280
40s early 50s uh the Soviets had

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,040
developed a nuclear weapon and we were

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,760
concerned about them flying a longrange

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,400
bomber over the North Pole and so the

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,879
government came back to MIT and said hey

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,560
you did a great job for us in World War

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,920
II can you build a radar system for us

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,519
to protect the US and so we did um ended

66
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,920
up being the sage system it took about

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,840
seven years to develop um it was

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,640
operational from 1962 to 1983 uh

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,879
developed way or there was deployed well

70
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,800
over 100 radar installations with

71
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,879
communication networks Etc um so today

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,680
our mission has grown quite a bit in

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,840
where technology and support of National

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Security and we have a number of mission

75
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,319
areas uh that are shown on the bottom of

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,480
the screen there uh so as I mentioned

77
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,840
we're out in Lexington Mass on hansam

78
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,040
Air Force Base uh we have about 2

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,760
million square fet of lab and office

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,360
space um we're about 4,500 employees and

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,760
we did $1.4 billion worth of research

82
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,400
last year um in our key roles are really

83
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,959
system architecture engineering so this

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
is like designing constellations of

85
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,280
satellites and how they would get used

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
um long-term technology development

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,920
sometimes we engage for decades with

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,799
some of our sponsors uh to develop

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,799
technology um but we're really

90
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,959
passionate about is system prototyping

91
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,560
and demonstrations and this is a great

92
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,120
example of of that so we developed or

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,959
matured a 3D liar uh system so this

94
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,799
image was collected over Boston uh so

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,360
from an aircraft that flew at 13,000 ft

96
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,680
and collected in under two minutes um

97
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,120
and so what makes this image different

98
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,879
from a typical image is that the imager

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,280
that we use um behind every pixel it has

100
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,799
a timing circuit so we can send out a

101
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,439
pulse of of photons from a laser um and

102
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,680
knowing the position of the aircraft and

103
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,720
the direction that the imager was

104
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,000
pointed we can collect the data back

105
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,920
because we have the time of flight

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,920
information and we create this 3D Point

107
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,519
Cloud U that we can then Traverse

108
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,079
through this and so this was actually

109
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,079
deployed for uh the Department of

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
Defense in Afghanistan and South America

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,320
but it's also been used by FEMA for

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,720
disaster relief after earthquakes and

113
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,520
hurricanes and the like um so a lot of

114
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,160
the Prototype systems that we build

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,680
actually rely on microelectronics and so

116
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,639
through the years we've developed very

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
capable microelectronics fabrication

118
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,680
capability and we sort of intentionally

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
position ourselves in this no man's land

120
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,080
as I'm showing here so you can kind of

121
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,360
plot research flexibility uh versus

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,560
process maturity and of course the

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,639
factories that make seos are highly

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,080
capable yet they're very adverse to any

125
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,639
kind of change in their process um the

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,759
universities on the other end of the

127
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,360
scale their job is to create new devices

128
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,680
and so they Embrace materials diversity

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,000
and and and Fabrication flexibility

130
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,120
however they typically don't have the

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,199
scale to create circuits that are going

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,759
to go into prototype systems so we

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,840
choose to be in this middle land uh so

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,759
that we allow a lot of materials

135
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,120
flexibility yet we have Quality

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,360
Management Services or systems in place

137
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,600
so that we can yield larger circuits um

138
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,039
so our facility we operate at 245 uh

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,560
there's about 60 people that are

140
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,240
dedicated to this um and we have uh

141
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,360
proper certifications for that

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,680
um and so how we connect with Nano uh is

143
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,400
is shown here that uh you know of course

144
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,080
Nano isn't a normal university uh clean

145
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,240
room it's uh much beyond that and part

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,720
of what's happening is that we're

147
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,400
installing 200 mimer tools um but all

148
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,720
the same that Nano is probably going to

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,720
be a little more focused on device

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,840
Discovery and and you know materials

151
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,440
research um on that 200 mm platform and

152
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,520
we're working out the process where we

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,639
can transfer Wafers back and forth where

154
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,080
we can take advantage of some of the

155
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
capability that we have at Lincoln

156
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
Laboratory um to do more routine

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,400
processing U mature those devices so

158
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,039
that we can get them into uh these

159
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,000
prototype systems that that we really

160
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,680
enjoy

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,800
building um so we uh work on a variety

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,479
of materials so we're definitely a high

163
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,240
mix low volume Fab um but we will work

164
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,039
at all stages of materials maturity uh

165
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,840
from component Explorations with

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,160
emerging fet technology uh to component

167
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,080
capability uh both opto Electronics as

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,400
well as Electronics devices and some

169
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,919
some prototype systems uh so we have

170
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,800
full flow processes with pdks and all of

171
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,759
that and you can get to us through Nano

172
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,680
we're sort of tied at the hip uh from

173
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,280
that respect and and we welcome

174
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,039
collaborations going forward okay so

175
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,120
with that as a little bit of

176
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,720
introduction let me set up uh the talks

177
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,440
that you'll hear next and so one of the

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,879
things that we like to do as we work on

179
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,080
Research is really try to understand

180
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,160
where it fits into the big picture and

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,879
so we've created this hierarchical model

182
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,639
for computation and of course our

183
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,919
computation systems are extremely

184
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,680
complex machines uh even though they're

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,840
micro scale um and but if we look at

186
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,120
what goes into one of these

187
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,720
computational systems uh that we see

188
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,800
that sort of at the foundation we decide

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,479
how we're going to encode the

190
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,680
information into a state variable what

191
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,360
kind of device we're going to use the

192
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,080
materials Etc um and then as we go up

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,680
into the stack we have different levels

194
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,680
of optimization what kind of um circuit

195
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,639
architecture are we going to use

196
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,080
computer architecture Etc and in the

197
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,120
Golden Era of scaling the dinard scaling

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,840
um that and it's sort of the 2000 time

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,240
frame that you know life was great all

200
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,440
the focus was at the lower part of that

201
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,840
stack U making significant progress

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,800
every couple of years with faster

203
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,560
processors more more transistors Etc and

204
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,960
so there really wasn't a lot of need to

205
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,280
optimize the higher end of the stack um

206
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,560
what we've seen in the last couple of

207
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,599
decades is that as that dard scaling has

208
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,280
slowed down or stopped um that we have

209
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,159
optimized our computer architectures uh

210
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,240
in terms of started with gpus and then

211
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:09,759
tpus and now we have uh AI processing

212
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,840
units and the like um but even so with

213
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,919
those optim we're starting to run out of

214
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,759
steam that we're having to create

215
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,240
nuclear power plants to power our data

216
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,199
centers for that um so it's our belief

217
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,120
that we can you know maybe now is the

218
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,159
time to start looking at the lower end

219
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,000
of that stack a little bit more and see

220
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,039
is there new technology or different

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,440
technology uh that we can use um to to

222
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,320
relook at that and reduce the energy

223
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,279
consumption of these computational

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,519
systems and so what we'll see in Ryan's

225
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,760
talk is a different type of seos

226
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,200
transistor that's based on ferroelectric

227
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,120
layer um in the gate stack uh for for

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,440
benefit um and then with Alex's talk on

229
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,480
the superconducting electronics we're

230
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,399
actually going to go all the way to the

231
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,279
bottom um and look at a different state

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,760
variable in terms of how we encode the

233
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,440
information um into the circuit and then

234
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,480
the material system will be different um

235
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,480
so with that I'll turn it over to

236
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,240
[Applause]

237
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,120
Ryan all right well good afternoon

238
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
really appreciate this opportunity to be

239
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,200
with you all and want and want to thank

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,839
all the organizers for the invitation I

241
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,240
think it's been a great Summit so far

242
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,200
and happy to be part of this um Next

243
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,880
Generation compute session um so I'll be

244
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,240
sharing some of thech technology that

245
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,680
we're working on at Lincoln laboratory

246
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,079
to help develop computer chips that will

247
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,440
function more akin to how our brain

248
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:41,360
functions and before I get into that

249
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,920
neuromorphic Computing and the

250
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,360
ferroelectric transistors that we think

251
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,560
will enable that I want to put up this

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,720
slide is just kind of a broad landscape

253
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,240
overview of the computer chip

254
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,000
Technologies so this is this technology

255
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,640
has continuous innovation at its core

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,120
right this is the technology of Mo's law

257
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,200
better performance every year um to to

258
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,120
improve our lives in a myriad of ways

259
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,880
and those Innovations they cut across

260
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,560
all the system hierarchy of these chips

261
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,800
so starting at the very building block

262
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,839
of our integrated circuits at the

263
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,399
transistor level we see the adoption of

264
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,200
new materials and new device geometries

265
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,519
in order to further the number of

266
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,360
transistors that we can fit onto a given

267
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,640
siiz

268
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,480
chip we look at interconnects today

269
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,680
we're seeing the separation of the the

270
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,320
power routing from the signal lines in

271
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,480
order to improve efficiency of the way

272
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,880
these chip operate like Mark said we're

273
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,880
seeing the introduction of new chip

274
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,000
architectures Al together so the

275
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,839
graphics processing unit that we see has

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,279
been been very popularized from Nvidia

277
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,800
um taking over giving more computational

278
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,160
throughput compared to what we used to

279
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,680
rely on just the standard CPU years ago

280
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,440
we're also seeing innovation in

281
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,279
packaging so adoption of chiplets 3D

282
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,160
heterogeneously integrated materials to

283
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,200
Advance the functionality of the chips

284
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,680
chips that we put into

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,839
field and um all of these Innovations at

286
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,160
the Leading Edge these are all going to

287
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,399
be leveraged and used to enable the most

288
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,200
computationally intensive technology

289
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,440
applications that face us today so from

290
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,959
the machine learning algorithms and

291
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,880
large language models that go toward

292
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,440
personalized AI patterned and image

293
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,720
recognition that would be required to

294
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,880
support autonomous vehicles for example

295
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,160
the drug in material Discovery what

296
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,519
proteins should we be synthesizing all

297
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,360
the way to our Edge devices our

298
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,839
distributed sensors that need to

299
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
transmit data to the cloud for

300
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,920
computation to be done and then get some

301
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,519
signal back on on next instructions to

302
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,279
to comprise the internet of things and

303
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,079
of course the chips that we that we

304
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,920
design for all of these

305
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,760
applications we want them to work as the

306
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,079
highest performance possible and the way

307
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,279
that we get more performance from the

308
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,040
chips that we design for those

309
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,959
applications is typically Al bought with

310
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,920
power usage and I think that can be

311
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,760
appreciated by just looking at this two

312
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,279
AIS plot the y- AIS is computational

313
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,920
throughput that these various chips that

314
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,800
are populating the graph kind of are

315
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,040
capable of delivering and you see that

316
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,519
if you want more performance you

317
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,800
typically get that with more power and

318
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,839
it's a tricky tradeoff especially as we

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,040
consider that today somewhere between 5

320
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,680
to 15% of the global energy production

321
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,519
is used for computation and this is

322
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,079
forecasted to rise very deeply as we see

323
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,120
more data centers come online and the

324
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,040
internet of things grow faster

325
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,959
still so we need we need a new paradigm

326
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,440
here we need a better way of getting

327
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,160
more performance for a given power

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,440
because the alternative is as Mark

329
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,959
alluded to you see some companies saying

330
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,560
oh we'll just make our own nuclear

331
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,760
reactors to power our data center and

332
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,760
that might work for some of the

333
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,240
centralized Technologies but until we're

334
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,680
all ready to sign up to have our own

335
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,800
personal nuclear reactor um we need to

336
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,800
come up with something more creative on

337
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,959
the on the device side and so to do that

338
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,000
I think it's instructive to consider you

339
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,680
know this line that defines the

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,920
performance you get for a given power

341
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,560
usage and this line is defined by the

342
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,120
Von noyman bottleneck this Von noyman

343
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,920
bottleneck gets its name from the Von

344
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,079
noyman architecture this is the

345
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,800
architecture that leading chips today

346
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,639
still use so if you were to delid the

347
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,680
latest Intel chip that's coming out this

348
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,440
month you'll find that you know there

349
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,600
are multiple tiles here there's a Wi-Fi

350
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,120
tile we have a graphics processing tile

351
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,920
up top some IO here but the biggest tile

352
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,519
on the chip is the

353
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,360
CPU and what we have here is an8 core

354
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,800
CPU you see the big cores around the

355
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,399
periphery of the CPU and all around

356
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,720
those cores are these different levels

357
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:54,320
of cash memory and the cash memory is

358
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,360
there to give the the logic cell that's

359
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,160
doing the computation easier access to

360
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,160
the data that's stored and there's level

361
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,600
one cache that's relatively fairly

362
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,680
accessible but as these technological

363
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,920
needs require more and more data to to

364
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,199
perform their

365
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,160
functions the logic cell needs to reach

366
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,000
further and further away physically

367
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,839
because the logic and the memory are

368
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,160
physically distinct components into

369
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,720
maybe the third level of cach memory or

370
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,639
the main memory that might be off chip

371
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,600
entirely costing 100 or 1,00 times more

372
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,440
an energy penalty to go get that data to

373
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,279
do an operation on this also accounts

374
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,800
for about 80% of the time latency in the

375
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,600
way modern chips operate and so what can

376
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,399
we do about this well if the issue is

377
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,680
that we have distinct uh functionalities

378
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,320
of our chips located in distinct areas

379
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,680
well let's just put them closer together

380
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,120
let's um improve the memory capacity in

381
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,199
those cache cells and indeed this is

382
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,839
what's done on those gpus so this is why

383
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,759
I have the GPU and the supercomputer

384
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,000
slightly above my Von noyman bottleneck

385
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,480
line because they're already doing this

386
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,560
they're getting the memory cell closer

387
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,639
and closer to logic they're developing

388
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,839
ways to make those level one caches

389
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,880
larger but there's that we can do better

390
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,880
yet if we take a queue from nature and

391
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,519
think about how our brains operate well

392
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,160
our brains actually do computation in

393
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:22,160
memory and so if we could not just put

394
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,959
the the computation um near the the

395
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,399
memory but actually enable the memory

396
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,560
cell to do computation itself well now

397
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,839
we're talking about a way to access um

398
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,720
highly High throughput highly efficient

399
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,399
chip architectures and if you want to

400
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,240
design this type of

401
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,399
in-memory uh logic cell there are a few

402
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,279
main things you're going to be looking

403
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,839
for one is low read and write energies

404
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,440
second would be fast read and write

405
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,440
times and the third is nonvolatility in

406
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,959
the architecture we don't want to have

407
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,440
to always apply power to this circuit in

408
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,720
order for it to keep its memory so we

409
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,480
really want the nonvolatility as well

410
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,959
and as you consider the spider chart

411
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,959
against um these very these variables

412
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,480
that would be attractive for embedded

413
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,160
non-volatile memory architecture this

414
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,440
ferroelectric Field Effect transistor

415
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,120
scores quite well across the board and

416
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,560
so what I'd like to do is you know we

417
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,759
understand the Leading Edge today but

418
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,319
what's coming tomorrow I think a very

419
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,240
attractive device is the next Generation

420
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:27,519
transistor of a ferroelectric transistor

421
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,000
and how this could enable Beyond Von

422
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,759
noyman architectures in memory

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,279
computation and potentially neuromorphic

424
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,880
compute chips so I'd really like to

425
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:39,120
introduce this F electric chip for

426
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,120
anyone who hasn't um heard of it yet uh

427
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,680
a ferroelectric material let me start

428
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,319
there is a material that exhibits a

429
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,680
spontaneous and reorient internal

430
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:51,120
polarization so a standard dialectric or

431
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,959
a standard insulator the center of

432
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,639
positive and negative charge on a

433
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,079
atomistic unit cell level are collocated

434
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,440
so there's no dipole that exists in a

435
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,880
insulator but a ferroelectric the center

436
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,640
the spatial Center of positive and

437
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,000
negative charge are physically separate

438
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,400
um and so there exist this spontaneous

439
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,880
dipole in the unit cell and the

440
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,439
interesting thing about fer electrics is

441
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,880
not only does a dipole exist but you can

442
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,240
indeed apply an external electric field

443
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,640
and switch the orientation and then that

444
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,439
unit cell will stay in that polarization

445
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,039
orientation until acted upon and you can

446
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,839
cycle these many many millions or

447
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,799
trillions of times they're very stable

448
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,600
materials they've been known for over a

449
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,520
hundred years however they've all it's

450
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,080
been only observed in material systems

451
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,720
that are not seos compatible or not very

452
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,200
seos compatible either in their

453
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,320
composition or their scalability that

454
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,799
was the case until around 2011 where

455
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,520
stable Fair electricity was identified

456
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,760
in doped hnea material systems so while

457
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,480
hafnia is a normal dialectric if you add

458
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,679
some dopen elements you can actually

459
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,000
stabilize Fair

460
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,200
electricity and so what I'm showing here

461
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,559
is haia being doped with zirconia where

462
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,600
both end members hafnia and zirconia are

463
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,000
normal dielectrics we see multiple

464
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,880
stable ferroelectric phases in the

465
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,320
intermediary and this is very enticing

466
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,360
now as you start to think about ways to

467
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,559
um include this spontaneous polarization

468
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:22,240
into computer chips because well by the

469
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,559
time this was discovered in 2011 hafnia

470
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,080
was already the gate oxide for

471
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,960
state-of-the-art devices and so you're

472
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,280
already halfway there if we could just

473
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,080
add some zirconia into that

474
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,400
compositional mix we could start playing

475
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,799
with this new mechanism at the heart of

476
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,799
the transistor right next to the channel

477
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,440
operation and indeed these different

478
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,960
phases of ferroelectricity are useful

479
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm going to talk mostly about the

480
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,240
in-memory compute um capability with the

481
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,720
ferroelectric phase but if you start

482
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,520
pairing these together you can build

483
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,120
some very interesting gate Stacks where

484
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,480
I won't have the time today to get into

485
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,600
the details but I encourage you to look

486
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,159
at this paper that we worked on with

487
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,120
Professor Chima who's now MIT faculty

488
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:05,360
where we were able to take our 90 nanm

489
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,679
seos node it's a pretty mature node but

490
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,080
by integrating these halfa zerconia

491
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,720
super latus gate Stacks we were able to

492
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,559
demonstrate a two node advancement in

493
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,799
the transistor performance competing

494
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,039
with a 40 or even a 30 nmet transistor

495
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,000
node so yeah please do check out the

496
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,480
paper but I'm going to continue on now

497
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,840
with our in-memory compute theme um

498
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,360
thinking about how a ferroelectric

499
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,400
transistor could be built with this

500
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,080
material

501
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,559
first take a step back I'm sure a lot of

502
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,280
us are familiar with the transistor but

503
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,360
for those who aren't we're talking about

504
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,840
a device that it's a three- terminal

505
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:45,480
device so if we apply a bias from uh

506
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,640
whoops back if we apply a bias from

507
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,280
source to

508
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,320
drain um we would be providing a driving

509
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,799
force for current to flow through the

510
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,679
Silicon Channel but because silicon is a

511
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,520
semiconductor and kind of ground state

512
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,159
it's not a very good conductor of those

513
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,320
electrons that want to flow

514
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,960
so we would register a very low current

515
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,080
think nanoamps but by by applying a very

516
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,960
small signal to the gate terminal that's

517
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
what I'm plotting on this xaxis you'll

518
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,480
see many ordered magnitude increase in

519
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,720
the amount of current that's reaching

520
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,760
the drain um as the channel is inverted

521
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,480
and the Silicon becomes strongly

522
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,440
conducting so this is the general basis

523
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,840
of a transistor we can use these two

524
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,880
distinct states to store data perform

525
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,919
logic

526
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,640
operations and a like so what happen if

527
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,520
we put a ferroelectric right there at

528
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,039
the heart of the device as the gate

529
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,360
oxide well when a ferroelectric material

530
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:41,120
is uh initially grown it will typically

531
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,919
organize itself into domains that you'd

532
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,840
have offsetting polarization directions

533
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,640
so if you look closely here I have some

534
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,200
domains where the polarization is

535
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,000
pointed up and some where they're down

536
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,679
and they kind of go back and forth to

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,400
kind of find a nice equilibrium without

538
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,240
too much charge free energy to pay for

539
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,559
but like I said if you apply a voltage

540
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,640
across a

541
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,280
capacitor like the gate oxide for

542
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,360
example you can align all of these

543
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,840
dipoles such that all of the positive

544
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,720
charges would be facing maybe the bottom

545
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,360
of this capacitor as the gate oxide that

546
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,000
means you're putting positive charges

547
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,360
right near the channel interface that

548
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,679
attracts negative charges up in from the

549
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,440
silicon and effectively what this does

550
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,760
is it reduces the voltage required to be

551
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,760
applied to the gate in order to turn the

552
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,440
device on you can remove this voltage

553
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,360
and it will stay in this state and

554
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,520
function as a normal transistor with

555
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,240
this lower threshold

556
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,919
voltage alternatively you can switch the

557
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,520
polarity of the applied voltage reorient

558
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,080
all of the domains end up with a

559
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,400
positive charge at the bottom attracting

560
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,320
um attracting that kind of holes into

561
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,799
the channel and you'll see the turn on

562
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,320
voltage shift to a higher value and so

563
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,279
what we have is this reprogrammable

564
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,080
switch where we can put the device in a

565
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,760
low VT or a high VT State and Define

566
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,400
this memory window such that based on

567
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,679
however it's programmed we can later go

568
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,000
back and ping this gate with a given

569
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,559
read voltage and see if the bit is read

570
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,480
at low current or if it's at high

571
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:16,640
current and this is how this transistor

572
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,919
nonvolatile memory

573
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,440
works and and and because of this

574
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,799
functionality you know it's again very

575
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,080
attractive for inmemory

576
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,039
computation this is some data from

577
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,840
Global foundaries they have arguably the

578
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,440
most mature ferroelectric fet technology

579
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,799
this is not just a concept even though

580
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,640
I've only really shown schematics so far

581
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,240
um these devices are being built they're

582
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,320
being built at scale Global foundaries

583
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,840
has pretty high yield and repeatability

584
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,679
on these devices they're using a gate

585
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,080
first integration scheme and instead of

586
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,640
doping the haia with zirconia they're

587
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,720
doping with silicon nonetheless they

588
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,440
have a nice impressive memory window and

589
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,440
um through this gate first integration

590
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,520
scheme have shown some promising

591
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,600
circuits in University collaborations

592
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,080
using this device they've also been

593
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,559
ahead of the pack and identifying what

594
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,279
are the real challenges to really put

595
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,840
this device into high volume

596
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,799
manufacturing they're working on charge

597
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,720
trapping and endurance problems that

598
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,679
they've already been able to

599
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,919
identify we're also working on this

600
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,760
device at Lincoln Labratory and we're

601
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720
taking a slightly different approach

602
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,600
we're using a replacement gate scheme so

603
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,360
this means we fabricate the device

604
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,279
nearly till it's about done you really

605
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,520
could call it done and make contact to

606
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:33,480
the device and use it as a transistor

607
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,679
but rather than calling it done we go

608
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,679
back and we open up and remove the gate

609
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,200
that was present the polysilicon that

610
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,440
was there that was serving as the dummy

611
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,039
gate terminal and the silicon dioxide

612
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,159
gate oxide that was there we clean it

613
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,480
all out and now we have an opportunity

614
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,320
to redeposit a special gate oxide a half

615
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,679
Neo zerconia gate oxide or any other

616
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,200
ferroelectric material that's of

617
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,480
interest and once we do this we can move

618
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,600
it right to the end of line make

619
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,320
contacts there's no more High thermal

620
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,840
process steps that might um disrupt the

621
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,200
functionality of those special layers

622
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,200
that were

623
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,080
deposited so with this technology we're

624
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,120
working on developing a full process

625
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,760
design kit that has all of the

626
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,080
parameters and design rules that would

627
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,320
be needed for a circuit designer to come

628
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,679
up with the ideas of how to actually use

629
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,919
this new device we haven't before had a

630
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,679
transistor that could have its threshold

631
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,159
voltage changed like this in a

632
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,760
non-volatile way how do you even use

633
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,960
that we're hoping to be able to set up a

634
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,840
mechanism where we can work toward um

635
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,440
finding the best Gat stack possible for

636
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,760
this type of

637
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,279
technology and kind of some early looks

638
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,240
at what can you even do with this um it

639
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,600
have already been published in

640
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,799
literature so Professor K who's a who's

641
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,080
a collaborator of ours is showing here

642
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,960
um on on on your left some very

643
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,720
efficient highly parallelized memory

644
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,960
cells where you could do this highly

645
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,360
paralyzed memory um using a standard SRM

646
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,440
circuit but it has a very large

647
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,240
footprint and it requires a whole lot of

648
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,240
power but nonetheless this is the

649
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,120
architecture that's used on server chips

650
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,760
and alike but by moving to a

651
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,320
ferroelectric Fed architecture you'll

652
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,279
see about a six order magnitude

653
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,240
Improvement in the energy and time

654
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,720
latency with a smaller footprint due to

655
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,200
the non-volatile nature of the

656
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,120
device another example here Professor

657
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,559
Bowen at Stanford is showing thinking

658
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,559
about neuromorphic Computing and

659
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,480
recognizing the spatial temporal

660
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,279
electrical patterns that our brain uses

661
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,000
in order to encode complex

662
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:42,320
information and um well there's a little

663
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,159
bit of Animation there but um you know

664
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,360
could we use the same type of spatial

665
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,200
temporal

666
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,279
signature and apply it across a varied

667
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,000
uh gate electrode and because we can we

668
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,080
have control over how much of the

669
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,039
polarization rotates with an applied

670
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,080
electric field with the fer

671
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,880
we can encode a very specific

672
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,840
um uh very specific conductance through

673
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
the channel based on the localized

674
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,120
dipoles that are in the ferroelectric so

675
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,640
we have this like secondary axis to

676
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,480
start encoding information and um

677
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,720
mimicking neural

678
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,200
networks so just to summarize you know

679
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,840
we think about these very

680
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,760
computationally intensive applications

681
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,960
and want to continue to find ways to

682
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,880
enable high performance at lower power

683
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,679
improve efficiency and we think that the

684
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,320
in-memory computation with ferroelectric

685
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,279
fets is is a great candidate we're

686
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,360
working on this in the microelectronics

687
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,480
laboratory just up the street MIT

688
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,880
Lincoln Laboratory um to support further

689
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,440
labto faab

690
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,000
transitions you know talked about the

691
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,000
Leading Edge and how ferroelectric

692
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,200
transistors could play into neuromorphic

693
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,360
architectures in the future but the

694
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,279
exciting thing is that there are a whole

695
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,360
host of um potential solutions to

696
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:01,480
advance the technology of computer chips

697
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,039
and um my my colleague Alex is going to

698
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,320
come up here shortly and and speak about

699
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,480
superconducting

700
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,159
Electronics as one of them um with that

701
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,600
I'll just thank you for your attention

702
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,320
and leave this here for a second just

703
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,799
thanking the collaborators from MIT UC

704
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,600
Berkeley Notre Dame and the whole entire

705
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,990
microelectronics team so thank you very

706
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,299
much

707
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:24,299
[Applause]

708
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,720
uh I'm Alex W I also work at Lincoln

709
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,919
laboratory I work on an even more exotic

710
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,120
technology than ferel electric uh

711
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,679
transistors although it's actually been

712
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,159
around a little bit longer and so in

713
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,200
some ways it's more mature and we're

714
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,240
building bigger circuits out of it um so

715
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,600
I'd like to tell you a little bit about

716
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,600
that so uh a little bit of the

717
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,279
background why bother with such an

718
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,960
exotic technology we're going to replace

719
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,760
semiconductors with

720
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,600
superconductors uh people have thought

721
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,559
this might be a good idea for for quite

722
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,200
a while you have as a quick refresher

723
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:06,799
semiconductors are terrible at

724
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,840
conducting electricity you can make them

725
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,399
a little bit better or a little bit

726
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,039
worse normal metals are pretty good

727
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,640
conductors but they still burn a bunch

728
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,640
of power and you have dual heating

729
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,519
superc conductors at DC don't burn any

730
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,720
power so you could set a little

731
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,039
circulating current in the super

732
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,559
conductor and it will sit there until

733
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,760
the end of the universe um so that that

734
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,919
might be a low power way to build

735
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,279
Electronics but how are you going to

736
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,640
practically do

737
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,159
that so there's a bunch of potential

738
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,799
applications I'm going to focus on

739
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,559
digital electronics which is sort of the

740
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:38,360
same theme uh as my colleague there's

741
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,159
also applications for things like RF

742
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Electronics particle detectors and

743
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,640
Quantum information science um super

744
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,720
conducting cubits are sort of the

745
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,440
leading Quantum uh modality particle

746
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,080
detectors can be made all sorts of ways

747
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,399
superc conductors uh have uh this this

748
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,519
quick turn on that depends on

749
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,559
temperature so when a a particle hits it

750
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,519
you can get good energy resolution by

751
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,960
seeing how good of a superconductor it

752
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,720
is right at the transition temperature

753
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,000
and uh similarly in the RF domain

754
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,159
there's very low losses at high

755
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,600
frequencies okay so you know a little

756
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,240
bit about this uh energy of computation

757
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,880
is becoming enormous people are building

758
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,159
uh multiple nuclear power plants to deal

759
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,240
with it mois law is over dinard scaling

760
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,600
is over and so we might try to do

761
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,279
something different um so I'm going to

762
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,880
propose we jump to something as

763
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,679
different as possible let's just pick

764
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,640
the device that has the lowest

765
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,840
fundamental switching energy that we can

766
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,039
come up with uh so it turns out there's

767
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,600
this adiabatic limit uh known as the

768
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,840
land hour limit that says if you change

769
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,399
the amount of entropy in the universe by

770
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,399
sending two bits into a gate and

771
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:48,960
deleting one of them only one comes out

772
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:50,360
that costs KBT ln2 energy basically so T

773
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,640
is the temperature you're up you're at

774
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:57,559
KBT is uh related to the thermodynamic

775
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,399
system and okay these funny superc

776
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,799
conducting objects here we can build

777
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:03,039
parametric amplifiers that are

778
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,640
superconducting all the time and we just

779
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,080
use a nonlinear inductance in the

780
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,440
superconductor instead of even using

781
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,159
resistance we never even switch it

782
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,039
normal and we can get you know down to

783
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,600
KBT if we want to and we can build

784
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,080
things like adders that actually do

785
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,240
relevant

786
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,760
math um the second reason you might want

787
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,720
to go to superconductor Electronics

788
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,399
which is historically why it was

789
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,880
investigated for a long time although it

790
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,960
turns out there's it's it's a little bit

791
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,760
harder to find applications that benefit

792
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,159
purely from speed um

793
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,799
is that you can set you can set records

794
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,279
in the fastest switching technology so

795
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,279
if you want a digital frequency divider

796
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,880
you can make one it runs at close to a

797
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,080
terahertz if you want to make things

798
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,240
like G bet adders you can you can build

799
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,679
those that run at 100 gahz plus in

800
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,120
practice most of the world is limited

801
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,679
not by

802
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,000
single-threaded uh speed it's limited by

803
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,240
power and so I'm going to focus on

804
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,039
power all right so there's a lot of

805
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,039
recent progress over the last 10 years

806
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,679
or so that means that it's now possible

807
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,320
to build relatively large circuits um

808
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,799
whereas 10 years ago it was not and

809
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,399
that's why I'm here

810
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:09,320
now so if you look at say a 909m seos

811
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,919
Fab both of these Fabs exist within

812
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,880
Lincoln laboratory Lincoln has the

813
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,639
state-of-the-art in superc conducting uh

814
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,080
fabrication where we're building these

815
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:20,799
circuits you can compare to 90 nmet seos

816
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,240
Fab it's a similar stack uh similar line

817
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,279
width similar Edge tools similar depth

818
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,559
tools the main difference is that you

819
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,279
know number one we replace our metal

820
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,039
wiring layers with niobium which is a

821
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:34,240
super conductor transition temperature

822
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,000
is 9 Kelvin we operate typically at 4

823
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,399
Kelvin about the boiling point of liquid

824
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,600
helium uh and we replace our transistors

825
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,440
with something else called a Jose's

826
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,840
injunction which is essentially a weak

827
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,240
link that you can either switch just

828
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,000
long enough to uh emit one magnetic flux

829
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,480
Quant to to change out of the superc

830
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,399
conducting State just for a short time

831
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,960
um or my preference is to not switch it

832
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,279
at all and just use it as a nonlinear

833
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,559
inductor that depends on the amount of

834
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,159
current flowing G it uh so the the moral

835
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,240
of the story is that we get to repurpose

836
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,320
these older 90 NM seos Fabs and uh

837
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,240
dinard scaling would never existed for

838
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,840
superc conductors it's been long dead so

839
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,200
regardless of the size of the device the

840
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,000
power dissipated is the same so we don't

841
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,240
have to push to three nanometers or half

842
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,880
a nanometer uh to get attracted power

843
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,120
numbers which is another

844
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,159
benefit so

845
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,480
historically Dudley Buck invented the

846
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,840
catron at MIT in the 50s uh which is

847
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,399
basically an super conducting equivalent

848
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,559
of a transistor you wrap a wire around

849
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,960
the super conductor put enough current

850
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:37,799
through it and it kills it so you switch

851
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,480
between super and normal um for a long

852
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,919
time there was work on switching

853
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,960
superconductors between the normal State

854
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,600
and the super conducting domain you

855
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,360
still burn power when you're just a

856
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,519
normal metal and so there's you know

857
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,679
it's inherently never going to be quite

858
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,240
as efficient as being purely in the

859
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,639
superc conducting domain and you know

860
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,600
over the past number of years people

861
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:58,240
have moved to things like uh you know

862
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Cupid Focus processes uh for simulated

863
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,000
in meing like d-wave um and we've moved

864
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,399
to never switching things out of the

865
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,080
superc conducting domain as well even

866
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,080
for classical Electronics to get the

867
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,720
lowest possible

868
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,159
power we've also pushed in scale so this

869
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,799
is to give you an idea that we can

870
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,919
actually build relatively large circuits

871
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,000
so this is a a shift register memory

872
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,480
people use these to kind of just

873
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Benchmark processes and show that

874
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,399
there's no dead bits Etc um this W you

875
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,840
know held the record for quite a while

876
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,840
although I think DW's recent processor

877
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,919
is a little bit bigger at this point

878
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,720
it's near a million Junctions uh it's a

879
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,679
1 centimeter by 1 centimeter chip uh if

880
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,919
you can see the in the blowup picture

881
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,880
there's uh a couple of bit cells there

882
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,679
each one is Four J

883
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,399
injunctions and you know it's a 200

884
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:47,320
kilobit memory cell so we can we can

885
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,039
build things of of large and relevant

886
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,000
complexity and we've been scaling since

887
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:54,240
then so that was a few years ago and we

888
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,679
continue to scale on a quasi mors law

889
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,919
path although we don't get the benefit

890
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,240
of reduced energy you still want to get

891
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
to a scale that's large enough that you

892
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,960
can fit important things like multi-bit

893
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,360
parallel multipliers and adders Max we

894
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,360
want to build a processor that can do

895
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,520
something useful uh it has to be big

896
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,359
enough to have enough throughput to do

897
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,919
something useful and so over the past

898
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:15,040
several years we've scaled to you know

899
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:17,399
megabits per ceter densities which

900
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,599
starts to look relevant uh to folks who

901
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,960
design in

902
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,800
cosos and you can plot Wikipedia has a

903
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,480
JJ count page that compares us to the

904
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,960
mors law scaling transistor count page

905
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,800
we started a little bit behind we're

906
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,679
still a little bit behind uh but we're

907
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,200
trying to jump up the curve as fast as

908
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,200
we

909
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,879
can okay so now now that you know this

910
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,960
thing exists we can build megabit you

911
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,919
know per centimeter squared uh type

912
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,800
circuits we can build big parallel

913
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,079
multipliers Etc uh if you're somebody

914
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,200
who wants to design of this process how

915
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,119
do you do that in

916
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,440
practice so I'm going to Advocate that

917
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,960
you use this funny object here known as

918
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,320
a Quantum flux perimetron

919
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,960
uh it looks pretty similar to uh Cubit

920
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,720
design there's a couple of Jose's

921
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,160
injunctions so those little X's are

922
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,079
essentially nonlinear

923
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,599
inductors and it operates if you've ever

924
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:14,760
seen these old famous papers on

925
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,760
adiabatic computation and the there's

926
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,760
this beautiful adiabetic model that says

927
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,960
here's the lowest energy way to possibly

928
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,400
do math uh you take an energy level and

929
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,280
you don't uh just drop from one energy

930
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,119
State down to another one instead you

931
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,000
slowly move your system to a state where

932
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,920
two energy levels exist to one where

933
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,680
only one energy level exists and back

934
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,200
again and that's literally what we do so

935
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,400
we have this nonlinear inductance which

936
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,079
changes the energy state of the system

937
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,200
and effectively all you have to know uh

938
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,520
in designing this is that if you put in

939
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,119
positive current flowing from top to

940
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,560
bottom you can call that current level

941
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,160
one when your clock comes if it's a

942
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,560
small positive current it'll amplitude

943
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,520
it up to data level one so one micro

944
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,560
micr might come in 50 microamps will

945
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,880
come out if it's a small negative

946
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,000
current minus one microamp minus two

947
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,400
minus5 it's going to get Amplified to

948
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,079
minus 50 microamps out and it does that

949
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,680
because of this either change in the

950
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,240
energy landscape you can think of it as

951
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,960
or this kind of saturating nonlinear

952
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,160
inductance of the just

953
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,640
injunctions um and if you want to start

954
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,880
building math out of this you can build

955
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,079
majority Gates uh which just says if you

956
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,319
wire a few currents together maybe it's

957
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,560
plus one plus one and minus one two

958
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:29,359
cancel out plus one wins out gets in

959
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,920
simplified back to the data level and

960
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,240
this majority gate is a three three

961
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:38,160
input gate um and that plus inverter

962
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,319
gets you uh gets you any logical

963
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,240
function you

964
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:43,720
want so here's a couple of these uh bit

965
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,760
cells and some of our recent work on

966
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,760
this library and so we've designed these

967
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,720
Gates you can see uh at your left the

968
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,880
layout which is a you know zoomed in GDs

969
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,599
file which is the same same technology

970
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,280
used to fabricate C circuits you can see

971
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:03,400
the schematic

972
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,839
um and at my right your left you can see

973
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,400
uh memories that are built out of this

974
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:10,680
Quantum Flex parron based circuit done

975
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,400
with collaborators here uh at CBA on MIT

976
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,160
campus and we stored a bunch of data uh

977
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,800
and the impressive thing about these is

978
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,040
that they may not be as large as the

979
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,040
earlier

980
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,920
memories but the bit level energy is

981
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,839
about 10 - 21 jewles you know per bit

982
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,280
which is so this is s 24 KBT level

983
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,119
energies to store this

984
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,119
information and we started building

985
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,599
bigger things so that was a a little

986
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,200
three bit uh energy cell or three bit

987
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,480
memory cell uh and we've recently built

988
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,560
up to larger register files which looks

989
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,319
like the level one caches that you might

990
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,760
see in the stack of a of a computer core

991
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:54,079
as well as things like parallel

992
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,119
multipliers adders Etc built out of the

993
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,720
same cells uh and we have a pdk we have

994
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,040
a cell Library we have a lot of things

995
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,319
that we can share to make this easier

996
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,800
for uh digital designers and analog

997
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:06,280
designers in the real world to use them

998
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,040
as if they're sea

999
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,800
settlements so this is uh not from us

1000
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,040
but from some of our friends one of whom

1001
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,520
uh is just down the street at Atlantic

1002
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,480
Quantum now who's historically at

1003
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,040
Yokohama National University uh showing

1004
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,240
that yes in fact you can build full

1005
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,800
processors out of this that have uh

1006
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,440
useful instruction sets and still

1007
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,440
operate with this few KBT level energy

1008
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,960
all

1009
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,119
right so the the P section is what I

1010
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,920
would argue is the most relevant

1011
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,000
application building low energy

1012
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,640
processors scaling these up tackling

1013
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
this large scale energy problem using a

1014
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,680
totally different technology um if you

1015
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,040
wanted to do something different so

1016
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,599
occasionally for things like DSP for

1017
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,720
example you want to know uh you just

1018
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,760
want the answer as fast as you can

1019
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,200
possibly get it so you might want to

1020
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,240
figure out how do I design a circuit

1021
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,319
that operates digitally at 100 GHz uh in

1022
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,240
that case what you can do is you can

1023
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:01,760
actually switch the superconductor

1024
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,800
there's a limit to how short of a time

1025
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,400
you can switch it it has to be at least

1026
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,839
one magnetic flux Quantum because

1027
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,480
magnetic flux is quantized in superc

1028
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,119
conductors and so you can put a little

1029
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,520
shunt resistor that lets it switch just

1030
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,839
for that long and then it ret trps um

1031
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,160
and then you can take the little pulse

1032
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:18,319
you've

1033
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,839
generated looks like a current voltage

1034
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:25,359
pulse it's about uh 2 molts times a PC

1035
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,680
maybe 2 molts high PC wide and now you

1036
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:32,760
can start do doing processing at NE

1037
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,920
Herz um in order to do this because we

1038
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,760
only have a two- terminal device uh what

1039
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,720
you do is you store some information in

1040
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,280
a local Loop and then you basically

1041
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,200
sample and check with a clock whether or

1042
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,880
not there's a one or a zero stored in

1043
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,480
that

1044
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,160
Loop and we can work all you know I can

1045
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,560
give the examples for end Gates or Gates

1046
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,200
Etc if you care later uh but the moral

1047
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,720
of the story this is again this lets you

1048
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,920
build everything you want and it

1049
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,839
operates at a few hundred

1050
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:01,200
gahz so here's an example

1051
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,560
uh 8 bit serial letter uh one reason I

1052
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,400
say in specific this is relevant to

1053
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,040
things like DSP and less relevant to

1054
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,160
things like CPUs is because if you want

1055
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,359
to operate at about 100 gigahertz you

1056
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,880
start to run into this problem that uh

1057
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,920
if you have your memory over here and

1058
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,640
you have your CPU over here the speed of

1059
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,520
light unfortunately is only so fast and

1060
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,960
it's it's not getting any faster and so

1061
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,079
uh unless you know you think of a a

1062
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:31,079
smart way to collocate these objects um

1063
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,319
you know it takes SE some number of nanc

1064
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,839
just to get back and forth between the

1065
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,400
CPU and memory and so it's it's

1066
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,920
essentially impossible in the typical

1067
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,079
Von noyman sense to operate a CPU at

1068
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,000
these speeds uh people try to do things

1069
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,480
like pipelining um but that only works

1070
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,119
even in theory to you know some number

1071
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,000
of logical pipeline stages and it gets

1072
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,920
slower and slower so there's but you can

1073
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,800
still build things like adders

1074
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,520
multipliers uh lots of DSP

1075
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:00,079
related problems including things like

1076
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,920
Matrix math that people care quite a bit

1077
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,079
about all right what

1078
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,240
next so my hope with this is to

1079
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,839
introduce all you folks who might be

1080
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,800
smart electrical engineers computer

1081
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:17,400
scientists Etc to this uh unusual

1082
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,359
technology it's relatively mature in the

1083
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,520
fabrication space but there is an

1084
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,119
enormous amount of innovation in the

1085
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,680
computer architecture space how to

1086
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,680
encode information how to process

1087
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,760
information what to do with extremely

1088
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,240
low energy computer

1089
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:37,119
processors um and there's you know

1090
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,680
significant active work um in the design

1091
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:43,599
of all of these elements and it's

1092
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:46,480
scaling quickly so over the past uh five

1093
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:50,720
seven years or so we've brought up this

1094
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:54,520
process uh we call it sfq 5e single flux

1095
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,240
Quantum uh e for energy efficient and

1096
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,599
we've had collaborators at many many

1097
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,920
places uh over 300

1098
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:06,599
Publications uh co-authored using this

1099
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,480
process uh and I hope that perhaps uh we

1100
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:10,640
could encourage some of you to to submit

1101
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,560
as well and help solve this some of the

1102
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,560
interesting problems in this

1103
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,440
field okay thank you Alex so why don't

1104
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,440
we take a few questions

1105
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,079
okay so before we get to some of the

1106
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,960
questions from the audience um why don't

1107
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,400
I start with sort of a question from

1108
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,680
each of you uh or for each of you on

1109
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,200
what do you see as the top one or two

1110
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,000
things that are really holding back to

1111
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,640
mature the technology that you're

1112
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,480
working on start with Brian and where's

1113
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,160
it going what is the goal that you see

1114
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,640
next and what are the the top one or two

1115
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,680
things to prevent you from getting yeah

1116
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,319
it's it's

1117
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,960
there are a number of so for ferel

1118
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:04,800
electric fets um there are a number of

1119
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,319
of challenges and things that we'll need

1120
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,800
to continue to do in the development so

1121
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,559
this is a new uh device that's kind of

1122
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,839
been prototyped there's still a lot of

1123
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:16,839
issues to work out in terms of endurance

1124
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:18,119
reproducibility and avoiding like kind

1125
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,800
of killer defects that have all been

1126
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,839
sorted out on Advanced Coss nodes but

1127
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,480
now introducing this new material you

1128
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:25,720
have to kind of go back and understand

1129
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,480
you know what are causing some of these

1130
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,079
new defect modes and and circuit

1131
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,920
failures and how do we engineer around

1132
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,960
those I think there's still questions

1133
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,559
you know what is the actual correct and

1134
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,480
best gate stack to use um um but I I

1135
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:44,000
think there's a path forward on on most

1136
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,119
of these questions for f electric fets

1137
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,480
okay so some question you ask yeah I

1138
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,559
think for superc conductor Electronics I

1139
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,599
I so there's a lot of work still in the

1140
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,040
computer architecture space and then you

1141
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,400
know what's the smartest way to encode

1142
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,280
information what's the smartest way to

1143
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,960
you know at the viice level and then at

1144
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,880
intermed intermediate levels of the

1145
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,640
hierarchy you know one uh long-standing

1146
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,160
problem in this field was how to make

1147
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,400
dense enough uh memories such that uh

1148
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,359
the Fab area isn't totally dominated

1149
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,920
just by memory area your logic's very

1150
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,040
efficient um I personally think we have

1151
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,240
probably solved these problems uh or or

1152
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,359
a couple of things in the pipeline will

1153
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,160
solve this problem and I the secondary

1154
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:26,559
problem is is just that Hardware

1155
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,640
development in general takes some time

1156
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,880
right you know you design a chip that

1157
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,079
takes you maybe a month or two to figure

1158
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,359
out how to do that and get it to the

1159
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:34,640
state that it's uh clean enough you can

1160
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,960
go into Fab and you're pretty sure that

1161
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,079
it's going to work if it's a large scale

1162
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,559
chip and then you know fabrication takes

1163
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,160
a few months and testing takes a month

1164
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,240
or something like that and so you know

1165
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,160
at this point we're at the scale of

1166
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,880
multi-bit parallel multiplies and things

1167
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,160
like that and I think you know one or

1168
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,680
two iterations from them is is large

1169
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,160
scale processor so I I think we're not

1170
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,640
too far behind but that time constant is

1171
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,520
relevant okay thanks um yes so let's

1172
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,359
take one from the audience do Legacy

1173
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,119
architecture such as seos limit the

1174
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,400
potential of new materials such as

1175
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,520
ferroelectrics in microelectronics is

1176
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,559
there a balance between Progressive and

1177
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,559
disruptive design

1178
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,280
here right so I mean the way I kind of

1179
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,920
see this playing out I think I think the

1180
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,040
right approach is to be as disruptive as

1181
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,520
possible in University settings and in

1182
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,720
laboratory settings and the industry

1183
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,040
will kind of

1184
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,920
um pick out and and define the

1185
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,720
Progressive way to integrate them at

1186
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,440
scale um the good thing about seos is

1187
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,520
especially at this phase it is a mature

1188
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,000
technology we understand the physics

1189
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,559
quite well we understand the

1190
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,440
architectures quite well there are many

1191
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:48,359
modalities of architectures now where

1192
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,880
maybe integrating new materials on a

1193
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:54,040
nanowire device at 18 angstroms is

1194
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,359
really hard but oh if we put this in at

1195
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,640
45 nmet or a 90 nmet node we can unlock

1196
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,760
new capabilities that even those very

1197
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,800
highly Advanced chips don't have that's

1198
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,960
one of the approaches you know with this

1199
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,119
ferroelectric fet it's it's going to

1200
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,079
enable new capabilities this

1201
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:14,280
non-volatile memory element doesn't

1202
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:16,880
exist in in the same way in current seos

1203
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,040
architectures so it is a new device to

1204
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,720
be considered in addition to transistors

1205
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,280
capacitors and resistors that we can now

1206
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,839
build into circuits and and think about

1207
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,599
how you know that in my opinion

1208
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,720
Progressive change of just adding

1209
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,599
another element to the gate stack how

1210
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,400
that Progressive change can actually

1211
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:37,319
deliver some disruptive outcomes yeah so

1212
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,839
just to dig into that a little bit more

1213
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:42,920
are there examples now of um inmemory

1214
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,680
compute architectures maybe with

1215
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,480
volatile device as opposed to a

1216
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,880
nonvolatile device that at least the

1217
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,559
architecture is proven and are there the

1218
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,760
expected decrease in energy consumption

1219
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,920
yes yes so um the way that kind of in

1220
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,480
memory comp compute circuits are built

1221
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,319
today is with static random access

1222
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,119
memory and it is possible but it's uh

1223
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,720
very power inefficient there's a huge

1224
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:12,359
power draw because you're having to um

1225
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,760
in parallel power at least you know

1226
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:17,520
16 transistors in order to just do one

1227
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,119
bit of operation in that cell so if you

1228
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,920
start multiplying that out and you need

1229
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,160
to power all of these uh circuits in

1230
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,200
parallel it's something that you can do

1231
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:30,440
on a on a data center scale something we

1232
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,920
can't do on any Edge device right so in

1233
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,440
some sense the architecture is proven

1234
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,359
it's just that the device technology

1235
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,119
hasn't caught up to the potential for

1236
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,079
that architecture yeah I I think that's

1237
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,280
right that you're Marrying an

1238
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,280
application and a demand to kind of a

1239
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,559
new way of doing it that's more energy

1240
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,319
efficient okay and so now if we pose the

1241
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:52,680
same question to Alex so here of course

1242
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,000
you're you know wiping the SL clean so

1243
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,760
to speak starting with the new state

1244
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,960
variable and all the way up um but you

1245
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:06,000
know the computational Paradigm that has

1246
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,960
been matured with the seos underpinnings

1247
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,119
is very powerful and so yet we don't

1248
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,400
want to abandon that so how do we marry

1249
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:16,079
this disruption with the goodness of the

1250
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,599
M the mature seos ecosystem yeah I think

1251
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,240
superc conductors are exotic enough that

1252
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:23,960
um it's important to keep the highle

1253
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,079
system architecture you know somewhat

1254
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,280
similar to seos so that people can still

1255
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,920
you know so that

1256
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,760
the uh machine code that your C compiler

1257
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,760
sends to still things like do a multiply

1258
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,280
do an add go you know retrieve something

1259
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,000
for memory just to limit the barrier to

1260
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,319
entry you know that being said the

1261
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,640
lowlevel circuits uh you know in many

1262
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,000
cases are are implemented totally

1263
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:49,760
differently even in this in this case of

1264
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,880
a a memory I think a great example is um

1265
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,440
superconductors because they are quite

1266
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,520
low loss in data transmission so if if

1267
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,559
you you know switch something just long

1268
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,559
enough to create one uh one single flux

1269
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:03,960
Quantum pulse it could go around in

1270
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,319
circles uh with quite little loss in a

1271
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,000
superc conducting wire and so it turns

1272
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:08,640
out that delay line memories in superc

1273
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,119
conductors are extremely dense and

1274
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,680
efficient uh whereas you know they

1275
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,160
historically actually existed in some of

1276
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,400
the earliest computers back in the 50s

1277
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,000
60s uh using acoustic delay line

1278
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,319
memories with Mercury tubes and things

1279
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,400
like this um but in superc conductors

1280
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:24,280
again there you know some of these

1281
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,160
unusual architecture choices that

1282
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,880
existed back when we had other materials

1283
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,440
make sense again um to the to the folks

1284
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,240
that eventually have to write P torch

1285
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,200
code and and you know run models on

1286
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,880
these things that should be abstracted

1287
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,480
away but I think there's a lot of room

1288
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,400
for architectural innovation in superc

1289
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,920
conductors okay thanks

1290
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,000
so how much would the helium Supply

1291
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,040
limit the expansion of superconducting

1292
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,640
computing is there a more readily

1293
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,040
available high temperature alternative

1294
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,040
uh

1295
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,400
so we do have some systems that rely on

1296
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,200
a awful lot of helium some of the

1297
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,000
accelerators large particle accelerators

1298
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,319
rely on superconducting magnets and

1299
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,480
there's an awful lot of liquid helium

1300
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:09,400
that goes into those systems uh to cool

1301
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:13,000
them down um so I don't know the details

1302
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,440
on this but helium is limited resource

1303
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,960
um and I imagine if we wanted to get to

1304
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,920
a paradigm where all of our data centers

1305
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,839
relied on liquid helium because the most

1306
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,760
efficient way to cool these systems is

1307
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:27,799
actually to embed all of the circuitry

1308
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,559
in a bath of helium and then as it boils

1309
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:32,839
off you reliquify it and that's the most

1310
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,960
efficient way to cool these down however

1311
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:38,359
there are some

1312
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,079
closed circuit systems uh that that

1313
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:42,680
don't require that liquid helium uh and

1314
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,040
and they're a little more efficient yeah

1315
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,720
at at data center scale the helium

1316
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,160
reification plants that are used for

1317
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,000
particle accelerators is they're like

1318
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,559
essentially the same thing same same

1319
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,599
power draw um those could be used that's

1320
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:56,240
convenient because somebody already

1321
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:58,000
built all this infrastructure and

1322
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,920
there's infrastructure for Clos cycle

1323
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,480
helium C coolers all the way down to uh

1324
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,040
you know a couple hundred mows of

1325
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,119
cooling at 4

1326
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,280
Kelvin which you know is like a rack

1327
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,280
mount box you can buy from M yeah so so

1328
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,640
they're so yeah so so right now there

1329
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,079
are solutions to it and we're not helium

1330
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,000
limited I think even at the scale of a

1331
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,440
couple of enormous data centers we would

1332
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,079
not be limited this sort of comparable

1333
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,599
to particle accelerators that you know

1334
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,040
that said there is uh additionally a

1335
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,960
path which looks maybe a little bit more

1336
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,119
like the more law scaling path so we we

1337
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,400
don't have Denard scaling smaller

1338
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,520
devices don't get more efficient uh but

1339
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,920
if we go up in temperature devices do

1340
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,480
get more efficient because cryocoolers

1341
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,359
do worse and worse relative to Carno or

1342
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,359
perfect efficiency the colder they get

1343
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,000
um and so we're working on materials

1344
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,319
like nium nitride folks are working on

1345
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,760
nium Ty nitride and there's paths you

1346
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:52,040
know potentially to things like some

1347
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,160
demos have been done even ybco at 77

1348
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,559
Kelvin um so there's a path to continue

1349
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,319
to go to higher and higher temperature

1350
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:59,200
superc conductors

1351
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:00,720
uh which also improves our Energy

1352
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,400
Efficiency and reduces Reliance on

1353
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,640
things like liquid

1354
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,400
helium

1355
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,119
right okay so I don't know that I

1356
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,440
understand this top question how can the

1357
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:14,079
comp human computer be applied to Next

1358
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,799
Generation Computing to prevent excess

1359
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,400
energy consumption is

1360
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:22,200
it I'm not as good at Matrix multipli as

1361
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,240
in my head as

1362
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,960
a as an Nvidia h100

1363
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,160
unfortunately so so maybe you know but

1364
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,839
that's an interesting architectural

1365
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,280
question what what am I what am I doing

1366
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,000
that the h100 is not maybe we can

1367
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,920
reframe all the problems and I can just

1368
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,480
uh un chat gbt for you yeah it is

1369
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:42,640
interesting you you look at the image

1370
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,720
recognition speech recognition that

1371
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,440
we're all capable of it's pretty

1372
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,920
impressive if you compare that to the

1373
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,520
power that's required compared to the

1374
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,960
h100 from Nvidia and we're doing it on

1375
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:57,720
like 20 watts and so I think it is

1376
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:59,400
instructive to look to biology and sort

1377
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,799
out you know what's going on here what's

1378
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,480
the piece that we're missing in the way

1379
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:05,079
that we currently design

1380
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,559
architectures um and circuits and I

1381
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:09,119
think it's it's very exciting research

1382
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,640
of nor morphic Computing um dendritic

1383
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,480
learning all of these are very

1384
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,880
interesting Pathways and um I think we

1385
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,160
have we need creativity

1386
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,040
um it's attractive to stay in the same

1387
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,559
line of thinking with seas because

1388
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,240
there's so much industry behind it but I

1389
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:26,920
think the more creative we can be to

1390
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:30,359
come up with new ideas on how actually

1391
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:32,559
fabricate novel circuits that may mimic

1392
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:34,119
um the way our brains work you know we

1393
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,119
might be able to make these energy

1394
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:38,799
efficient advances yeah my this so this

1395
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,200
is like a little bit out there uh but

1396
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,760
I'll just throw it out for fun my

1397
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,200
understanding more or less of of of why

1398
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,040
things like biological systems are very

1399
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,640
efficient is because you know all right

1400
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,359
in a normal digital system you have some

1401
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,839
Channel and you know Shannon's Channel

1402
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,200
capacity theorem says we want if we want

1403
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,400
to put as much information on that

1404
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,839
channel as possible we should encode

1405
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,799
digital information just ones and zeros

1406
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,160
um but if you want to send the same

1407
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:00,280
amount of information with less energy

1408
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,720
cost then you can send you can use more

1409
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,280
symbols and so you could use like a

1410
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,640
unary code where you only send a bit

1411
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,480
once in a while and you know it's sort

1412
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,040
of time bin coded so that that sparse uh

1413
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,119
information codes lots of bits at once

1414
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,760
and so in big 3D networks you actually

1415
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,599
have lots more Channel capacity than you

1416
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,240
need and so you can very sparsely encode

1417
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,839
your information and you know people I

1418
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,599
think even from the sort of neural

1419
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:24,079
network perspective sort of believe that

1420
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:27,200
sparsely connected 3D networks are much

1421
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,160
more efficient than uh than densely

1422
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,240
coded networks or 2D networks so I I

1423
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,280
think that's sort of where it comes from

1424
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,240
it's hard to replicate that in

1425
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,440
microelectronics so uh but maybe we can

1426
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,880
think of ways to sure well so sort of on

1427
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,599
that theme um question these two

1428
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,240
technologies are still rooted in digital

1429
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,520
Computing do we think that analog

1430
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,559
Computing will play a role in the future

1431
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:52,400
for example materials that

1432
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,400
perform Matrix Vector

1433
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,160
multiplications so uh yeah I can I can I

1434
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,119
can note that talk to that a little bit

1435
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,280
uh thing number one is that the most

1436
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,040
expensive part of this Computing is

1437
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,520
still things like memory access uh and

1438
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,880
it's important to get dense memory as

1439
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,839
close to your processing uh to minimize

1440
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,200
overall you know energy cost to talk

1441
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:17,359
between these two objects um so it turns

1442
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,839
out actually in this in this qfp case

1443
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:22,319
that thing I showed you this majority

1444
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:23,720
gate uh we think of it as a three input

1445
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:28,920
digital majority gate but if you

1446
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:31,039
actually send uh amplitude coded data uh

1447
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,559
you can get like a 4- bit multiply

1448
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:36,680
accumulate out of that same object for

1449
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:38,240
for free the downside of that is okay

1450
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,200
now you have an extremely cheap multiply

1451
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,480
accumulate but it's still just as

1452
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,920
expensive to get data from the memory

1453
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,400
and that already costs you 10 times more

1454
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:49,280
than doing that bit level uh single bit

1455
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:52,720
majority gate and so the in contrast I

1456
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:55,240
would say where analog uh coding could

1457
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,119
potentially be used uh would be things

1458
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,000
in like for example L line memories like

1459
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,599
un coding is very easy to use in that

1460
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,240
case where we decide where are we going

1461
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:05,559
to store the pulse uh and and time code

1462
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,400
that right now we're again still limited

1463
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:09,920
by density and so uh that's not the the

1464
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,640
most efficient way to use it but if we

1465
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,920
end up you know where we have more

1466
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,280
channels than we need that would that

1467
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,000
would be another way to push energy for

1468
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,240
sure yeah yes so I think just going back

1469
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,559
to that hierarchical model for

1470
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,599
computation that sure analog Computing

1471
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,559
is interesting I think it is useful for

1472
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,520
some classes of operations um or or

1473
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,720
computations and you know there is you

1474
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:38,400
know as we look higher into that that

1475
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:40,240
stack uh more know the so-called domain

1476
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,880
specific accelerators where if you're

1477
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,559
willing to limit the types of problems

1478
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,960
you want to solve with your computation

1479
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:51,200
system you can tailor that stack to be

1480
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:54,160
very efficient for those and so there is

1481
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,960
a lot that we can trade and doing analog

1482
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,079
computation is certainly one of those

1483
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:02,359
trades doing Quantum computation is

1484
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:05,440
another but what you're giving up is the

1485
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:08,240
generality of what that machine can work

1486
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,400
on um and the reason the Von Norman has

1487
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,079
been so successful is that it is so

1488
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,079
versatile uh but but as we learn you

1489
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:16,760
know we need to get beyond that for some

1490
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:19,359
of these harder problems that we want to

1491
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,079
solve yeah I I might add one thing it's

1492
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,799
interesting to think as when I showed

1493
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:24,920
that dted Intel chip and they're already

1494
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:28,200
doing

1495
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,880
multi-tile um chips and this is getting

1496
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,119
toward that 2.5d

1497
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,000
integration this is interesting to Think

1498
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,680
Through you as we think about the

1499
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,760
architectures that are married together

1500
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,720
through chiplet integration you could

1501
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,400
think about having a Leading Edge chip

1502
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,880
in the digital form factor have

1503
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:50,760
integrating analog compute RF compute

1504
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:55,319
all in the same um platform and so I

1505
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:57,880
think that these various approaches will

1506
00:57:55,319 --> 00:58:00,480
start integ together and it won't be

1507
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:04,280
this or that but we might have many

1508
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:07,280
capabilities on on one chip on one

1509
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,280
package

1510
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,799
okay so there was a question um so maybe

1511
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,520
I'll just pick up from the do we think

1512
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:21,480
the Next Generation Computing is startup

1513
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:26,240
friendly sector um maybe it is tough

1514
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:28,280
Tech right uh I think that

1515
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,240
there's certainly some possibilities um

1516
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,480
it probably needs a few more years of

1517
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,640
maturation uh some kind of a Foundry

1518
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,880
process into what you could design but

1519
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,079
there's certainly lots of opportunity uh

1520
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,200
in this space especially the

1521
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:46,799
superconducting uh electronic space

1522
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,680
that you know it has received so little

1523
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:53,200
attention compared to what the seos

1524
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,680
architecture or a paradigm has that

1525
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,039
there is lots of room for Discovery and

1526
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,119
innovation

1527
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,039
that I think could revolutionize the

1528
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,119
field there's anything Yeah Yeah from

1529
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:05,520
the from the Fab side super Condor

1530
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:07,920
Electronics is probably a little bit

1531
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,480
lower barrier to entry than than Coss

1532
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,960
because we're dealing with sort of 99

1533
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,680
meter Fab nodes at this point and we

1534
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,520
don't have um an energy requirement to

1535
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,839
push to you know dense subnanometer Fab

1536
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,799
nodes um on the seos side I think there

1537
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:22,680
are plenty of people who work um you

1538
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,480
know an architecture level innovations

1539
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:28,240
that tape out to tsmc Etc and and that's

1540
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,839
you know maybe within the seos domain

1541
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:35,280
but in some cases people have uh used

1542
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,720
seos processes and and somewhat new ways

1543
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,440
so yeah yes so maybe with that we'll

1544
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,559
conclude the session by saying first

1545
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,079
we're very pleased to be part of the the

1546
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:48,760
Nano Community um not a lot of people

1547
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:51,359
know about us up in in Lexington but um

1548
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,680
you know we're very accessible uh very

1549
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:58,359
much want to collaborate with startups

1550
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:00,680
with you know researchers with companies

1551
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:03,119
um so uh we have lots of different

1552
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:06,440
mechanisms that we can use to do those

1553
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,880
collaborations uh so um please you know

1554
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,039
let's let's engage if you have some

1555
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:13,140
ideas um in in any ways that you can

1556
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:18,480
imagine so thank

1557
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:18,480
[Applause]

1558
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,960
you for
