00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,359
hello I want to give a sense of how some

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,560
problem sets are going to work or the

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,279
majority of the time generally speaking

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,279
you'll be given some instructions on

5
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,640
what to do like write a routine that

6
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,760
takes a string representing in harmonic

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,119
with minus sign for Flats we'll talk

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,559
about that in a bit and number sign for

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,000
sharps and rning a new string that is an

10
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:40,120
n and harmonic you're not allowed to

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,920
change it but I can here that is an and

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,480
harmonic of the pitch you will be given

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,559
valid input only I will always tell you

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,199
if you have to check for invalid input

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,920
um if there's more than one valid

16
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,399
inharmonic you can give any inharmonic

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,640
up to double Flats of shuts then below

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,399
you're going to be

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,640
giving um the name of the routine that

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,519
you're going to need write along with um

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,400
usually the name of a variable that you

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,119
should

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,040
use and the type if you haven't looked

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,080
at python typing this can be really

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,799
exciting and what's

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,159
output at this point you need to define

27
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,880
the routine what often you can take some

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,640
of the language from above but make it

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,240
in your own words to see uh what

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,600
happened but put it in the active uh

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,960
voice takes in a string representing a

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:45,360
pitch sorry I should say representing a

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,360
pitch earlier U and returns a valid and

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:54,399
harmonic for

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:57,159
it um if there's specific things that

36
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,759
constrain what the valid input might be

37
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll tend to write it here or you should

38
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,399
be writing it in

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,439
we write for humans to read not just for

40
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,000
computers to process so it's always

41
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,280
going to be important that uh that your

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,879
code be documented and that your

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,680
variable names be things that humans can

44
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:23,560
understand okay so then you can go ahead

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,519
and write your code and if you're uh not

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,840
so great programmer maybe you'll start

47
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:33,840
with if and harmonic in is

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,319
the flat we then use minus signs for

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,159
flat return

50
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,599
DP otherwise return C Shar and at least

51
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,400
maybe you'll get it right

52
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,200
sometimes

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:55,080
great now I will sometimes give you one

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,640
or two test cases so maybe I'll say

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,120
assert FP and

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,799
harmonic E flat

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,799
equals

58
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:09,239
gar and can see that that

59
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:12,840
works maybe if I'm very nice I'll give

60
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,840
you two of them up and you can see that

61
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,159
doesn't

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,760
work I am not going to give you all of

63
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:26,080
the interesting and

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,840
fun test cases part of the thought

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,760
process of this class part of why you

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,360
get humani credit is is that you need to

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,519
be thinking about well what are the

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,959
weird cases okay uh I can put it if it

69
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,159
this it's E flat and if it's dsharp it's

70
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,280
E flat and so on oh

71
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,560
but we going to need to make sure

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
that this

73
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,280
works or maybe I need to make sure

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,920
that that

75
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
works or at least that it's a valued

76
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,680
answer

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,079
ha and so part of what you need to do is

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,120
be thinking about how do we write test

79
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,879
code what are the test cases that

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,239
Professor cord is going to be putting in

81
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,840
such that it's going to challenge how I

82
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,919
write you'll probably need to rewrite

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,919
your code as you go great let's get

84
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,919
started
