Introducing Dr. Harold E. Edgerton of

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
the Massachusetts Institute of

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,599
Technology. His strooscope light, my

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,280
friends, is really something. [music]

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,520
While normally film runs through the

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,800
average movie camera at 90 ft a minute,

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,960
Edgudan's flicker box can handle 125 ft

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,279
a second. Connected with it is the unit

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
containing the thyrtron amplifier

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,400
flashing on and off up to 2,000 times a

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,079
second. So, it is now possible to get

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
ultra slow motion pictures. [music] In

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,320
normal speed movies, a bullet shot from

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
the muzzle of a high-powered air gun is

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
invisible. Now, Edgedan really

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,000
photographs a bullet in flight. [music]

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,239
And when you recall that all the action

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,850
of this bulb smashing actually took

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,079
place in the fraction of a second,

21
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,360
[music] you realize that here is speed

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,280
in movie photography. Indeed.
