2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:23,199
the idea is to take some hypothetical

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,960
situations that you've either seen in

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,439
the movies read about or been in

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,160
depending on your experience in the

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,800
public sector ask you at tables to think

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,239
of your best advice to the people in the

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,399
situation in each hypothetical effective

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,280
leadership in the public sector we are

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,600
asserting requires different strategies

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,480
behaviors and

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,280
qualifications than effective leadership

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,640
in the private sector the key difference

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,480
is being able to facilitate consensus

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,400
building decisions made by all not just

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,439
by the leader they know how to provide

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,159
Direction without taking control

18
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,479
empowering others to make decisions and

19
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,960
helping to resolve conflict among

20
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,119
stakeholders and interest groups and we

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,200
talked about doing those things as a

22
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,960
form of service we alluded to but didn't

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,600
get into much

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,360
detail about

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,520
facilitation RIS responsibilities both

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,000
at the

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,159
table where you're trying to work with a

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,920
group and away from the table on behalf

29
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,960
of the group before the group comes

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,320
together there are things that the

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,719
facilitative leader can do must do to

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,399
make the chances of succeeding when they

33
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,840
are together at the table

34
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,880
increase at the table and away from the

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,200
table we'll be using that

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,320
phraseology the next several sessions

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,840
and we talked about facilitative leaders

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,160
who both encourage

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,560
advocacy on the part of the people

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,319
they're working with and

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,319
inquiry on the part of

42
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,519
participants and that's not easy to do

43
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,519
some

44
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,280
people find that their advocacy impedes

45
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,800
their

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,480
capacity to inquire enabling discussion

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,200
of undiscussable issues you want to

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,720
provide leadership in the public Arena

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,000
and you're assisting a group there are

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,519
things that they really need to talk

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,400
about if they're going to reach any kind

52
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,560
of informed agreement when a

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,360
facilitative leaders seeks to bring a

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,760
group into a conversation about things

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,360
which for some of the people very

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,400
uncomfortable how do they do it it's

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,200
part of the facilitative service that

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,519
they provide they have to know how to

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,920
make the undiscussable discussable any

60
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,840
hope of working through and resolving

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,239
their

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,280
disagreements hinges on moving all of

63
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:30,400
the participants in a public

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,200
dialogue from positions to interest

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,319
not a guarantee that that's going to get

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,720
you to

67
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,400
agreement but if all people are doing is

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,080
repeating their

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,959
demands you're not going to get anywhere

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,799
a facilitative leader seeks unanimity

71
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,080
but settles for overwhelming agreement

72
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,720
you don't vote you're not interested in

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,400
what the majority wants and the reason

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,560
if you say unanimity is the measure of

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,319
the decision you invite black

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,680
you have some actors in the group whose

77
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,360
primary objective is to sabotage the

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,400
group and they're happy with that in

79
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,079
many quarters of the world people think

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,239
of this as the UN

81
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,479
problem you're saying we can't do

82
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,560
anything unless everybody agrees and

83
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,560
some oh good we're still on that that's

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,560
great that'll mean nothing or bad will

85
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,560
happen that I don't

86
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,840
like so here's the first scenario the

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,800
mayor has appointed a blue ribbon

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,560
committee to advise her on a new process

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,479
of public budgeting one that will ensure

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,680
greater public

91
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,880
engagement the mayor named a leading

92
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,280
corporate figure in the community the

93
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:58,360
CEO of the largest employer in the city

94
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,400
to chair or lead this advisory committee

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,759
there's an immediate back clash in the

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,759
press the community is convinced there's

97
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,800
no way this person should have been

98
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,840
named to be the leader of this group

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,160
question to you what's your advice to

100
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,639
the

101
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,479
CEO regarding a how to introduce himself

102
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,680
to the rest of the committee and the

103
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:28,120
public secondly how do you think the CEO

104
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,800
should prepare for the first meeting of

105
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,280
this committee and third how can the CEO

106
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,160
establish credibility with the other

107
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,639
members of the committee let alone the

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:45,280
community at large so we're looking for

109
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:50,880
your table's best advice to this CEO how

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:53,360
could this person Be an Effective

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,440
leader is it inappropriate to suggest

112
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,680
that he resign as that's what I was

113
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,600
thinking and not necessarily from the

114
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,840
whole committee like

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,919
but then like are they still a leader

116
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,720
after that I feel like that could be

117
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,680
contentious it kind of like you know

118
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
like it feels like a little bit of a

119
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,800
slap in the face of the mayor I mean it

120
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,639
is a budgetary committee and I do think

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,599
there's like a lot that the public

122
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,599
sector learn in some ways from the

123
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,560
private sector what is his commitment to

124
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,000
the community how is his business give

125
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,919
it back to the community maybe taking a

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
back seat on like the next couple

127
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,319
meetings kind of just saying like I'm

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,680
here everyone layer ideas out the table

129
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,199
so maybe have dominating meetings as

130
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,599
much as could or they could but

131
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,360
eventually he's the chair I agree like

132
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,199
he cannot dominate but he will be asked

133
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,560
to intervene at some point if his role

134
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,160
is a facilitator like at the end of the

135
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,639
meeting like giving giving that like

136
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,680
unbiased summary of like what's

137
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,599
happening it's not skewing anything or

138
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,919
only pulling out the opinions he he

139
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,360
agrees with but really like giving a

140
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,000
summary of like everything that was

141
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,360
covered at this table um we threw out a

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,919
couple of um sort of different options

143
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,879
kind of mostly centered on the question

144
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,800
of how does how does this person

145
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,960
establish credibility right off the bat

146
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,639
in the first meeting what can be done

147
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,720
and then will here had a great idea

148
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,520
which was what if the person sets up

149
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,280
meetings beforehand with a

150
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,960
representative sample from this

151
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,960
committee so that when everyone does

152
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,639
show up to this first initial meeting

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,120
those people can see that the CEO person

154
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,960
has taken their advice on board and has

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,440
listened to their their concerns and

156
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,759
their thoughts we were discussing and

157
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,639
biani spearheaded the idea of

158
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,560
recognizing the backlash that is

159
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,680
preceding this CEO trying to not subvert

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,159
the backlash but address it headon in a

161
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,800
one-on-one setting that allows someone

162
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,159
in a structured format to air their

163
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,759
grievances but also their interests so

164
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,759
that you aren't entering into the first

165
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,479
committee meeting in sort of like a a

166
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,800
cacophonous room full of maybe miscon

167
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,440
ception stereotypes not only in a sense

168
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,440
of like establishing credibility but

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
also from a purely like facilitative

170
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,199
standpoint I don't want to say control

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,280
the narrative but maybe set the record

172
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,919
straight from where they intend to come

173
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,280
in we were talking along kind of similar

174
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,360
lines about this role of transparency

175
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,199
specifically in the first meeting for

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,159
the CEO to go in and very clearly

177
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,479
delineate what their expertise is within

178
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,080
this setting and what their expertise is

179
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,000
not and so in that sense open in up

180
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,919
space for the other members of the

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,320
committee to take on leadership roles in

182
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,039
sharing their own expertise and also

183
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,599
creates an opportunity as well for the

184
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,160
CEO to express his own interest and true

185
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,360
desire to learn from the other members

186
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,480
of the council and from the community as

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,920
a whole one of the things we were

188
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,920
talking about not necessarily hearing

189
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
from folks before the first meeting but

190
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
really using that first meeting to kind

191
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,720
of establish guidelines checks and

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,880
balances systems and the process that's

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,320
going to come about um to really kind of

194
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,200
focus around trust building and

195
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,839
Coalition building during that first

196
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,320
meeting or first several meetings like

197
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,680
really taking an unbiased view of like

198
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,160
taking notes and listening to all of the

199
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,440
different people who are in that room

200
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,600
and then giving a very unbiased feedback

201
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
or like recap of that um and so then

202
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
people begin to understand that they can

203
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,920
you know voice their opinions voice

204
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,000
their thoughts without anything being

205
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,680
kind of overlooked or brushed over

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,560
because they're not in agreement with

207
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,399
this leader identifying himself as a

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,279
human being and not just this kind of

209
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,920
powerful figure and then being really

210
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,399
clear about you know how he will be held

211
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,480
accountable and how you know this

212
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,120
process will work I'm curious to hear

213
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,480
thoughts on this whether it would be

214
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,399
appropriate given how

215
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,160
poorly uh the process started for this

216
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,200
CEO in the first meeting to offer

217
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,040
voluntarily to resign as chair I don't

218
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,160
know off like say anyone else in the

219
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,399
room we can come up with a new process

220
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,360
for finding a new chair but then we also

221
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,920
talked about maybe that would be

222
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,519
insulting to the mayor in this context

223
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,360
resigning you know and leaving that just

224
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,480
confirms the fact this was the wrong

225
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,839
person to take on a leadership role in

226
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,760
the public sector but

227
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:21,120
possibility is

228
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,680
changed if they recognize the danger of

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,360
proceeding in the way the people are

230
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,200
immediately upset about and they say not

231
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,959
an assistant a

232
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,720
co-chair and they have to make sure

233
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,639
before they put the mayor in the

234
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,480
position of announcing that that the

235
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,760
coaches will be able to work together so

236
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,519
then they're delivering to the mayor a

237
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,240
proposal that's already been worked out

238
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,519
that that's how I would respond to the

239
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
resigning

240
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,760
idea it's interesting that it becomes

241
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,399
about who the CEO is and why they were

242
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,480
appointed rather than who the mayor is

243
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,760
and why they appointed that way and I

244
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,279
think it it's more reflective of

245
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,959
actually what the mayor wants and how

246
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,959
they wish to lead if they're going to

247
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,959
appoint a CEO theoretically based on the

248
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,560
fact that they think this person can

249
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:09,720
operate this steering committee from a

250
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,079
hierarchical point of view how is it

251
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,680
reflective of the mayor and what they

252
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,600
want and how they wish to lead and what

253
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,440
sort of leadership stance they

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,680
prioritize actually makes me want to put

255
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,120
the attention on that person versus like

256
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,760
the person who's appointed and how they

257
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,279
need to then figure out what to do in

258
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,639
order to to deal with someone else's

259
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,680
decision about

260
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:35,480
them if you ask ask what's it take to Be

261
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,040
an Effective leader in the public sector

262
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,519
I would argue more than whatever the

263
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,959
skill is and the experience is that work

264
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:51,160
for you in the private sector some other

265
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:53,959
additional ways of building trust as a

266
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,440
way of establishing credibility and not

267
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:01,120
assuming you can count on your title and

268
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,000
your history as a source of credibility

269
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,800
I had imagined we would be through

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,639
several scenarios by now and I don't

271
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,040
want to keep you from dinner while

272
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,760
you're having dinner I will ask you to

273
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:16,720
talk about a second

274
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,680
scenario so I'm going to uh switch the

275
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,279
context in this

276
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,560
scenario scenario takes place in a

277
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:29,279
different city different metropolitan

278
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,560
area in one of the inner suburbs

279
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,880
the school

280
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,839
committee being attacked from all sides

281
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,720
the teachers have voted no confidence in

282
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,760
the superintendent the teachers union is

283
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,279
demanding that the superintendent resign

284
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,760
the elected school committee is

285
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,920
divided some backing the

286
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,839
superintendent and some supporting the

287
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,120
teachers union there are a whole raft of

288
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,959
policies behind this that are dividing

289
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,160
the

290
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,120
community when whether current efforts

291
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,440
to ensure student safety in the

292
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,839
buildings are adequate who's to blame

293
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,720
for the very low scores on Statewide

294
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,360
exams in this city as compared to other

295
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,680
schools in nearby cities the need for

296
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,959
either more or less parental control

297
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,040
over the content of the K through six

298
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,079
curriculum whether or not more

299
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,199
investment should be made in advanced

300
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,680
courses for the most gifted students the

301
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,639
desirability of mainstreaming versus or

302
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,360
rather than separating special needs

303
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,920
students all these issues this division

304
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,360
sharp

305
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,360
division between teachers and the

306
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,040
superintendent between and amongst

307
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,639
teachers

308
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,279
amongst family members what's your best

309
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,759
advice to this

310
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,560
superintendent under this

311
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,920
circumstance given all of this all of

312
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,440
this hostility all all of this

313
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:07,320
difficulty how would you help this

314
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:10,199
person get things back on a useful track

315
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,600
as the leader in the schools and

316
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:15,959
education area in this community so the

317
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,040
idea is to have table discussion and

318
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,560
then we'll see where you come out and

319
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,680
see if we get any differences in my

320
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,600
previous job we talked a lot about

321
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,279
making sure that like we come in with a

322
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,079
clear goal and like like what is

323
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,759
actionable from like this feedback like

324
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
not just going in general get feedback

325
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,959
but like coming in with concrete ways

326
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,639
that the feedback can actually be used

327
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:38,000
setting expectations like this is what

328
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,800
we can change this is what we can't side

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,360
the conversation could impact that

330
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,160
probably better to just be un FR with

331
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,959
like what's in our realm as right now

332
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,079
and even like short-term long what could

333
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,240
we change this year what would we need

334
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,880
to work on that will probably take 10

335
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,399
your own workers who are not believing

336
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,360
in you like their trust is completely

337
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,839
lost in you and it depends on them for

338
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,399
your whatever plan you have to be

339
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,240
successful they're not feeling hurt or

340
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,720
they're not having you know vested trust

341
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,959
in their their quote unquote leader that

342
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,959
you know creating mechanisms for um kind

343
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,839
of Distributing that that leadership

344
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:21,279
amongst the teachers you know I would

345
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:24,000
first see what the problem I would after

346
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,120
that I'm going to be like okay now let

347
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,199
me get a team of experts all the issues

348
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,480
that were highlighted to be I would try

349
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,079
to solve the

350
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,959
issues and like give that confidence to

351
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,959
whoever cares about it I'm going to use

352
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,560
say the next 6 months to remedy this and

353
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,839
you will see this kind of change and

354
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,680
like make these kind of short-term goals

355
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,120
for people to gain confidence in them

356
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,680
account I think the makeup of those

357
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,079
boards doesn't have to be like the

358
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,279
people who brought it up at the you

359
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,399
know whoever is most qualified to be

360
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,079
yeah like what are the

361
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,720
pivotable are plac like where change

362
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,000
could be made are they the right person

363
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,639
to do it so like what does res me like

364
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,759
it doesn't even have to necessarily be

365
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,880
immediate what is a succession thing

366
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,120
look like how can I come someone else to

367
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,639
be able to take this on or point out who

368
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,519
I think should be able to see me if it's

369
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
clear that like I suspect that it might

370
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,759
not happen through like a presentation

371
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,120
or you telling people that but you

372
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:26,480
actually need to get people in the room

373
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,040
and then start guiding the conversation

374
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,360
towards this common realization we're

375
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,800
all here for the same thing right we all

376
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,160
want the same thing right the one thing

377
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,279
you could actually do is to get

378
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,720
representatives from this room um from

379
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,279
these different subcommittees in one

380
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,360
room and then you start to get them to

381
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,040
think together about Solutions it's like

382
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,759
oh if we mainstream these kids what's

383
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,680
going happen with these other resources

384
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,199
that are going to come from

385
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,480
mainstreaming them you know can we do

386
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,440
something with that just like collab get

387
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,120
them to collaborate with each other

388
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,319
interesting idea maybe having like

389
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,440
representatives of each interest part of

390
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:02,319
the committee like it's not

391
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,880
siloed by interest but it's like like a

392
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:07,199
representative Committee of all the

393
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,760
interests yeah that's they're forc to

394
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,640
talk with each other and that there

395
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,640
isn't this like arm wrestling between

396
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,520
the silos they would probably choose the

397
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,439
one who has the largest voice who's kind

398
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,839
of a fighter but but these kind of

399
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,600
people may not be good to putting a

400
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,840
negotiation uh process I think part of

401
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,080
being a facilitative leader is also

402
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,600
preparing each of these folks to be able

403
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,640
to best advocate for themselves so then

404
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,919
you go back to that oneon-one

405
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,360
relationship again so before you have

406
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,440
that meeting where you start to do the

407
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,520
collaboration you need to do

408
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,120
preparations with them but it's also

409
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,200
kind of difficult because they have

410
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,200
you're not biased towards any specific

411
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,039
concern so let's say safety of the

412
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,400
students in schools um k to6 curricula

413
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,880
um the mainstreaming of the special

414
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,880
needs students like you have to sure

415
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,960
you're not biased or every single one

416
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,080
that's the hard part yeah I think that

417
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,200
would also support the uh problem that

418
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,000
you're bringing up that you don't want

419
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,679
to just bring the guy the loudest voice

420
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,760
to the table you kind of want to give

421
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,120
others a chance that's part of

422
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,440
facilitating the process cuz you're

423
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,080
helping everyone improve the mindset of

424
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,919
being ready to

425
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,600
collaborate essentially a decision needs

426
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:25,440
to be made that's like in favor of one

427
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,520
party instead of the other I think

428
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,480
that's the part about pairing them and

429
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,520
then letting them do the negotiation

430
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,080
amongst themselves at the table kind of

431
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,240
builds that trust that you're not biased

432
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,400
because people are putting their own

433
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,559
skin in the game you're

434
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:49,400
not they sort of like bring order to the

435
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:50,799
space enforce rules bring things to yes

436
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,559
this

437
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,520
hypothetical is uh what the vast number

438
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,720
of people who see themselves as leaders

439
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,919
in the public sector are dealing with

440
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,840
daytoday these are the circumstances

441
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,039
that people are being prepared to work

442
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,679
in and when

443
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:14,919
conflict has overwhelmed whatever

444
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,080
forward movement somebody who thinks

445
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:23,200
their the leader has they have to have

446
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:26,640
some idea some strategy what do you do

447
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,600
when all this conflict has wrapped

448
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,640
itself around whatever the functional

449
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,919
responsibilities are were you trying to

450
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,679
think of ways of

451
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,679
resolving the conflict telling the

452
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,080
superintendent you can do this this this

453
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:47,520
and this to resolve the conflict were

454
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,760
you mostly thinking about talking to the

455
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,840
superintendent about how to proceed with

456
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,760
the work that needs to be done in spite

457
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,679
of the conflict you think that a leader

458
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:03,520
in this position can do something to

459
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,840
wipe the conflict away to resolve it if

460
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,440
not what are they supposed to do about

461
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,799
the work that's supposed to get done

462
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,520
it's completely

463
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:15,559
Frozen because everybody's at everybody

464
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,679
else's throat are they supposed to

465
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,200
mediate this all these different

466
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,720
disputes that they're the focus of I

467
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,720
know they can

468
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:29,440
resign it's not you don't have to

469
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,880
I number of years people are in

470
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,720
positions is getting shorter and shorter

471
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,840
in the public sector in the United

472
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,320
States and in other countries conflict

473
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,679
is om thepresent people either don't

474
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:48,400
know of a way to proceed in a leadership

475
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:52,080
role and trying to resolve the conflict

476
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,520
so they walk away or they're thrown

477
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,120
out because they don't appear to be able

478
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,960
to solve the conflict whether they leave

479
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,360
voluntar or not their term is short

480
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,840
because the

481
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,320
conflict is

482
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,960
overwhelming so our group um held that

483
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,200
you know there's accountability to

484
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,360
improving the system um and

485
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,559
accountability by the superintendent to

486
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,520
either acknowledge you know their role

487
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:26,840
in it um also to um either facilitate or

488
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,039
be adjacent to an ad hoc committee that

489
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,880
can facilitate a

490
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,200
Discovery process or audit of what

491
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,600
exactly has been going wrong within the

492
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,440
school system um even making

493
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,240
considerations for conducting uh like

494
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,120
investigations and interviewing with

495
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,679
other parts of the school system and key

496
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,480
stakeholders to um help facilitate a

497
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:55,320
transition process and um inheritance of

498
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,559
a new a better system that where we

499
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,320
understand the challenges that are going

500
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:04,159
on um and ways that can adjust moving

501
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:07,640
forward the superintendent still would

502
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:11,120
probably be recommended to to leave um

503
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,039
at that point um however I do think that

504
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,960
their institutional knowledge of the

505
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:19,840
issue is relevant to identifying the key

506
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,720
issues of the system do you believe that

507
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,320
if they could just solve one of these

508
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,880
conflicts and have it clear that it was

509
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,039
their doing that resolved it and they'd

510
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,799
be accepted in that role of trying to

511
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:38,480
resolve them because they resolve one

512
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:42,679
thing first yeah I mean I think it seems

513
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:46,320
to be a complex issue where there is um

514
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:49,200
pivot Points where there is the most uh

515
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,080
upside if it is resolved um so

516
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,279
potentially solving one and finding out

517
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,159
the the positive impact from that might

518
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,320
give a vote of confidence so you would

519
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:04,200
entertain that proposition that if they

520
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,760
can do something and actually take one

521
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,679
of these clear conflicts in the

522
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,440
community and get the people who are

523
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:16,200
primarily the key actors and secret them

524
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,320
away somewhere and help them work that

525
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,080
out and then come out together with them

526
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,600
and announce look we've solved this and

527
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,159
if we can solve this we can solve all of

528
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:32,360
our conflicts trust me not exactly

529
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,880
one I think it requires a more

530
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,240
comprehensive strategic approach but

531
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,679
solving a big issue first might be a

532
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,840
first pillar of or milestone for that

533
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,039
what about setting a lot of different

534
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,159
people in motion with responsibility for

535
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:52,679
trying to resolve or mediate different

536
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:54,960
disputes now there is not being the one

537
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:58,679
to resolve these

538
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,600
disputes but saying I have this person I

539
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:04,000
don't I don't know if they're loyal to

540
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,080
me or not but maybe they would say they

541
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,480
would accept responsibility over the

542
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,360
next six weeks for this particular

543
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,039
conflict between this group and this

544
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,200
group because they're close to both

545
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,640
sides and I'm asking them to see what

546
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,480
progress they can make and I'm giving

547
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,320
them authority to act on that and then

548
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,520
you've set a lot of different people

549
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,600
carefully chosen on the grounds that

550
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,159
there's no chance the superintendent can

551
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,919
solve all these problems they're the

552
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,640
source of most of them or at least the

553
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:43,559
symbolic source of most of them what I'm

554
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,039
asking is as you think about your

555
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:48,919
personal theory of practice and you have

556
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:52,480
one whether you confront it regularly

557
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,840
and build it or not you have one what do

558
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,640
you assume about the management of

559
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,279
conflict and the role of leadership

560
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:05,120
there are sides the union this and the

561
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,640
people who are managing the union I

562
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,600
found in real life as a person assigned

563
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,159
as a mediator from outside they don't

564
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,320
even know what they're fighting about

565
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:19,760
they're really really angry they'll tell

566
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,640
me a topic I'll sit with everybody

567
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,360
privately confidentially I'm just an

568
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,960
outsider I'm just asked to see if

569
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,840
there's any way to help there's no way

570
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,960
will accept the Librarians not having

571
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,520
the final control of which books go in

572
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,159
the library for K through six that's it

573
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,520
no chance no

574
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:47,799
way okay why what do you mean

575
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,960
why well couldn't there be an occasion

576
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,559
in which the Librarians mostly do this

577
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,960
but if somebody has a concern that the

578
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,600
Librarians and some other people have a

579
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,600
conversation about it and you can asked

580
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,600
for a chance to discuss this without

581
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,320
saying the only ones who make the

582
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,120
decision of the

583
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:13,159
Librarians we never did it that way I

584
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,480
know that but I'm trying to see whether

585
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:21,279
it's possible to invent a way forward

586
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,840
that meets your underlying interests

587
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,760
differently from what's been done in the

588
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,880
past well I don't know if my people will

589
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,960
accept it if I were to be in a

590
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,520
conversation where that was being

591
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,799
discussed well could we try it and see

592
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,720
right getting people to discuss the

593
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,799
undis what they think is

594
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,720
undiscussable how do you how can you

595
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:48,240
facilitate that we shifted to a

596
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,840
different um Direction and thought about

597
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,840
hiring experts or a technical Advisory

598
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,279
Group of sorts to work alongside the

599
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,840
superintendent on the issues that were

600
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,279
identified uh because

601
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,320
it's not that the superintendent can

602
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:04,080
solve it all I don't think the Advisory

603
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,039
Group or the experts can solve it all as

604
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,799
well what we discussed was to have

605
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:11,480
people who were more knowledgeable of

606
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,159
those particular issues and could have a

607
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,760
better understanding of how to solve

608
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,520
them and then we also talked about

609
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:22,080
releasing a memo of sorts which outlines

610
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:25,679
the plan of how the superintendent and

611
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,720
his team can tackle these issues uh

612
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,399
because what you were saying about oh if

613
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,880
the super intendant solves one issue

614
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,440
will that be enough for him to start

615
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,760
working on others and I think in a lot

616
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,600
of cases that is true uh because to gain

617
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,919
the trust back of these different

618
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,159
stakeholders even saying that okay I'm

619
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,600
starting to solve this one issue I mean

620
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:50,120
not one in like one issue but like

621
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,640
starting small I think is important to

622
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,080
gain the trust back of these

623
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,000
stakeholders so I think even starting

624
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,279
small definitely helps gain trusts of

625
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,440
communities and other like union leaders

626
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,519
and people yeah it's a highrisk strategy

627
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,559
to assume that if I could just find the

628
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:13,640
Lynch pin solve this one quickly then

629
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,159
everything's going to fit together my

630
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,840
hunch is in this particular kind of

631
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:24,399
story where the superintendent is

632
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:28,799
supposedly the administrative leader but

633
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:32,399
also is the object of the conflict for

634
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:36,240
many of the parties that waiting for

635
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:40,000
them to pick one of these disputes and

636
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,559
resolve it through their intervention so

637
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,679
they can wave a flag and say you can all

638
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:49,080
have confidence in me look I solve this

639
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,840
probably a losing strategy

640
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:56,039
whereas if the

641
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,080
superintendent could have private

642
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:01,320
conversations with a lot of the folks

643
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,440
who are complaining about something that

644
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,080
the superintendent's doing and say well

645
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,200
would you be willing to take

646
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,919
responsibility for the next period of

647
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,960
time of getting this this this and this

648
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,039
together and coming up with your

649
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,760
suggestion of what should be done

650
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,440
together I don't want to hear a summary

651
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,760
of what you disagree about I'm looking

652
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,519
for you to produce positive proposals

653
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,039
and nobody's tried to convene these

654
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,679
folks and I think they would trust you

655
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,600
to do that they're not making final

656
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,360
decisions they're making

657
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,320
suggestions together for ways are

658
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,679
resolving issues and if we could get a

659
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,559
half dozen different people if the

660
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:49,559
leader can

661
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:53,679
facilitate the engagement of other

662
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:54,600
participants and help build their role

663
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,200
in

664
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:01,640
leadership I'm arguing that the leaders

665
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,000
role is enhanced I think a lot of times

666
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,200
this strategy is used the one you're

667
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,240
describing but my problem with this is

668
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,880
that you're asking those people to do

669
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,279
more labor who are already experiencing

670
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,640
these problems and in a lot of cases

671
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,519
when I worked with uh communities

672
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,679
especially is that they do not want to

673
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,000
take responsibility because they're

674
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,399
already frustrated all these

675
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,360
stakeholders and then me going in as a

676
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:28,519
superintendent for example and saying oh

677
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,840
maybe you can help me solve this and

678
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,760
it's like but that's your job do do you

679
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,559
understand so I feel like it sometimes

680
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,480
puts a lot of blame and a lot of work

681
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,159
and a lot of labor on these different

682
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,960
stakeholders and my question is how to

683
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,640
address that how to approach this in a

684
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,640
way that it doesn't look like that

685
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,279
instead it looks like we are trying to

686
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,399
uh co-create Solutions so how do you

687
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,039
approach

688
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,360
that next time I'm going to give you a

689
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:02,880
list of a dozen what I called my micro

690
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:06,880
skills of facilitative leadership one is

691
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,760
how do you convince someone to take

692
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,120
responsibility for helping to solve up

693
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,279
the problem that they think you're the

694
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,760
part of you can either do that or you

695
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:22,080
can it's not about how sweetly you talk

696
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:25,679
it's not about being smarter than the

697
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:30,120
there's a set of principles for how you

698
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:33,559
get someone who's opposed to you to

699
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,240
agree to help solve the problem with you

700
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:40,480
what does it take to develop Your

701
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Capacity to facilitate to turn around a

702
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:49,559
conflict situation to set an agenda for

703
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,919
a group that's Has No Agenda to set

704
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,799
ground rules to how people in a rockus

705
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,679
meeting are dealing with each other the

706
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:03,720
final session I really want to ask you

707
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:07,080
to assess your sense of yourself Your

708
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,039
Capacity to become or to be a

709
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:13,440
facilitative leader or to say I don't

710
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:15,760
see it that's not my role I don't see

711
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,880
myself in that capacity I really want to

712
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,440
get you to take the micro skills to take

713
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,039
the things that we talked about last

714
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,440
time and this time and say do I see

715
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,960
myself functioning in this kind of

716
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,679
situation if you were in the

717
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,320
like the superintendent with lots of

718
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,480
people mad at you partly because of the

719
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,399
symbolic positions you have partly

720
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,559
because of the things you've said and

721
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:44,120
done partly because they just believe

722
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,559
different things from

723
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:51,000
you can you see yourself going to

724
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:54,000
work or not can you deal with

725
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,120
conflict my sense is if you don't have a

726
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,360
pathway in your mind for transforming

727
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,320
those conflict situations into more

728
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,559
workable forms of

729
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,480
collaboration then you you're not going

730
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:13,679
to be able to keep it up it's too hard

731
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,919
you need to Envision some path you need

732
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:20,240
to imagine that you have a half a dozen

733
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,120
micro skills that it takes to work

734
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,080
effectively in that situation so we will

735
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,720
come to that before we stop I want to

736
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,200
come to the the the gender and race

737
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,480
questions that people raised last time

738
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,720
in the case you were just looking at

739
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,840
were you imagining the

740
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,480
superintendent male

741
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,399
female One race another race does it

742
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:51,559
matter to your analysis of the situation

743
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:52,480
how should we see how do we see gender

744
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,080
and

745
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,720
race

746
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,039
intersecting with questions of

747
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,320
leadership now that we've talking about

748
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:05,679
facilitative leadership uh in the public

749
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,280
Arena I mean if you question yourself do

750
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,240
you imagine you were seeing things in a

751
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,480
certain way because you were presuming

752
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,520
the superintendent was male or female

753
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,720
and because it was female you imagined

754
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,000
there were certain options open to her

755
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:27,359
male no we constantly say we should

756
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,839
consider gender and race and a variety

757
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,399
of other other attributes as independent

758
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,000
variables are they in fact relevant

759
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,520
variables in any of the conversations

760
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,320
that we've had

761
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,440
I have personally witnessed women of

762
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,040
color and positions of power and I think

763
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,800
if they were in this hypothetical

764
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,919
situation they would be forced to resign

765
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,639
or there would be this almost like Witch

766
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,760
Hunt happening and I think I mean I'm

767
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,160
coming from a field of architecture but

768
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,160
I've seen it happen with leadersh ship

769
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,119
within that realm faculty or like deans

770
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,200
of colleges in that same realm and it

771
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,119
happens very often so I think I mean

772
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,160
like in my mind I was just imagining a

773
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,520
male in this situation I didn't imagine

774
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,800
like a race but I think that when

775
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,560
it's specifically I'll only speak to

776
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,320
like a person of color um I I think the

777
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,480
repercussions and the processes there

778
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,359
are a lot different often

779
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,000
times because of the expectations of the

780
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,359
community around them or because of

781
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,079
their own sense of themselves I think

782
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:36,000
it's because the

783
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,720
expectations are

784
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,640
higher from the community around them

785
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,119
and

786
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,800
then even if they're meeting the same

787
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,560
kind of threshold as potentially like a

788
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,160
a a white male um the expectations are

789
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,359
so much higher of them that it's almost

790
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,640
impossible for them to succeed in that

791
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,319
capacity

792
00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:00,200
because there's it's just someone's only

793
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:03,960
human so can you think of a pathway or a

794
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,960
set of steps that would make that

795
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,640
diagnosis less likely to be the case I

796
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,240
have a question where is these scenarios

797
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,800
are located in the US and where exactly

798
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,800
because I mean we keep referring about

799
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,920
those cases in the previous session and

800
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:24,359
in this session is are they Global

801
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,119
because the MS like the values the the

802
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:27,880
are completely different from country to

803
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,599
Country and within a country are

804
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,839
completely different from region to

805
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,839
region or from Urban to

806
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,000
rural uh you mentioned in your case

807
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:41,000
before in the first scenario that's why

808
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,400
you ask that questions why you choose a

809
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,800
CEO of a

810
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,560
company that perhaps here in the US with

811
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,040
you know the values in certain parts of

812
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,200
this country the values of a a

813
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:58,119
competition or the values Trace from a

814
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,680
meritocratic system or capital

815
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,920
system makes that that person is a

816
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,160
person that eventually could be admired

817
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,520
by the society and perhaps the mayor we

818
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,800
don't know the hidden agenda of the

819
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,839
major choose that person to represent

820
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,560
that committee but in other parts of the

821
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:18,040
world people do not have that values of

822
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,000
whether is a a razor company or computer

823
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,800
company or hiding people or lead people

824
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,079
because leadership is about completely

825
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
different value that making money or

826
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,640
having a big Corporation I'm not saying

827
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,359
that those are the values here in the US

828
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:36,280
please don't take me wrong but

829
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,760
I or take me wrong but but the question

830
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm saying is very important that we

831
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,640
have a very specific context where this

832
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,920
scenario happen in order to respond

833
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,240
those questions and if be aware as well

834
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,079
that we have to understand the scenario

835
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,280
before we take a decision because one

836
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,079
decision in one country could be

837
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,240
completely the opposite in another one

838
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,920
if you understand the scenario perfectly

839
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,040
are you empowered

840
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,640
differently I I'm accepting the premise

841
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,720
you would be more informed in what ways

842
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,640
are you empowered by being more informed

843
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,760
what does it make you more um optimistic

844
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,960
about the moves you're making and that

845
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,200
likely to likely increase your

846
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,040
Effectiveness from a deontological

847
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,680
perspective I think that I will be more

848
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,160
legitimate to provide advice your

849
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,800
legitimacy because of the mov you an

850
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,440
advisor I'm talking about

851
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:37,480
yeah I'm I'm trying to convince

852
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:40,800
myself that there's a way to talk about

853
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,440
race and gender in the context of

854
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,280
leadership that has nothing to do with

855
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:51,720
personality and that has something to do

856
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:54,839
with being able to use the same skills

857
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:58,800
of facilitative leadership that another

858
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:02,400
facilitative leader has in a

859
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,160
situation because there's either a match

860
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,160
or a mismatch I don't know which between

861
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,640
the race and gender of the person who

862
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,560
wants to act as a leader and the

863
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,079
constituency or the context in which

864
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,680
they're working either that or it

865
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,240
doesn't matter I'm too old to believe it

866
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,560
doesn't matter I've lived through too

867
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,400
many things where race and gender have

868
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,920
mattered to think that there could be a

869
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,880
way that they don't matter so now I'm

870
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,560
trying to figure out well how do they

871
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:39,440
matter and how can instruction build on

872
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:43,240
what it takes given that they matter but

873
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:47,560
I I don't see it yet clearly what

874
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,960
instruction differently not differently

875
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,440
to females that want to take on a

876
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,520
facilitative leadership role do they

877
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,000
have to learn different things do they

878
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:04,319
have to learn it with more confidence do

879
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,520
they have to learn how they're seen they

880
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,160
learn the same thing but they learn how

881
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:12,200
what they've learned is seen by others

882
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,920
and so they can make adjustments before

883
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,720
it's even necessary because of how

884
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,920
others are viewing them not teaching

885
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,599
anything different I'm not assuming that

886
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,880
anything different will play out in

887
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,359
terms of the logic of

888
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,160
leadership but I I believe this makes

889
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,839
some difference in terms of the

890
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,640
perceptions you talked

891
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:41,079
about um women of color in positions of

892
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,880
responsibility who expect they're going

893
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,040
to be judged more

894
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,440
harshly than a a a a white male

895
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:54,040
counterpart would be in the exact same

896
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:59,440
situation and if I assume that's true

897
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:02,400
therefore what can we do to help bolster

898
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,680
the person maybe I can't do anything

899
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,960
about bolstering the person maybe it's

900
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,160
the context and if I have no power to

901
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:15,839
change the context doing something

902
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:18,200
different for with the person won't add

903
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,119
up to a different outcome I don't know

904
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,800
which I believe it is think about the

905
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:28,440
questions that came up about the

906
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,720
scenarios I will focus on micro skills

907
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,920
that I think an effective facilitative

908
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,800
leader has to have I will enumerate them

909
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,800
I will probably use a screen and talk

910
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,440
about what those skills are and when I

911
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:49,359
think they come into play and how uh you

912
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,400
can learn them perfect them develop them

913
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,040
that's going to be the focus next time I

914
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,560
want to talk about those micro skills of

915
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,400
facilitating and empowering and turning

916
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,160
a conflict situation into a joint

917
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,079
problem solving situation and shifting

918
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,640
people from positions to interests which

919
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,200
I think is as I said essential as a step

920
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:17,230
in the process of trying to be effective

921
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:36,929
as a leader I'll see you again next week

922
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:36,929
