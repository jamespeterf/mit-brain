1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,679
hello can people hear me are we good in

2
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:17,480
the

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,920
back are we good can can people hear me

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,400
good good good okay so today we are

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,800
going to uh move on from counting and

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,439
start the last unit on

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,000
probability uh probability is uh you

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
know very important it's one of the most

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
important disciplines you know not just

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,280
in computer science but like in in all

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,879
of the Sciences uh please don't tell

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,480
your other you know science instructors

13
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,719
that I said this um you know you use it

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,879
in like we've already seen it uh in this

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,640
class uh with the Miller Ren algorithm

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,120
uh you also see it in like you know

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,320
other randomized algorithms that you'll

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,800
see later in 61210 1220 5220 if you take

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,960
that uh we see it in Game Theory

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,079
information Theory signal processing

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,440
cryptography uh machine learning

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,879
medicine Stu

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,600
forensics uh you know the list goes on

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,720
and on uh but unfortunately it's also

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,680
one of the least understood

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,680
disciplines uh so there's a a pretty

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,880
famous quote attributed to uh Mark Twain

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Benjamin Dy you know several other

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,520
people uh there are three kinds of lies

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,680
right there are lies there are damned

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,680
lies and

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,200
statistics uh so like you know you can

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,640
kind of lie with probability and

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,280
statistics by you know saying things

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,439
that are true that are you know also

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,840
very

37
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,240
misleading uh common sense is often very

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,439
demonstrably you know completely

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,720
unreliable uh which you know we'll see

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,159
in a in a moment uh there are many

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,280
graduate students like even in our

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,799
department uh again don't tell people

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,360
they said this uh you know that they can

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,399
they can do all sorts of exciting maths

45
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,759
but you know you give them a basic

46
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,920
probability question and you know they

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,640
don't know where to

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,119
start uh there are many garbage papers

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
that are you know based on faulty

50
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:03,320
understanding of probability uh even

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,640
some of our colleagues um have some uh

52
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,759
let's say issues

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,000
um today we are going to look at uh an

54
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,200
example um who who is sort of the Monty

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,599
Hall

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:20,000
problem oh nice decent number of people

57
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,319
okay um so yeah well we'll basically try

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,440
and use the Monty Hall problem to

59
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,080
illustrate that you know it's it's

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,360
really best to just kind of throw away

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,319
your intuition and just fall back on

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,920
rigorous step-by-step analyses okay

63
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,560
so uh the the Monty Hall problem uh it

64
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,840
kind of became famous in 1990 when uh

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,040
this this magazine columnist named uh

66
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,920
Marilyn vos Sant uh received a letter

67
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,599
from a Craig

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,800
Whitaker uh which read as follows

69
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,519
suppose you're on a game show and you're

70
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,440
given the choice of three doors behind

71
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,920
one door is a car and behind the others

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,760
goats you pick a door say number one and

73
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,200
the host who knows what's behind the

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,280
doors opens a different door say number

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,040
three which has a goat he says to do you

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,040
want to pick door number two now the

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,319
question is is it to your advantage to

78
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,280
switch okay and uh who thinks who thinks

79
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,760
yes it is advantageous to

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,799
switch who thinks no who thinks you're

81
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,799
better off sticking with your original

82
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,000
choice who thinks it doesn't

83
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,080
matter okay so it looks like most people

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,720
think that it's advantageous to switch

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,159
uh we've had a few extensions uh I'm

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
going to I'm going to count those as it

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,239
doesn't

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,239
matter uh so Marilyn replied that it's

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,080
indeed advantageous to switch uh if the

90
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,840
car is behind the originally picked door

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,360
then you lose by switching but if it's

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,599
not which is twice as likely then you

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,000
win by

94
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,280
switching uh and you know of course she

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,360
soon received a torrent of hate mail uh

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,879
including from professional

97
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,720
mathematicians

98
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,280
adamantly asserting that she was wrong

99
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,680
okay uh so the the hypo that was

100
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,599
described in this letter became known as

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,319
the Monty Hall problem uh you know after

102
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,760
the the host Monty Hall of the game show

103
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,400
which you know had games like

104
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,160
this uh where where you know contestants

105
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,720
faced very similar

106
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
situations uh so today we're going to

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
analyze it but first can I get uh a

108
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,720
handful of volunteers to come play Let's

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,039
Make a

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,639
Deal okay so empirically at least it

111
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,720
looks like it's better to switch right

112
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,240
like you know most people uh switched

113
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,720
and you know most people won the prize

114
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,759
when they did that uh so you know even

115
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,960
though there's only one door with the

116
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,560
prize it it seems to be pretty promising

117
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,720
right so let's see if we can analyze

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,280
this mathematically okay so we're going

119
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,960
to solve the Monty Hall problem using

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,720
what we call it the the tree method

121
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,600
which is a very simple and Elementary uh

122
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,000
approach uh that doesn't rely on

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,639
intuition it's just going to rely on

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,639
mathematical break

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,520
okay so the tree method uses 4ish steps

126
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,720
uh we used to call it the four step

127
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,240
method but like I couldn't for the life

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,600
of me tell you what the four steps are

129
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,039
if if uh you know they weren't written

130
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,240
in front of me uh so you know I prefer

131
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,319
to call it the tree method uh oh I can't

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,199
even count it kind of has five steps

133
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,199
we've got like a Step

134
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,919
Zero before you even start right you

135
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
really want to make sure that you are

136
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,360
like you know what question you're

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
trying to answer

138
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,639
okay so before we can even think about

139
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,840
uh solving a mathematical problem we we

140
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,440
need to know what the problem is okay uh

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,759
we we we need to to understand the setup

142
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,800
make sure we know what we're trying to

143
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,319
ask uh you know before we can start

144
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,600
analyzing it so the the letter from from

145
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,759
this uh Mr Whitaker was not entirely

146
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,360
precise Okay so we've got to kind of

147
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:10,560
figure out what axium we're working with

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,560
okay so we're going to assume the

149
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,360
following

150
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,360
uh prize is equally

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,319
likely to

152
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,319
be in any

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
box

154
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,639
okay so you know in principle it's

155
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,880
possible that uh you know Monty Hall

156
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,560
tries to be tricky and you know tries to

157
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,639
you know get into the contestants Minds

158
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,639
figure out what box they're going to

159
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,800
pick and like put the price somewhere

160
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,039
else or you know alternatively put the

161
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,000
pricee somewhere where they will pick it

162
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,440
because it's an exciting game show um

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,919
but you know we're going to assume that

164
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,039
you know Monty is just you know picking

165
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,840
the boxes randomly okay so the the prize

166
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,240
is going to go into into a randomly

167
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,080
selected box like completely uniform and

168
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,800
then the other two will have the goats

169
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,160
okay we're also going to assume that

170
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,080
Marilyn

171
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,479
or you know your colleagues whoever is

172
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,479
is doing the picking is equally

173
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,960
likely to

174
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,039
pick any

175
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,240
ebx okay so for the for the first pick

176
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,759
okay uh she doesn't know anything about

177
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,080
what Monty is doing she's just going to

178
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,120
you know toss some random coins in her

179
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,879
head and you know uniformly at random

180
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,039
she'll just pick one of the boxes it

181
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,960
doesn't really matter where the where

182
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,759
the price is

183
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:39,479
okay now after Marilyn picks her her box

184
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,479
right

185
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,000
Monty

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,440
must

187
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,440
reveal a non

188
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,479
prise okay and moreover it cannot be in

189
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,479
Maryland's box

190
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,360
okay so you know all that all that Mr

191
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,240
Whitaker said was right Monty did reveal

192
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,759
a non prize that wasn't uh you know

193
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,720
behind the chosen door uh it's not

194
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,520
entirely clear that this must happen and

195
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,479
in fact I believe on the game show there

196
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,639
were instances where you know he didn't

197
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:27,680
right um so we're just going to assume

198
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,680
that you know Monty is going to reveal a

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,639
prize you know regardless of whether

200
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,440
picked the correct uh correct box to

201
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,440
begin with

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,120
okay and

203
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,120
lastly if Monty has a

204
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
choice he picks

205
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,640
randomly okay so if Marilyn has you know

206
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,959
picked a non-price to begin with right

207
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,839
there's only one other non priz so so

208
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,760
Monty has to reveal that one but if

209
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,640
Marilyn has picked the the prize box to

210
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,440
begin with then Monty could in principle

211
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,640
open either of the other two boxes that

212
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,120
would still follow this role okay so

213
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,360
when Monty has a choice like this we're

214
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,320
going to say that you know he tosses a

215
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,000
coin and he's going to you know open one

216
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,000
of them at random

217
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,640
okay so note that these are all axioms

218
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,640
okay we are just you know taking them on

219
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,440
faith they may or may not have Merit but

220
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,440
if you accept them then you also have to

221
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,040
accept whatever conclusions we draw uh

222
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,560
from them okay uh but you know I should

223
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,839
point out that there are other perfectly

224
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,600
reasonable sets of

225
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,320
axioms uh that would lead us to

226
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,480
different conclusions right like maybe

227
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,760
Monty is you know very rude and if

228
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,880
Marilyn has you know uh has picked the

229
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,079
prize then he offers her the option to

230
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,760
switch

231
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,200
and if Marilyn has not picked the prize

232
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,880
then he forces her to go with whatever

233
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,920
she picked okay you know like this this

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,640
is you know a totally reasonable uh

235
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,480
interpretation uh and that would lead us

236
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,839
to to a different conclusion okay or you

237
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,079
know conversely maybe as benevolent

238
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,959
maybe if Marilyn uh maybe if Marilyn

239
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,920
didn't pick the prize initially he'll

240
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,160
always you know try and encourage her to

241
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
switch uh but if she picked the prize

242
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,519
he'll just be like nope you got to stick

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,519
with that okay

244
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,160
so now that we've got these

245
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,959
axioms we can now pose the mathematical

246
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,959
question uh what is the

247
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:54,959
probability that

248
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,959
Marilyn wins by switching

249
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,720
so uh yes um this is why I I singled you

250
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,560
out I I don't know where where you've

251
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,480
gone um you your colleague who who did

252
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,240
not switch uh you know we're trying to

253
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,000
analyze this probability which is which

254
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,519
is why single you want so I apologize

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,079
for that but you know it's for the

256
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,480
mouths don't take it

257
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,160
personally uh

258
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,760
okay

259
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,760
so now we have you know a well- defined

260
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,639
question right so now we can analyze it

261
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,639
using the four step

262
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,240
method the first of our four steps well

263
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,200
the tree method which has four

264
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,959
steps uh we need to figure out what we

265
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,959
call the sample

266
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,320
space

267
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,680
okay uh so whenever we're thinking about

268
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,040
a probability problem uh underlying it

269
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,959
is always what we call a probability

270
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,680
space okay and a probability space

271
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,680
consists of two

272
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:33,680
things uh these two elements are a set

273
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,680
right which we call the sample

274
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,199
space okay and you know for the purposes

275
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,000
of this class we're we're only going to

276
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:52,839
be looking at discrete probability

277
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,880
spaces so uh s is going to be a

278
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,440
non-empty and countable or finite uh set

279
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,079
we're not going to look at sets like r

280
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,959
or something like that okay so you know

281
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,560
this could be uh you know a set of three

282
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,959
boxes or it could be you know the

283
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,000
natural numbers something like that

284
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,320
something that's you know discret and

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,480
countable uh and then we also have a

286
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
function which we're going to denote by

287
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,680
the letters PR

288
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,880
R which Maps

289
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,760
s into the unit interval 0 to

290
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,120
one

291
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,120
okay so this this is going to be a total

292
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,279
function

293
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,279
with uh probably shouldn't use S here

294
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,279
let's call it

295
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:54,480
X

296
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,920
okay uh and you know slightly oddly when

297
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
we're talking about probabilities we use

298
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,399
square brackets instead of uh

299
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:05,560
parenthesis uh to enclose the argument

300
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,519
um but uh you know this is just a

301
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,560
function you can think of it as like

302
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,560
PR of X

303
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,240
okay uh so we're going to have the

304
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,519
requirement that if you sum up PR of X

305
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,360
over all of the X in your sample space

306
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,680
you should get one okay that's what it

307
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,680
means for this to be a probability

308
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,040
function okay

309
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,519
oh actually why don't we leave both of

310
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,279
these

311
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,279
up and move on to this

312
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,279
board

313
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,279
okay so this is called our probability

314
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:04,279
function and uh elements of s are what

315
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,279
uh we're going to call those outcomes

316
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,680
Okay

317
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,120
Okay so we've got a sample space s which

318
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,399
is a set of outcomes and we've got a

319
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,600
probability function which Maps each

320
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:24,880
outcome to a number between Z and one

321
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,839
okay and it should be the case that all

322
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,720
of those probabilities should sum to

323
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:33,639
one does that make sense to everybody

324
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,079
people people reasonably happy with this

325
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,079
questions comments

326
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,480
concerns

327
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,880
okay so our first objective is going to

328
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,480
be to figure out what our sample space

329
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,480
should be

330
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,959
okay so we're going to do that using

331
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,959
what we call a tree diagram

332
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,279
okay so for the moment we're going to

333
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,440
disregard the probability function and

334
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,959
just focus on S okay and then once we

335
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,720
figured out what s is we can figure out

336
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,959
how to assign probabilities to

337
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,399
everything okay so the tree diagram you

338
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,199
know as you might expect it's going to

339
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,800
be a diagram in the shape of a tree

340
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,519
where each level of the tree represents

341
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,759
some step in the random process we're

342
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,600
trying to model

343
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:37,160
okay so in the case of the Monty Hall

344
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,600
problem what might be the first

345
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,759
step like what's what's the first thing

346
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,959
that happens in the Monty Hall problem

347
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,959
the the first like source of

348
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,959
Randomness

349
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,079
yeah uh okay there's there's something

350
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,880
random that happens even before that the

351
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,880
answer was you pick a door

352
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,800
yeah yeah so the the first random thing

353
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:06,640
that happens right is I or or Monty

354
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,559
picks which store the prize uh the priz

355
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,520
is behind Okay so that's going to be the

356
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,360
first level of our tree

357
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,000
diagram okay so let's start drawing out

358
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,079
our tree diagram we're going to have our

359
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,559
root here and let's label this with you

360
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,559
know Monty hides

361
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,720
price okay

362
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,080
and we're going to have three edges

363
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,080
which go to you know the three

364
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:41,000
possibilities for what happens here okay

365
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,480
so it could be in door a door B actually

366
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,960
why don't I call these you know purple

367
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,960
gold and silver uh where's the

368
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,360
Eraser here we

369
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,799
go Okay so we've got our purple box our

370
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,799
gold box and our Silver Box

371
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,240
okay uh what's the next random thing

372
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
that

373
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,919
happens

374
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,840
yeah yeah yeah so as as your colleague

375
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,600
said last time you know the the next

376
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,120
random thing that happens is Marilyn or

377
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:28,919
you know the contestant picks a door

378
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:31,320
okay so um oh dear Monty and Marlin both

379
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,840
begin with the same letter okay let's

380
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,840
just call this

381
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,400
student okay so now each of

382
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,960
these is going to split into you know

383
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,960
three more possibilities okay so you

384
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,919
know our contestant can pick purple gold

385
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,520
or silver okay for each of these these

386
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,640
three things right regardless of where

387
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,960
Monty has hidden the prize the

388
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,960
contestant can pick you

389
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,200
know any of the uh any of the

390
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,080
doors

391
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,559
okay okay what's the next random thing

392
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,559
that could

393
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,559
happen yeah

394
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,360
were you raising your

395
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,360
hand oh no

396
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,360
no

397
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,240
okay yeah so if Monty has a choice of of

398
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,480
door to reveal then he picks one of the

399
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,640
one of the two remaining doors randomly

400
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,760
okay so so far we've got three branches

401
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,760
where that could happen

402
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,640
right we've got uh you know both Monty

403
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,679
and and uh Marilyn picked door P okay so

404
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,960
in that case Monty can reveal either G

405
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,960
or S

406
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:12,840
okay so let's uh you know make uh make a

407
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,919
branch for that uh similarly if they

408
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,840
both pick

409
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,960
G we could have either P or S and if

410
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,840
they both pick

411
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:27,280
s then here we could have either P or

412
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,080
G

413
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,159
okay now for the remaining ones right

414
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,440
like we we could you know say that uh

415
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,280
there's a random process there where

416
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,000
Monti is you know randomly picking from

417
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,520
a single element set so you know it's

418
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,320
always going to be the same thing we

419
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:49,080
could consider it a random outcome

420
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,080
though so we can also draw these arrows

421
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,559
here

422
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,080
okay uh uh kind of running out of space

423
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,320
here so let's

424
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:11,440
uh put this up

425
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,679
here let's label it on this board

426
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,279
so

427
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,880
Monty

428
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:21,960
reveals a

429
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,240
zon so this is the uh technical term for

430
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,760
a non prize I think the uh the non

431
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,159
prizes on Monty's show were called zonks

432
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,880
uh that they weren't always goats you

433
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,559
know some times it was uh you know

434
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,200
something some other sort of ridiculous

435
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,400
prize like a garbage can or a potato or

436
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,440
something um but yeah they were just

437
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,279
called

438
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,279
songs uh

439
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:51,240
okay so now are we done is there any

440
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,240
other Randomness that we haven't modeled

441
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,080
yet who thinks yes

442
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,000
oh okay so what are we missing

443
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,120
then everybody seems to think we're

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,080
missing somebody or are we just asleep

445
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,840
it is very early in the morning I

446
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,320
understand

447
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,919
uh are we missing

448
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:19,200
anything who thinks we're not missing

449
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,640
anything few hands okay uh well yeah

450
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,880
turns out that this is all of the all of

451
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,600
the randomness um you know you could

452
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,559
think about uh a different problem right

453
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,840
where where Marilyn has a random

454
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:34,279
strategy but for now we're just you know

455
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,200
our question right is you know Marilyn's

456
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,679
always going to switch what's the

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,240
probability that she wins okay so this

458
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,559
is all the randomness that we've

459
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,559
got so

460
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,960
now now that we have our tree structure

461
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,919
we can label our outcomes okay and

462
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,480
that'll tell us what the set s

463
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,960
is so the set s is just going to be the

464
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,080
set of leaves of our

465
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,279
tree okay

466
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,440
each you know path right corresponds to

467
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,480
you know some way that the random

468
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,400
process could turn out right those are

469
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,000
going to be our

470
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,720
outcomes

471
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,200
okay so formally we could label these as

472
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,600
tuples so let's say that this one's

473
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,120
PPG right so that represents you know

474
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,320
Monty hides the prize behind door P

475
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,320
Marilyn picks door p and then Monty

476
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:34,400
reveals a zon behind uh door G okay this

477
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,520
one's going to be

478
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,919
PPS this one's going to be

479
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,039
PG and now I haven't actually labeled

480
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:48,640
The Edge uh but you know if Monty hides

481
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,480
the the prize behind door p and then uh

482
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,520
Marilyn picks door

483
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,520
G where is Monty revealing the

484
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,440
zon s yeah

485
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:08,320
so let's uh label that okay and you know

486
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,320
we can continue all the way down

487
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,000
okay so

488
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,039
s oh I've just realized that I've

489
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,520
overloaded

490
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,559
it it's it's a script DES in my notes

491
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,520
and so it looks different I'm I'm I'm

492
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:27,159
sorry uh okay so our squiggly s is going

493
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,039
to be the set of all

494
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,919
tuples uh

495
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,679
so x y

496
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,039
z

497
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,279
in uh

498
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:42,960
PG s uh

499
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:47,240
oops cubed right so it's going to be

500
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:53,799
triples of you know PG and S such

501
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:56,679
that uh Z is not equal to X and Zed is

502
00:24:53,799 --> 00:25:00,320
not equal to

503
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,320
Y okay

504
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,760
so that's how we're you know

505
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,640
mathematically going to represent our

506
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:11,600
sample space okay so X is the door that

507
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,279
that Monty hides the the prize behind Y

508
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,640
is the door that Marilyn initially

509
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,360
chooses and then Z is going to be the

510
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,880
the door that Monty reveals which has a

511
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,600
goat and by our rule that door cannot be

512
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,440
either of the first

513
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,440
two okay but anything else is a valid

514
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,440
outcome

515
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,919
okay do we have any questions about the

516
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,919
sample space and and how we computed

517
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,399
it okay so our next

518
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,240
step now that we've got our sample space

519
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,240
we want to figure out our probability

520
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,240
function

521
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,000
okay so we'd like to figure out what the

522
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,080
probability of each of these outcomes

523
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,600
is okay so to do this we're going to

524
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,360
assign a probability to every Edge that

525
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,760
we've got in our tree

526
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,360
diagram okay uh and so that's that's

527
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,559
just going to be the probability that

528
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,320
you know if we get to the source of that

529
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,600
edge you know what's the probability

530
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,039
that we uh you know proceed along that

531
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:41,600
edge okay so at the very beginning right

532
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,600
if we're at the

533
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,799
root what's the probability that you

534
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:51,640
know given that we're at the start Monty

535
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,640
hides the uh the prize behind door uh

536
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,640
P yeah one3

537
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,200
yeah so we're going to label this with

538
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,039
one3

539
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,679
okay what about G what's the probability

540
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,919
that Monty hides the uh prize behind

541
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,919
door

542
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
G

543
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,240
anybody okay I mean yeah arithmetic is

544
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,279
pretty difficult but uh I I'll just do

545
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,919
it for you it's also 1/3

546
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,039
okay and uh the probability that Monty

547
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,840
hide sit behind door s

548
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,840
also a third okay yeah

549
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,200
question yeah that's a great observation

550
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,399
so all of these three

551
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,919
probabilities should add up to one right

552
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:48,760
because if we're at this this uh vertex

553
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:52,399
here we should proceed somewhere

554
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,600
right uh so like you know it it wouldn't

555
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,760
make a whole lot of sense to have like

556
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,399
you know probability 1/3 probability 2/3

557
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,519
and probability one right because then

558
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,880
you're like like you have to proceed

559
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,880
down this path but then you also have to

560
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,039
proceed down one of the others like it's

561
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,799
it's a bit sticky okay so given that

562
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,919
you're at this this vertex you've got to

563
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,960
reach a leaf somehow you you've got to

564
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,440
get to some outcome so you've got to

565
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:20,760
proceed okay so you know all of these

566
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,960
edges should uh should sum up to

567
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,200
one great

568
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,720
observation uh it's not quite true

569
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,600
though that that holds for the entire

570
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,760
column

571
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,880
okay so what happens if we look at the

572
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,519
next

573
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,880
column so given that Monty hides the

574
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:40,360
prize behind door P what's the

575
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,360
probability that Marilyn then picks

576
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:49,360
DP any

577
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,120
ideas yeah one3

578
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,399
yeah so Marilyn picks this with

579
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,279
probability 1/3 right like Marilyn

580
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,279
doesn't know or care what's going on

581
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,519
with where the prize actually is

582
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,360
she's just picking each door with

583
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,519
probability 1/3 you know regardless Okay

584
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,159
so we've kind of got the same thing

585
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,600
going on

586
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,000
here each of these three edges has

587
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,679
probability

588
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,240
1/3 but now the same holds true for this

589
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,679
Branch right if Monty has hidden the

590
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,519
door or hidden the prize behind door G

591
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,519
you know the same logic applies right

592
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,480
Marilyn's still picking each door with

593
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,799
probability

594
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,039
1/3 Okay so we've also got 1/3 here 1/3

595
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,399
here 1/3 here okay so it's not quite

596
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,519
that all of the uh edges in a column add

597
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,360
up to one but all of the edges coming

598
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:43,279
out of a single vertex add up to one

599
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,279
okay and same thing for this bottom

600
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:52,360
Branch

601
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,360
okay now what about the last

602
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,360
column if Monty has hidden the prize

603
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,679
behind door p and Marilyn has also

604
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,720
picked door p

605
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,320
what's the probability that we get to

606
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,320
outcome

607
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,120
PPG

608
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,120
yeah one half that's

609
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,559
right

610
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,919
okay and it's also half whoops that's

611
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,640
not a two that's a three there we go 1

612
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,360
half okay so probability one half for

613
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,679
each of them okay we've got probability

614
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,000
one/ half that uh that the zon behind G

615
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,720
is revealed probability one half that

616
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,200
the zon behind s is revealed

617
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,279
okay and as we were saying before uh if

618
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,760
Monty hides the prize behind p and

619
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:39,279
Marilyn picks G Monty now has no choice

620
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,360
okay

621
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,440
so we're just going to say that this is

622
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,440
probability

623
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,000
one okay and same with this one this one

624
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
also has one uh

625
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,039
PSG

626
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,480
okay and similarly for the other three

627
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:59,919
branches so we've got one 1/2 1/2 one

628
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,919
one one 1/2

629
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
and2

630
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,919
okay so did these Edge probabilities

631
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,919
make sense to

632
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,840
everybody okay so now remember what the

633
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:35,600
probability function was right right uh

634
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:39,279
we have to assign a probability to every

635
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,679
outcome okay the outcomes right are the

636
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,159
leaves of our tree not the

637
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:49,279
edges okay so what is the

638
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:53,080
probability that we end up with outcome

639
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,080
PPG for instance

640
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,200
yeah 1 18th and how are you getting

641
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,880
that yeah 1/3 * 1/3 *

642
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,399
1/3 okay we're going to multiply

643
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,399
together all of the

644
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,679
probabilities along the path from the

645
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,440
route to that to that

646
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,519
leaf okay so Monty hides the prize

647
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,720
behind door p with probability

648
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,399
1/3 and then you know conditioned on

649
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,159
that happening

650
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,279
Marilyn then picks door p with

651
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,600
probability 1/3 so then there's

652
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,240
probability 1 nth that we make it to

653
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,039
this vertex

654
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:44,080
here and now that one ninth is split

655
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:46,279
again among these two outcomes okay does

656
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,720
that make sense to

657
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:52,760
everybody so if we do that for every

658
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,519
outcome we've got uh oops 1/ 18th not

659
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,840
1/8 another 1/ 18th for

660
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,840
PPS then what about pgs

661
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,919
yeah yeah it's just one

662
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,760
nth

663
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,240
okay so same deal for the first two

664
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,639
layers but then in the last layer we've

665
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,159
just got a probability of one we don't

666
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:16,600
have to split again so it's it remains

667
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,399
at 1

668
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,639
nth

669
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:24,960
okay and you know once again we can

670
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:29,760
continue we've got uh 1 nth here 11

671
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,760
18th 11 18th 1 n

672
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,639
and we can

673
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,840
continue

674
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,480
okay so we're going to justify this more

675
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,080
formally later but uh you know for now

676
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,639
just take it on faith that in order to

677
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,799
get the uh probability of an outcome uh

678
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:52,159
you multiply together the probabilities

679
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,840
along the path to that outcome okay like

680
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,480
hopefully it at least makes intuitive

681
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,720
sense uh but you know we'll we'll reason

682
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,720
about it more formally later

683
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,480
okay so

684
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,280
now we have our sample space we have our

685
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,800
probability function so we've got the

686
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,679
entire probability space that we're that

687
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:23,800
we're trying to reason about

688
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,800
okay uh the next thing that we want

689
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,240
we want to figure out what what we call

690
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,240
events we care

691
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,240
about

692
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:49,440
okay so an event is simply a

693
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,440
subset of our sample

694
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:01,920
space okay

695
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:01,920
so it's it's a set of

696
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,839
outcomes

697
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:10,720
[Music]

698
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:13,760
so up here right we could think about

699
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,480
the event that Marilyn

700
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:22,400
wins

701
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:22,400
okay so what is that formally as a set

702
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:47,280
yeah yeah exactly so the answer was it's

703
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,280
the subset of events where X and Y are

704
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,319
different so the notation that we

705
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,880
usually use for events is is the

706
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:01,200
following

707
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,000
okay we you know put the description of

708
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
the event in square

709
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:11,240
brackets so this is just going to be the

710
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,240
set right

711
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,440
pgs

712
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,440
PS

713
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,520
g g

714
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
PS

715
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,560
GSP uh s

716
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:37,119
GP s

717
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,119
PG

718
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,400
okay so the six outcomes right where uh

719
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Marilyn and Monty originally pick

720
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,839
different doors and then Monty is forced

721
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,839
to reveal the uh the last

722
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,920
one

723
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:58,359
okay similarly we could also Define you

724
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,000
know other events like uh you know

725
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:01,000
uh Monty

726
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,400
opens uh door

727
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,079
P

728
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:16,160
okay so this is going to be the

729
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:20,440
Set uh g g

730
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,800
p uh s s

731
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,760
p

732
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,520
uh

733
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,520
GSP and

734
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,640
SGP

735
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,200
okay so does this make sense to

736
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,520
everybody like any subset of

737
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,839
events uh or sorry any subset of

738
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,400
outcomes is called an

739
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,440
event uh we can kind of take our English

740
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,280
description and then look at which

741
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:53,280
actual outcomes uh this corresponds

742
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,280
to

743
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,680
okay so what we want to do now

744
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:06,800
is figure out what event we care about

745
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:10,400
or possibly what events okay so what are

746
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,400
the events that we care about for this

747
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,079
problem anybody

748
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,720
what was the probability that we're

749
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,720
trying to compute

750
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,280
yeah

751
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,640
pardon yeah so that the events Marilyn

752
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,319
wins and Marilyn loses right these are

753
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,359
the events we care about okay so uh you

754
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,880
know we could

755
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,880
say Marilyn

756
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,720
loses is you

757
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,960
know the compx

758
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,079
of Maryland WIS which we denote with an

759
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,720
over

760
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:09,520
bar

761
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,520
okay so these are the two events we care

762
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,800
about

763
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,480
okay so the final step

764
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,440
is to compute the answer okay we've

765
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,880
identified the event that we care

766
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,000
about okay so now we want to figure out

767
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,000
the probability that that event

768
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,839
occurs okay so we can extend the

769
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,839
probability function to

770
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,839
events so if e is an event right we can

771
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,079
think about the probability of an event

772
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,480
just as we think about the probability

773
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,560
of

774
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,119
outcomes and we're going to Define this

775
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,359
to

776
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,359
be the

777
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:16,079
sum over all outcomes Omega and

778
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,079
E of the probability of

779
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,079
Omega

780
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,040
okay so you know hopefully intuitively

781
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,960
that makes sense right like all of these

782
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,520
outcomes uh you know exactly one outcome

783
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,440
is is going to happen so if we're trying

784
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,160
to figure out the probability that you

785
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,560
know one of a set of outcomes happens

786
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,079
it's just going to be you know the the

787
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,800
sum of the probabilities that that each

788
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:46,359
individual one

789
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,040
occurs okay so we know the probabilities

790
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:49,800
of each of the outcomes right that's

791
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,800
what we just

792
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
computed

793
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,760
here so now we can use that to compute

794
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,480
the probability of the events we just

795
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,400
uh we just talked

796
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,760
about

797
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,160
okay so what is the probability that

798
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,160
Marilyn

799
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:28,920
wins so we have our set of outcomes

800
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,920
here what's the probability of each one

801
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,599
oh what's what's the probability of

802
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,280
outcome

803
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,079
pgs yeah one n yeah that one's written

804
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,079
up up there

805
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,240
explicitly uh what about the probability

806
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,240
of PSV

807
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,240
same 1

808
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:12,839
nth okay what about the probability of

809
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,880
GPS also a nth right like you know all

810
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:16,880
of these are

811
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,880
symmetric

812
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,000
okay what's that

813
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,040
2/3 okay

814
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,280
so we've got six events or six outcomes

815
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,559
Each of which occurs with probability 1

816
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,119
nth so if you add those all together you

817
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:39,839
get

818
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,920
2/3 okay so this seems to support you

819
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,559
know what we found

820
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,040
empirically right Marilyn wins with

821
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,920
better than probability

822
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:52,079
1/2 right the probability that she loses

823
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,079
is going to be the complement of this

824
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,680
okay so it's going to be the uh sum of

825
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,040
the probabilities of all of the other

826
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,079
outcomes right and we said that all

827
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,520
probabilities uh should add to one so

828
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:13,040
this is going to be you know the

829
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,800
complement with respect to

830
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,200
one okay so as it turns out Marilyn was

831
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,240
correct okay we didn't have to rely on

832
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,280
Intuition or anything like that no

833
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,640
ingenious analogies Etc it's just you

834
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,280
know arithmetic over Q okay and I think

835
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,800
the the hardest part of this for many

836
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,760
people is resisting the temptation to

837
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,559
jump jump to some sort of like obvious

838
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,760
conclusion right like you know it might

839
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,480
be tempting to you know get to the end

840
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,319
of the tree diagram and be like oh we've

841
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,559
got six outcomes where Marilyn wins six

842
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:49,000
where she loses so probably you know 6

843
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:50,920
over 12 is2 right so if we actually you

844
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,359
know set all of that you know intuition

845
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,880
aside go through everything formally

846
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,359
it's all you know quite simple and

847
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,720
straightforward

848
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,720
okay so that makes sense to

849
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,920
everybody okay so let's move on to a

850
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,880
different

851
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,040
example

852
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,839
suppose I have three strange dice okay

853
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,680
so excuse my

854
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:26,079
drawing whoops nothing

855
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:28,119
there okay so I've got one die that has

856
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,640
two written on two of the faces so you

857
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:34,200
know top and bottom uh six written on

858
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,720
you know these two faces and seven

859
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:41,280
written on those two faces okay

860
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:44,000
hopefully that you know looks vaguely

861
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,200
cubical okay I've got a second ey which

862
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,200
is

863
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:53,000
similar uh but instead of 2 six and

864
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:56,520
seven I've got 1 5 and nine then I've

865
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,520
got a third one

866
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,720
which has three four and

867
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:08,400
eight

868
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:13,640
okay so consider the following game

869
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:15,240
okay uh I pick a die right now you pick

870
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,880
one of the uh other

871
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:23,400
dies after or dice after seeing what I

872
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,760
pick and we each roll our dice okay and

873
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,839
whoever gets the higher number

874
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,680
wins okay

875
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,760
who should win should I win or should

876
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,280
you

877
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,280
win who thinks I

878
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,720
win okay who thinks you

879
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,119
win who thinks we should just uh you

880
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,160
know do the tree diagram and figure it

881
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,960
out yeah good call okay so let's let's

882
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:58,040
call these dice like

883
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,559
r g and B okay

884
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,359
so yeah let's let's draw out our tree

885
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:06,559
diagram

886
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:11,200
okay so what happens if say I pick the

887
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:14,760
red D and uh you pick the green

888
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,559
Dy okay who should win let's let's

889
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:20,960
see so we've

890
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:24,280
got when I roll my die right there are

891
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:28,920
three possibilities I could either get a

892
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,920
two a six or a seven

893
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,680
and now you roll the green D and you

894
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:39,160
could have either a one a five or a

895
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:43,119
nine not minus 5 five

896
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,839
1 5 9

897
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,839
1

898
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:47,839
five

899
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:53,400
9

900
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,400
okay and now what is the probability or

901
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,440
sorry what what are the uh what are the

902
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,079
outcomes

903
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,079
we have nine leaves so nine

904
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,079
outcomes how are we going to represent

905
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,760
them well we can do it basically the

906
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,680
same as how we uh represented them up

907
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:27,319
here right we can uh just look at a

908
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:32,520
tupal of uh Edge labels okay so our some

909
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:32,520
space is going to be the Set uh

910
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:44,040
267 uh cartisian product with uh

911
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,960
159 okay so this is going to be ordered

912
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,200
pairs where the first element is one of

913
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,200
these three things and the second is one

914
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:54,040
of these three things okay so this one

915
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:57,960
for instance is 2 comma 1 this one is 2A

916
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,960
5 Etc

917
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,160
okay now what are the probabilities on

918
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,160
each

919
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,440
Edge yeah 1

920
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:18,079
nth uh so those are the uh probabilities

921
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:21,079
on the outcomes yeah one3 on each

922
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,079
Edge

923
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,880
right okay so when I roll my die I've

924
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,240
got a one3 chance each of getting two

925
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,599
six or seven when you roll yours you've

926
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:35,160
got a 1/3 chance each of getting five or

927
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,000
n

928
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,200
okay and you know it's going to be the

929
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,400
same for the other two

930
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,559
branches so when we multiply together

931
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:48,720
the probabilities uh along paths to

932
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:51,559
leaves we get 1 nth for every

933
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,079
outcome

934
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:57,559
okay so when you have a probability

935
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,040
space like this that's particularly nice

936
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,319
this is what we call a uniform

937
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,160
probability

938
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:05,920
space

939
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:10,119
uh so let's

940
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:14,240
say s comma p r so this is our

941
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:14,240
probability space is

942
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:21,400
uniform if uh PR is

943
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,599
constant okay so in this this case it's

944
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,200
a constant function that Maps every

945
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:33,760
outcome to a probability of 1 nth okay

946
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:38,359
so it's a uniform probability

947
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,960
space okay and uh uniform spaces are

948
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:40,920
particularly nice because you know we

949
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,839
don't even have to worry about the

950
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,799
addition that we were doing before like

951
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,559
in order to figure out probabilities of

952
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:49,000
uh of events you just count up how many

953
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:51,119
outcomes are in the event and then

954
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,040
divide by the total number of

955
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:57,480
outcomes okay so it just becomes a

956
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,480
counting problem

957
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,480
so using that what's the probability

958
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,480
that red

959
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:17,000
wins

960
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,000
yeah 5 9ths

961
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,000
yeah so let's break this down a bit so

962
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,640
we're looking at the probability of the

963
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,359
set

964
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:40,920
right 2 comma 1 red wins 6165 red wins

965
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:43,559
and 7175 red wins

966
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:47,240
okay so

967
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,240
21 uh

968
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,160
61

969
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,640
65

970
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:58,040
71

971
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,880
75 we have five of

972
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:04,799
these so

973
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,799
that's 5 over 9

974
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:25,400
okay now what if instead we had red

975
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:25,400
versus blue instead of red versus green

976
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,280
so if instead of red versus green we

977
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:41,440
have red versus blue this column now

978
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,440
gets replaced with 348 instead of

979
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,760
159

980
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,640
okay so our tree diagram is going to

981
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,880
look like the

982
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:58,839
following so we've still got uh 267

983
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,839
here but this time this is going to be 3

984
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:03,359
48

985
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:09,760
348 3

986
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,920
48

987
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,400
okay and I'm going to omit the

988
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,960
probabilities because we just

989
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,359
established it's uniform so it's just a

990
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,359
counting

991
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,400
problem but let's write down the

992
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,400
outcomes

993
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,119
okay so in how many of these outcomes

994
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,119
does red

995
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:56,599
win well not this one right not this one

996
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:00,520
not this one okay so if red rolls two

997
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:02,160
right all of Blue's uh all of Blue's uh

998
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:06,280
numbers are going to be higher so blue

999
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:09,119
is always going to win uh if red rolls

1000
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:13,079
six uh red wins if blue Rolls three or

1001
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,520
four loses if uh blue Rolls eight and

1002
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:15,520
same for

1003
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:23,440
seven

1004
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:23,440
okay so we have

1005
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:30,160
uh four outcomes where red wins so red

1006
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,160
wins with probability four

1007
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:36,640
nths

1008
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:41,400
okay

1009
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,400
so we just saw that uh red beats

1010
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,319
Green but loses to

1011
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:49,440
Blue what does that tell us about blue

1012
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:49,440
and

1013
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,280
green if I pick blue and you pick Green

1014
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:54,280
what

1015
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,440
happens who wins

1016
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,079
yeah Green

1017
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:13,559
why okay so green Beats red

1018
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,680
uh so I think we just established that

1019
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,680
red beats screen

1020
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,599
right so here we've got you know red

1021
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:31,079
beat screen

1022
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:31,079
here we've got red loses to

1023
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,680
Blue so if we

1024
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,839
have uh green and blue who thinks that

1025
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:44,319
green should

1026
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:46,799
win who thinks that blue should win who

1027
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,720
has absolutely no idea who wants to do

1028
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,200
the tree

1029
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,240
diagram oh still pretty enthusiastic

1030
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,799
about that even though we've got some

1031
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,640
intuition that's

1032
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:58,640
great intuition is bad dis SC the

1033
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,200
intuition okay so if we've got green

1034
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,160
versus

1035
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:11,359
blue so this can be the uh green roll

1036
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:17,240
here we've got uh

1037
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,240
159 blue roll can be uh 3

1038
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:20,799
48 3

1039
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,760
48 3

1040
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:29,920
48 okay

1041
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,880
uh so in which of these does green win

1042
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,960
well if green rolls one then you know

1043
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,839
Green is screwed so all of these are bad

1044
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,359
for

1045
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:41,880
green uh if green rolls

1046
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:44,880
five well five will beat three and four

1047
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:48,640
but not eight

1048
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,640
so green wins these two and if green

1049
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:54,240
rolles nine then green Beats you know

1050
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,240
whatever blue rolls

1051
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,280
okay okay

1052
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,640
so it looks like green is winning in

1053
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,640
five of

1054
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,280
these

1055
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:19,799
okay so this should

1056
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,799
be like

1057
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:28,160
that

1058
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,200
okay so red beats green green Beats blue

1059
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,640
and blue Beats

1060
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,640
red what's gone

1061
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,920
wrong

1062
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,880
yeah

1063
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,480
pardon yeah so nothing's gone wrong all

1064
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,960
that's gone wrong is uh you know I I

1065
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,599
kind of expected that there would be a

1066
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,160
linear order on them right right like uh

1067
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,160
you know if red beats green and green

1068
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,799
Beats blue it kind of intuitively makes

1069
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:08,319
sense that red should beat blue right

1070
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:11,160
no no no intuition just do the tree

1071
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:13,799
diagram uh so yeah this is perfectly

1072
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:16,799
fine right and in fact it gets even

1073
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:19,440
weirder right

1074
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:21,960
uh what do you think happens if uh we

1075
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,280
each choose two dice or sorry we each

1076
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,280
roll twice

1077
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:33,359
so what if uh you know what if I pick

1078
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:35,000
the red dy I roll it twice you pick the

1079
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:38,720
green Dy you roll it

1080
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,520
twice right red probably beats Green so

1081
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,200
is it true that two red rolls probably

1082
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,200
beat two green rolls like if we sum them

1083
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,240
up who thinks

1084
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,720
yes who thinks

1085
00:57:52,240 --> 00:58:00,559
no who wants to draw the tree

1086
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,559
diagram oh wow so eager I don't

1087
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,920
um like uh what is the tree diagram

1088
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:08,400
going to look like if we if we do

1089
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,960
that like I'm rolling twice you're

1090
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,760
rolling twice each roll can have you

1091
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,920
know three possible uh uh three

1092
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,280
possibilities right so we're going to

1093
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,520
end up with a pretty massive

1094
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,680
tree I I don't want to draw that at

1095
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,640
least not on the

1096
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,240
board does somebody else want to come up

1097
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:31,720
and do it

1098
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:33,839
please no nobody okay well instead of

1099
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,720
drawing out the entire tree diagram

1100
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,319
let's kind of start drawing it and see

1101
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,319
if we can find a

1102
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:51,079
pattern okay so this is uh R2 versus

1103
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,079
G2

1104
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,720
okay

1105
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:56,559
[Music]

1106
00:58:53,720 --> 00:59:00,760
so let's start by

1107
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:05,119
know drawing as we did before okay so my

1108
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:10,000
first roll as was red could be 2 six or

1109
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,000
7 second rle could also be 2 six or

1110
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,920
7

1111
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,920
okay now for

1112
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,920
green right

1113
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,280
we're basically just going to be drawing

1114
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,200
the same tree nine times so you know

1115
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,839
let's

1116
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,839
not so green could roll you know

1117
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,559
159 and then can also roll

1118
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,559
159 for the second

1119
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,559
roll

1120
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,680
okay and rather than duplicating this

1121
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:58,920
three nine times I'm just going to leave

1122
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,200
this as it is and you know we can see if

1123
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,319
we can find a

1124
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:07,079
pattern

1125
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:07,079
okay does that make sense to

1126
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:18,880
everybody so an outcome now is going to

1127
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,240
be a four tupal right instead of a

1128
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:26,799
pair and in some sense we can kind of

1129
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:30,039
think of it as combining a leaf of this

1130
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:31,599
tree with a leaf of this tree okay we're

1131
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:34,039
going to take a red leaf and a green

1132
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,520
leaf a question or

1133
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:37,520
no no

1134
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,860
okay

1135
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,440
okay

1136
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,280
[Music]

1137
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:50,400
so we can then abbreviate it even

1138
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,119
further right instead of looking at the

1139
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,680
pair of numbers that we've that we've

1140
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,599
rolled let's instead look at you know

1141
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:01,319
just the SU

1142
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:05,680
okay so if red rolls two tws we've got

1143
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:08,520
four here 2 and six is eight 2 and 7 is

1144
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:13,000
N9 uh 6 2 is

1145
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:18,440
8 uh 66 is not 9 that's 12 ever trust me

1146
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:22,119
to do arithmetic uh 67 is 13 72 is 9 76

1147
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,119
is 13 77 is

1148
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,000
14

1149
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:34,480
okay and if we do do the same thing for

1150
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:39,520
uh green we have 2 6 10 6 10

1151
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,520
14 10 14

1152
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:49,160
18

1153
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:51,880
okay so now we can start counting

1154
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:53,960
outcomes if we take this Leaf of the red

1155
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,960
tree how many outcomes are there where

1156
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,480
red wins

1157
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:02,720
if red rolls four in total the only way

1158
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:06,599
that red wins is if green gets Snake

1159
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,599
Eyes Okay so we've just got

1160
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,400
one if red rules eight which could be

1161
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,839
either of these

1162
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,119
two how many outcomes are there where

1163
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:20,039
red

1164
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:25,400
wins well we've got a two here a six

1165
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:25,400
here and a six here so we've got three

1166
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:31,440
and we've got uh two red leaves that

1167
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,559
have eight uh what about nine it looks

1168
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,599
like we've got two more that have

1169
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:39,799
nine same deal right we don't have any

1170
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:39,799
eights or nines over on this

1171
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:46,720
side

1172
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:48,240
okay uh what else do we have

1173
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,880
12

1174
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:55,000
okay well if red rolls 12 then red is

1175
01:02:51,880 --> 01:03:00,760
good if blue Rolls 2 6 10 but not 14 or

1176
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,760
18 so we've got 1 2 3 4 five six

1177
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:06,480
outcomes and we have one red leaf where

1178
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,880
red has

1179
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:15,880
12 okay then same thing for 13 there are

1180
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,880
no 12 or 13s over here and we have two

1181
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,200
13s now what about

1182
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:27,279
14 well if red rolls 14 then you know

1183
01:03:26,279 --> 01:03:31,599
same

1184
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:31,599
deal but we've got these two ties

1185
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,480
here okay so red

1186
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:47,839
winds draw we've just got two and then

1187
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,839
red loses is going to be the complement

1188
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:05,000
okay so has anybody added all of these

1189
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,000
up yet I

1190
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:13,599
haven't 5

1191
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,599
30 42 43 is that

1192
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:27,160
right

1193
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:30,160
so 43 outcomes for red

1194
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,160
wins

1195
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,640
uh had something wrong this doesn't

1196
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,160
match my

1197
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,039
notes

1198
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:52,200
uh let's

1199
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:55,799
see so we've got one for this sub tree

1200
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:57,240
for each of these we have three

1201
01:04:55,799 --> 01:05:01,680
for each of the

1202
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:04,960
nines we also have three so that's those

1203
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,960
12 13 and

1204
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:11,559
13 oh do I just have too many terms I

1205
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,559
just have too many

1206
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:16,559
terms okay not 43 it should be

1207
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:23,039
37 is that

1208
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:26,039
right yeah are 12 13 13 and 14 each have

1209
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,039
six

1210
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:33,039
okay okay uh yeah never trust me to do

1211
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,279
arithmetic it's always a bad plan uh

1212
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:39,000
okay so red wins in 37 of the outcomes

1213
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:42,000
right there's a draw in two of them and

1214
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
how many outcomes are there in

1215
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:54,400
total

1216
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:56,279
yeah1 yeah 81 so red loses in 81 - 37 -

1217
01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:01,480
2

1218
01:05:56,279 --> 01:06:01,480
which is that 42 I think that's

1219
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,520
42 okay

1220
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:11,960
so because this is uniform space we have

1221
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:14,480
37 over 81 42 over

1222
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,400
81 which is going to be well actually

1223
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,440
let's not reduce it it's easier to see

1224
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,640
like

1225
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:26,160
that and two out of 81 for a

1226
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:27,839
draw okay so if we only had one role

1227
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,559
red had the advantage right red wins

1228
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:33,279
with probability 5 9ths if we have two

1229
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,960
roles right the probability that red

1230
01:06:33,279 --> 01:06:37,799
wins is smaller than the probability

1231
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,160
that red loses so now suddenly green has

1232
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:41,119
the advantage

1233
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:46,599
instead

1234
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:48,839
okay and um as it turns out you know the

1235
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:53,599
same thing happens with all three pairs

1236
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:56,039
of dice right so uh you know red beats

1237
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,520
Green with with one roll green Beats

1238
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:59,720
blue with one roll but Blue Beats Green

1239
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,559
with two

1240
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:06,760
rolls right and Blue Beats red with with

1241
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:09,720
one roll but red beats blue with two

1242
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,520
rolls and

1243
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:14,319
uh yeah so the the the dice continue to

1244
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,480
you know not have this transitivity

1245
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:22,359
property but like every time it's

1246
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:25,359
switched okay and as it turns out uh you

1247
01:07:22,359 --> 01:07:28,000
know you can even you know extend this

1248
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:30,359
right right like if you have more dice

1249
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,880
with different numbers you can get like

1250
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:35,880
all sorts of weird things that are that

1251
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:38,520
are that that could happen um so there's

1252
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,160
a a link to a to a a rather interesting

1253
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:45,400
paper on archive if you if you want to

1254
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:46,640
see it uh in the lecture notes um but uh

1255
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,480
yeah for now I think that's all we have

1256
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,960
time for feel free to uh come up if you

1257
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,240
have questions and otherwise we will see

1258
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,240
you on Thursday
