00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Hi everyone. Uh my name is Molly Breen

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,320
and I am the CEO and co-founder of

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,559
Parig. Uh our MIT connection is my

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,039
co-founder uh who went to MIT. I

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,720
unfortunately went to Harvard. Uh and I

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,359
am here to introduce Parig which is a

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,039
new AI native digital fabric. And the

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
big problem that we solve is that

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
enterprises are all running on software.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
But that software doesn't work well for

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,439
those businesses out of the box.

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,360
everything from the salesforce like the

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840
CRM system, the accounting system

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,600
tracking finance all the way to the ERP.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
Uh there's always gaps in how these

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,960
things are connecting uh and the

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,559
business and the processes that they're

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
trying to run and it's the team that

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,160
ends up having to be the glue between

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,480
all of these different systems and

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,640
they're manually entering information

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,480
into these systems. They're exporting

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
information and putting it into Excel or

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,879
creating PowerPoints uh or they're like

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,359
pivoting between these different

26
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,520
systems. It's really expensive. uh it

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,520
doesn't work well, nobody likes it, uh

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,840
and you still don't have the answers for

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
how your business is doing. So, PARG is

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
solving this uh and we're that glue for

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,200
all of the data sources within an

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
enterprise and the workflows that

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
they're trying to run. And it's really

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
simple. It's a software that essentially

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,640
is integrating across all of these

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,320
siloed systems. We're automating manual

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,200
work and then we're amplifying them

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,880
using AI. And it actually works. teams

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
say that we are 100 times faster to

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,280
implement, 100 times easier to use and

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
100 times more adaptable as the business

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
changes.

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,680
So as this AI native digital fabric,

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,520
it's a software platform where picture a

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
business process within your company and

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
all of the IT systems that are related

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,600
but also like the nonIT systems, the

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,159
CSVs, the questionnaires and then using

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,200
a combination of this tool set use um

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,280
including interfaces, automations, even

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,360
um data storage and this AI co-pilot

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
that helps you write them teams ranging

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
from IT and sales all the way to

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,159
leadership are automating these manual

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,560
work. So just a few examples of this uh

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
teams take a crawl walk run approach. So

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,479
some really simple things would be

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,319
moving information from system A to

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,319
system B. So when a shipment is created

60
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,319
in the shipping system in the warehouse

61
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,120
uh and a record is automatically created

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,440
in the in the Salesforce for example. Uh

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,040
or if you're uh you know have a team

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
that's just like exporting data into

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,000
Excel every single week to build a

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,920
report like that's something that you

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
can automate with paraget. in this

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,760
walking uh category. Picture places

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,160
where you're trying to unify multiple

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,160
tools into a single dashboard or even

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,239
places where maybe you've overspent on a

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
solution and you're paying more uh too

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,720
much for it. You can uh bring that into

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
paragy. That happens a lot with like ERP

75
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
systems where uh people often overspend.

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
Uh and then finally, every business is

77
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,720
unique. uh and there's usually some

78
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
combination of these existing processes

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
that are true to their competitive

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
advantage and those teams in this run

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
approach are building those types of

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,000
software solutions to fill those unique

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,360
needs on top of

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,080
parig a really good example of this is

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,480
par is working with IGPS which is like a

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,959
midsize logistics company uh they're

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,200
doing reusable pallets between uh the

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
Chobanis of the world and the Walmarts

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,599
and within the logistics industry it is

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,239
plagued by a ton of legacy processes one

91
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,840
of which is this paperbased process that

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
uh confirms whether a shipment is

93
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
delivered or not. Somebody has to like

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
submit this PDF to say it was delivered.

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
Uh and this is a huge problem for them

96
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,400
because uh all the time these papers are

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,800
lost or there's some type of error in it

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
and all of those errors lead to lost

99
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,760
pallets and lost pallets obviously lead

100
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,840
to lost revenue. So using parig they

101
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,080
essentially trained an AI model on all

102
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,760
of their forms uh and they insert and

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,159
then we integrated with their existing

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,080
logistic system and we sit in line where

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,760
this AI model is essentially detecting

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
when a new form is submitted if it's

107
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,480
valid or not. Suspicious forms are

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,239
flagged uh uh and then a user can come

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,239
in and review it and with one click they

110
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,080
can ask a customer to resubmit it. And

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,200
this has transformed this process where

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
we're saving them 80 hours a month. uh

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,959
we've improved their cash flow by two

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,120
days and we've also improved their

115
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,879
customer experience because there's so

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,720
much less back and forth. Nobody's

117
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,560
getting mischarged and they're having

118
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,200
this true competitive advantage through

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
AI powered

120
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,840
transformation. And so we invite you to

121
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,519
consider what are the manual work or

122
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
siloed systems that you're looking to

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,160
fix within your company and uh check out

124
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
the more than 25 enterprises that are

125
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
using Parig uh with our companies

126
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,720
ranging from IGPS but also PepsiCo and

127
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,840
Burger King and more. uh we typically

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,960
work with IT leaders at mid to large

129
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,040
organizations uh predominantly in

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,880
retail, manufacturing, logistics and

131
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,280
would love to share more uh after the

132
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,280
talk. Thank you. Thank you Molly.
