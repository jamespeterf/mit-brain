1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:03,478
(air whooshing)

2
00:00:03,478 --> 00:00:05,310
(intriguing orchestral music)

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,930
- So the main research challenge

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,480
that we were trying to
address with Thermochromorph

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,900
is how do we create multicolored images

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,330
that transition into each other?

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,310
How do we add more expressivity

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,870
to these color changing effects

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,950
beyond just single color to
single color transitions?

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,940
We're creating this multicolor
CMYK printmaking process

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,533
with thermochromic inks.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,500
The printmaking process that we're using

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,910
is called relief printing,

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,610
and it's this really
traditional form of printmaking

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,670
that existed hundreds of years ago.

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,120
The main reason why we wanted
to focus on relief printing

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,970
was because we wanted to minimize
the material requirements

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,320
and set-up times.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,120
Instead of using regular inks,

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,150
we use fully thermochromic inks.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,320
There are thermochromic inks

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,980
that go from clear to color at
some activation temperature,

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,960
and inks that go from color to clear

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,270
at the same activation temperature.

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,700
So by taking advantage of those materials

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,260
with special properties

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,200
and using both color to
clear and clear to color,

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,480
CMYK thermochromic inks,

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,520
we're able to create these images

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,950
that shift into each other.

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,290
And it can be used for a
number of application areas

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,170
from artistic to more
functional use cases.

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,300
So, for example, maybe
you have a stove-top

34
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,070
with these prints on top of it

35
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,170
that communicates when the top is too hot.

36
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,190
What we've explored so far
are small-scale applications

37
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,890
on the order of just handheld prints,

38
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,990
but I think that we can apply this process

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,680
to say large-scale
installations or signage,

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,220
but you can imagine a billboard
that changes the appearance,

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,930
depending on the time of day.

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,600
And because the sun is
this natural heat source,

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,330
you don't even have to use
special electronics or anything

44
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,280
to see the visual change.

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,140
I'm really excited to see a world

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,350
where we can have more
interactive materials and objects

47
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,600
that can visually respond dynamically

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,460
to properties like human touch.

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,600
And by providing this
printmaking process for people,

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,270
we can empower everyday users

51
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,003
to create objects with those properties.
