Hello I’m Youyeon Choi,

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,307
I'm a 3rd year PhD student

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:11,077
in the Department of Nuclear Science
and Engineering here at MIT.

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:16,316
My research focuses on advanced
modeling and simulation of nuclear fuel

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,853
for water cooled, small modular reactor applications.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,823
Fuel is the core of the reactor
core designs

7
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:27,027
and what you use
for the fuel really matters

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,696
for the economics of the nuclear reactor.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,633
So I think really using the advanced
modeling and simulation for the

10
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,669
nuclear fuel is a key
in designing a nuclear reactor.

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,873
All the reactors which are operating these days

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,342
are all using standard cylinder fuel,

13
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:47,080
which is ceramic fuel
using uranium dioxide as a fuel material.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,383
But the fuel that I'm working on
has a different concept.

15
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,218
It is helical cruciform fuel.

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,655
So it has a cruciform shape
and a twisted surface.

17
00:00:55,655 --> 00:01:00,527
So in that way, we can have a high power
density in these small modular reactors.

18
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,097
We can improve the economics
of small modular reactors.

19
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,334
So there are a lot of things that I like
for being at MIT.

20
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:12,872
First thing is there are a lot of
brilliant people who are really passionate

21
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,274
about what they're doing,

22
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,409
so I'm really motivated by them.

23
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,480
This is very exciting time
for all the nuclear engineers and students.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,084
There are a lot of interest
and investments for the reactor designs

25
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,720
but I think there are still
some challenges that need to be overcome.

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,158
For all small modular reactors
it has a lack of economies of scale

27
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:36,963
and we need to improve the economic
competitiveness of small modular reactors.

28
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:42,135
So I think this fuel will help
to be more economical in the future.
