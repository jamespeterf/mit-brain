1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
thank you for the introduction and thank

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,399
you for the opportunity to share some of

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,160
our work with you here so the actual

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,240
title is a little longer than what's in

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,400
the program that's because for analog

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,439
energy efficient Hardware I'm going to

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,920
share with you our electrochemical

8
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:22,119
devices as a biop plausible Hardware

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,519
platform that can enable energy

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,439
efficient brain inspired

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,119
Computing so this is what I'm going to

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,160
share with you is a collaborative effort

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,840
between myself my group as well as my

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,040
colleagues asella Lama and Julie on

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
materials and devices as well as with

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,640
Michael fee in connection to

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,160
Neuroscience in the longer term and of

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,760
course the results that I will share

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,600
with you are the product of the work of

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,719
our current and past group members PhD

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,280
students and postdocs who have been

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,359
working with us that we are very

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:02,920
grateful to so as the theme of this

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:08,280
session AI we are for a number of years

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:12,400
aware of the exploding energy need of AI

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,640
training and and use contexts and it's

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,119
growing very fast and the data that was

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,079
shown to you earlier by Tomas that shows

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,479
projection of compute energy by 2045

30
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,159
thanks to AI is supposed to consume all

31
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:27,400
over world's electricity production

32
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,360
which is of course not sustainable and

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,320
the CO2 emissions associated with that

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
energy cons consumption using the

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,920
current grid is of course a big concern

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,159
and we have been aware of this for a

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,640
number of years so as you have heard in

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,600
the introduction I'm also with the

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
nuclear science and engineering

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,719
department and until this year I would

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,119
joke at the beginning of my talks that

42
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,240
you need a small modular nuclear reactor

43
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,960
to go with each data center or to train

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,880
major machine learning models but it's

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,039
no longer joke so as of last month

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,840
especially these big tech companies

47
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,560
Amazon Microsoft Google have been racing

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,840
with each other in buying and investing

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
in nuclear like Microsoft bought a

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,760
recently closed nuclear reactor to

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
reopen it just to power their data

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,720
centers Google and Amazon have been

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,239
investing in new nuclear reactor

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,800
technologies that they're trying to push

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,360
as fast as possible just to power their

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,920
data center so this is um huge issue

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
extremely fast growing energy demand of

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,680
data centers and Ai and of course one

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,959
way to reduce the CO2 emission pain is

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,040
to buy nuclear in the near term but

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,360
there are of course bigger efforts in

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,480
the field both from hardware and

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,720
software perspectives to reduce the

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,920
energy consumption of

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,720
computing and one approach that we are

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,519
involved with in includes physical

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,879
neural networks that combine processing

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,080
and memory in one unit in order to

69
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,760
reduce energy consumption associated

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,519
with data shuttling in our current

71
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,799
Computing architectures and in such

72
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,159
Hardware physical neural networks the

73
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,319
connectivity of the array is to emulate

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,200
the connectivity of the neurons but the

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,239
cross points are essential and they are

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,080
supposed to be trained and represent

77
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,080
node weights in a physical neural

78
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,959
network and at the same time emulate

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,360
some functionality of the synapses both

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,439
for near-term and long-term application

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
so there

82
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,680
conductance should be programmable by

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,680
voltage pulses that we apply by voltage

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,319
history that we apply at these cross

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,080
points and at least for the hardware

86
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,439
deep neural network applications there

87
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,640
are some industry targets that we should

88
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,640
keep in mind which of course includes

89
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,200
very fast programmability on the order

90
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,040
of nanosecond time scales programming

91
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,560
with low voltage order of one volt

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,319
storage capacity up to 100 or 100 States

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,680
conductance change change order of

94
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,599
tenfold and a constraint on the high

95
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,000
resistance that should not be lower than

96
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,239
about 110 Mega ohm variation should be

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,840
low enough so that the network can be

98
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,560
trained reliably and the target there is

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,400
less than 30% and of course it has to be

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,199
low energy with a target of less than

101
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,880
ftoj per programmed state so those are

102
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,720
numbers we can keep in mind for the

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,720
nearer term Hardware DNN application and

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,440
I can tell you from the beginning that

105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,080
no current device technology at those

106
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,000
synaptic connections at present address

107
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,680
all of these targets simultaneously so

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,600
we are working in with those Targets in

109
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,560
mind okay and before I show you what we

110
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,039
are working on let's look briefly at a

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,479
higher level at the biological synapse

112
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,840
where we know the synaptic connection

113
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,919
strength so the signal transmission is

114
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,160
depends on the electrical history at

115
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,919
each synapse

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,120
we can obtain long-term increase or

117
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,280
decrease of that synaptic connection

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,960
that's referred to as potentiation or

119
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,919
depression so that's simple conductance

120
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,919
change but there are also very

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,639
interesting dynamics that that takes

122
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,039
place in the biological synapse where

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,479
the extent and sign of this conductance

124
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,680
change can depend on the relative timing

125
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,400
of signals that come to the synapse from

126
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,800
the Press synaptic or the post synaptic

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,560
neuron that's referred to for example as

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,759
Spike timing dependent

129
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,120
plasticity and to do this changing

130
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,520
conductance and also Dynamics the

131
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,600
biological synapse has small cations

132
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,520
that it transmits through the synaptic

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,199
connection under voltage difference so

134
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,440
you can see this as a chemical or

135
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,360
electrochemical cell that transmits

136
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,960
small cat like sodium pottassium calcium

137
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,880
that then triggers certain chemical

138
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,680
reactions to change the conductance of

139
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,120
the synapse so small cat involved but in

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
liquid medium and organic material of

141
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,840
course so the question for us has been

142
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,919
can we be inspired from these ionic

143
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,800
processes to emulate these synaptic

144
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,919
functions or potentiation and dynamic

145
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,599
changes in the potentiation but using

146
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,440
inorganic materials that we can make

147
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,639
devices out of and the ions that we can

148
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,759
work with can of course include the

149
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,400
biological ions but also others like

150
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,880
smaller ones for example proton or

151
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,360
lithium and we do so the type of devices

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,599
that we work with do use these type of

153
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,639
ions and we refer to them as

154
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:47,000
electrochemical ionic synapses or

155
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,000
electrochemical Ram whose goal is to

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,160
serve as the synaptic devices in those

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,759
physical neural networks in a low energy

158
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,560
and as biop plausible manner as possible

159
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,800
and these devices are nothing but

160
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
miniaturized batter batteries in fact

161
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,400
the thermodynamic and kinetic working

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,160
principles are the same as batteries but

163
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,240
we want these to be low energy and low

164
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
capacity unlike the batteries you want

165
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,199
for your mobile devices or for your cars

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
so we have a reservoir where we store

167
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,599
the iron and if this is a metal this can

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,120
also be the Gate of the device that's at

169
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,199
the top shown on the sketch the bottom

170
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,039
is the target material the channel that

171
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,520
we are trying to

172
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,319
tune and separated by an electric

173
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,120
electronically insulating but ionically

174
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,479
conducting electrolyte and as you apply

175
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,440
a positive potential at the gate or the

176
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,199
reservoir you oxidize the stored ion so

177
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,400
in this case we're working with the

178
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,639
smallest ion proton we store it as

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,479
hydrogen and it becomes proton migrates

180
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,479
through the electrolyte under potential

181
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,520
difference and the electrons take the

182
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,919
outer circuit if you have chosen the

183
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,479
channel material appropriately the

184
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,360
electron brought together with the

185
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,080
proton can be done ated into electronic

186
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,840
states of the material and serve as

187
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,560
anend type doping and tune up the

188
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,720
conductivity so for example Tung noide

189
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,879
is um semiconductor that we are working

190
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,800
with with about 2.8 EV band Gap the

191
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,400
electron brought together with proton

192
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,560
gets donated into ingap States

193
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,479
associated with tungsten and form

194
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,440
polaronic carriers and increase

195
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:30,240
electronic conductivity so after such

196
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,440
right if you open the circuit you can

197
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,080
obtain ultimate nonvolatility because

198
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,719
electrons cannot go back and therefore

199
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,959
the ions cannot go back but there are

200
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,880
other more practical ways of getting

201
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,959
nonvolatility from these devices too so

202
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,959
the range of wies we can work with is

203
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,360
Broad but everything I will show you is

204
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,279
with protons because protons are the

205
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,240
smallest ions in solid state which allow

206
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,080
faster diffusivity faster speed and

207
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,440
lower energy in doing

208
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,920
so so the layers that involve the St

209
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
storage of proton in the form of

210
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,519
hydrogen is metal hydrides so we are not

211
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,839
relying on water or some or organic

212
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,320
hydrogen Source but a practical metal

213
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,040
hydde that we can work with padium

214
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,640
hydrite the channel can be a number of

215
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,320
different semiconductors which

216
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,279
intercalate small cations and the

217
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,959
results that I will share with you are

218
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,279
from Tung noide and the electrolytes we

219
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,720
started with our polymeric just to

220
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,839
demonstrate the concept like nepon and

221
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,200
then we move to inorganic materials to

222
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,880
be able to downscale the device

223
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,040
Dimensions such as silica zironia and

224
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,519
havia that I will show to you so the

225
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,720
behavior that I exemplify here is that

226
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,560
the conductance goes up after each

227
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,160
positive voltage pulse that's sent to

228
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,519
the gate and that's because we are

229
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,279
inserting protons and electrons in a

230
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,600
nonvolatile way way into the channel and

231
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,000
we are not limited to only few pulse

232
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,040
pulses you can apply thousands of pulses

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and the example on the right is showing

234
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,959
this potentiation depression Behavior

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,399
with a number of pulses that brings

236
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,880
protons in in going up and takes protons

237
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,000
out as well as the electrons out as we

238
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,360
go down in the depression side of the

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,880
curve so this is the behavior you want

240
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,920
for being able to implement this in the

241
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:28,320
training of Hardware DNS as fast as

242
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,600
possible and while we started with

243
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,240
naphon as the um very fast conducting

244
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,560
protonic electrolyte this is not

245
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,880
conducive to scaling down so it's

246
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,079
interesting that we can run these

247
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,519
protonic devices with other thin film

248
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,519
oxides that function as electrolyte like

249
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,839
silica hnia and

250
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:53,120
zironia and these thin film oxides as

251
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,560
the electrolyte layer actually allow us

252
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,839
to run these devices very fast down to

253
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,800
four five nond programming speed

254
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,800
with very low energy consumption on the

255
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,040
order of 10 or tens of atj per

256
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,880
programmed State just the

257
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,040
electrochemical energy consumption part

258
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,800
and so it's that being extremely low

259
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,040
energy is very

260
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,519
encouraging and what's intriguing that I

261
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,680
will note here is that these oxides like

262
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,399
silica havia zonia they are actually

263
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,639
insulating dial electrics they don't

264
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,639
pass ions or electrons in their bulk if

265
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:31,320
we just rely on their bulk lattice but

266
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,600
we have to make them in low density at

267
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,519
the verge of

268
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,519
nanoporosity so that they can absorb

269
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,440
humidity or absorb water and O groups

270
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,480
that allow to conduct the protons

271
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,920
through this internally percolated path

272
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
so it's like internal surface

273
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,079
conduction so because the mechanism

274
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,440
relies on intercalation of the ions into

275
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,800
the lattice of the channel it's a

276
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,279
uniform non- filamentary

277
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,959
mechanism and unlike the filamentary

278
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,839
resistive switching mechanism in the

279
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,839
field like metal filament formation or

280
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,480
oxygen vacancy filament formation in

281
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,959
dielectrics it's much more repeatable

282
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,320
and therefore more reliable for training

283
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,320
so what I'm showing here is the cycle to

284
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,480
cycle variability of a Tung snide half

285
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,240
pelium hydde device showing 800 Cycles

286
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,399
with very good repeatability and if you

287
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,959
quantify the variability it's about 1%

288
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:38,000
over more than 2 million uh right pulses

289
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,120
across about 800 Cycles spanning the

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,519
right conductance regime so staying in

291
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,240
the low conductance regime which is very

292
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,720
encouraging and the target is actually

293
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,959
30% or less for variability so cycle to

294
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,760
cycle is already well achieving that

295
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:54,680
even with devices that we make in our

296
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,079
labs in in the

297
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,600
University when we compare device to

298
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,560
device variability of course this is

299
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,800
more challeng in but even in that case

300
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,160
when we are looking at channels that

301
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,399
have different micr structures channels

302
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,120
that have different sizes still this set

303
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,760
is above the Micron scale regime the

304
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,079
variability on average is about 10% so

305
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,079
this is standard deviation of the

306
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,079
conductance change over the mean again

307
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,800
staying in the very low conductance

308
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,480
regime this is a very challenging thing

309
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,160
to do in fact and that 10% may look high

310
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,440
just as the number but again for this

311
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,120
this application Hardware DNN the target

312
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,839
is 30% and it was actually not possible

313
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,360
to achieve this with state-of-the-art RM

314
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,680
to date and if you look at the data on

315
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,600
the right that's from literature even

316
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,519
though the conductance regime is much

317
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,480
higher 100 fold higher conductance

318
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,959
regime the variability device to device

319
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,720
is 10 fold or more which is not

320
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,519
acceptable so this ion intercalation

321
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,079
approach giving us a uniform nominally

322
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,920
uniform mechanism to to change is much

323
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,680
more controllable and repeatable that

324
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,240
should improve the reliability of the

325
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,920
training of networks with them so that's

326
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,279
all let's say quantification of certain

327
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,079
specifications for near-term Hardware

328
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,600
applications where we want the

329
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,720
conductance change fast low energy but

330
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,920
we don't care about the Dynamics so if

331
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,959
you think longer term there are

332
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,639
interesting dynamics that take place in

333
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,199
learning rules such as the example I

334
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,959
gave at the beginning Spike timing

335
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,839
dependent plastic City and because we

336
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,920
are also working with ions and charge

337
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,600
transfer reactions which are actually

338
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,040
very nonlinear with voltage can we

339
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,759
emulate some of these nonlinear

340
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,839
processes also in the biological synapse

341
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,560
so for this we constructed a simple

342
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,440
circuit around the electrochemical

343
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,079
device which allows us to overlap the

344
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
pre synaptic and the post synaptic

345
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,839
voltage

346
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,160
pulses and apply app that at the gate

347
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:07,800
and also design the voltage pulse form

348
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,759
so that we can emulate some of these uh

349
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,440
nonlinear uh types of potentiation at

350
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,240
the synapsis so what we are essentially

351
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,279
sending to the gate of the

352
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,079
electrochemical device becomes um linear

353
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,639
superposition of the press synaptic and

354
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:27,000
the post synaptic voltage pulses at the

355
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,959
at the neurons that come to the

356
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,720
synapse and I won't go into details but

357
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,319
again using the simple circuit and

358
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,680
designing the voltage forms

359
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:37,839
appropriately we can emulate different

360
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,319
types of sdp that takes place in

361
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,920
different places of our brain so the

362
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,880
leftmost one is the most commonly

363
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,519
referred Spike timing PL Spike timing

364
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,360
dependent plasticity and that takes

365
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,720
place in a particular uh part of our

366
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,440
brain that's um qualitatively sketched

367
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,360
in the top row but the other three that

368
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,040
come from hippocampus or pyramid

369
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,040
hippocampus or entorhinal parts of our

370
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,880
brain they all show different Dynamic

371
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,759
learning rules at the synapse so they

372
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,720
are all referred to as stdp but the

373
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,480
functional form is different and there

374
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,240
are others also in fact and the key for

375
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,519
us has been to come up with that simple

376
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,920
controll circuit and Leverage The

377
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,880
nonlinearity of our electrochemical

378
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,120
devices and deterministically designed

379
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,279
voltage forms that can give us that can

380
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,319
allow us to emulate these different stdp

381
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:37,759
functions in in our inorganic devices so

382
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,880
these can be then integrated into

383
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,000
spiking neural networks for even more

384
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,120
energy efficient um AI applications

385
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,759
longer term than

386
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,519
DNA and of course the biological process

387
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,000
is in the milliseconds but we can tune

388
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,680
down this stdp response also to the nanc

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,959
time scale both by increasing the

390
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,680
voltage which is really a nonlinear

391
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,920
effect but also by changing the geometry

392
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,720
in particular making the electrolyte

393
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,600
thinner and that can give you a wide

394
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,319
time scale to play with that connects to

395
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,480
neuroscience at the millisecond time

396
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,880
scale but also can get things much

397
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:20,959
faster at the nanc time scale and again

398
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:23,439
if we compare this stdp behavior and its

399
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,160
controllability to other attempts of

400
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,319
stdp in the literature we can see much

401
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,799
lower variability of the data using

402
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,600
these deterministic electrochemical

403
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,080
devices across the whole time scales

404
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,120
that we could program even down to the

405
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,039
nanc regime the variability that we

406
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,240
quantify from this stdp function with

407
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,600
our electrochemical device is much lower

408
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,160
than other attempts with resistive

409
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,559
switching or phase change materials or

410
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,760
ferroelectric tunnel Junctions or fero

411
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,960
electric fats that attempt to do this

412
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,360
but with much less controllability

413
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,159
so controllable stdp functions fast

414
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,320
programmability and low variation better

415
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,760
reliability are all

416
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,640
possible so very briefly even longer

417
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,039
term what else can we do with these

418
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,200
ionic devices so we talked about

419
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,080
Hardware DNN potentially stdp but when

420
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,280
we talk to our Neuroscience colleagues

421
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,240
they of course know much more than us

422
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,720
and we were very motivated to connect to

423
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,480
one of them Michael Fe who has been

424
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,480
working on deducing a learning rule that

425
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,760
describes how baby birds learn to sing

426
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,440
and I won't go into the details but the

427
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,480
mechanism involves three signals and

428
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,760
first is the stored Melody that the baby

429
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,360
bird listens and stores at a certain

430
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,280
part of his brain and the variability

431
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,080
that it generates so vocal exploration

432
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,480
and first as it generates this

433
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,200
variability there must be a context of

434
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,120
the song that is coincidence So Random

435
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,880
variability but there is good match so

436
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,000
that's not enough if there is good match

437
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,520
between the variability and the stored

438
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,960
context of the

439
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,520
song before too late if a third signal

440
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,200
the reward comes in then the

441
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,840
corresponding synapsis that control the

442
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,520
vocal cord for the right Melody can be

443
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,039
strengthened so you need three of these

444
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,080
signals to be coincident at different

445
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,799
time sequences and therefore it's

446
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,280
referred to as three Factor learning

447
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,640
room in particular this first

448
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,440
coincidence between the vocal

449
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,559
variability so vocal exploration and the

450
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,000
stored context of the song is extremely

451
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,760
important and if there is coincidence

452
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,400
then what's produced is something called

453
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,320
eligibility Trace which makes that

454
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,159
coincidence eligible for being

455
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,480
rewarded and it's a nonlinear signal in

456
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,880
time also it increases and decays over

457
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,480
time time and the question for us is is

458
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,280
this possible to also generate by ionic

459
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,000
devices and indeed we can do this so the

460
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,080
devices that I introduced to you can be

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,200
nonvolatile if you open the gate or

462
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,919
float the gate but they can also be

463
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,039
volatile depending on the voltage form

464
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,400
they apply as well as keeping the gate

465
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,799
not

466
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,520
floating and so pretty much we use a

467
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,760
volatile version of the same device to

468
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,799
serve as this and coincidence and delay

469
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,960
weight operator to generate the

470
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:39,520
eligibility Trace that is defined in

471
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,200
neuroscience and very quickly I can

472
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,840
because I'm showing this to you it means

473
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,799
we are actually able to generate this

474
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,159
signal so the eligibility Trace

475
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,720
generation with context and variability

476
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,760
signals being coincident gives us this

477
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,159
lower experimental data which indeed

478
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
looks like the functional form of the

479
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,640
eligibility Trace discussed in

480
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,280
neuroscience and if the two signals that

481
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,799
are not coincident the output of that

482
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,320
volatile device does not give us the

483
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,440
non-zero eligibility tra and if on top

484
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,880
of the generated eligibility tra we have

485
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,960
a third signal the reward that comes in

486
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,320
before the eligibility Trace completely

487
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,480
decays then we can obtain different

488
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,440
extents of strengthening at the ultimate

489
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,320
synapse that's the second

490
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,120
device and even if there is eligibility

491
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,720
even if there is reward but no

492
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,840
eligibility Trace so the context was not

493
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,360
matched then even if you have reward

494
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,880
it's random and the output actually does

495
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,240
not generate strengthening of the

496
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,520
synapse we are very excited about this

497
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,760
because it becomes an all ionic circuit

498
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,679
not only the synapse but also the

499
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:53,120
control circuit around it and it's a

500
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:55,799
very simple um footprint very low energy

501
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,600
in capturing this essential building

502
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,360
block of a biop plausible learning rule

503
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,960
that can be applicable to other

504
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,600
mechanisms as well so with that I will

505
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,279
stop and end by repeating that we are

506
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,480
very excited about these ionic

507
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:12,679
electrochemical devices that are

508
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,760
deterministically controlled in their

509
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,240
electronic modulation mechanism gives us

510
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,760
the ability to do very low energy

511
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,480
processing and very fast down to atle

512
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,279
and nanc regime still there are

513
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,080
challenges that I have not told you

514
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,159
about and I'm happy to discuss during

515
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,640
the break so we have to work on coming

516
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:36,080
up with better materials for these

517
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,720
devices in fact and Beyond um near-term

518
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,000
Hardware DNN context they can also be

519
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,080
enablers of energy efficient Hardware

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,320
building blocks for brain inspired

521
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,520
Hardware such as spiking neural networks

522
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,720
or these biop plausible learning rules

523
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,279
that I have exemplified you from

524
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,400
Neuroscience so with that I will stop

525
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,039
here and hope you have some questions

526
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,440
