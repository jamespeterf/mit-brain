1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
so it's a pleasure to be here and it's a

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,760
pleasure to share a little bit about the

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,840
ideas that our lab is developing to

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,639
interface with the body and the Brain to

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,680
understand the complex interplay of

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,800
signals between our brain and the

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,119
viscera and when we thinking about the

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,599
brain and Mark just had this absolutely

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,720
beautiful introduction of the complexity

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,160
of the brain this is another picture

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,840
taken by my talented colleague Professor

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,800
Casey Chong uh when at the time when he

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,160
was still a pooc and we were in the same

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
lab and there you're looking at

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,399
different colors and those different

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,760
colors represent different types of

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,520
cells each of those cells has a specific

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,199
function and together they play as an

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,399
orchestra to really make us who we are

20
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:50,879
now how do we probe this wonderful

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,480
complexity there is a variety of tools

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,800
that we can use but when we think about

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,879
uh look at them in aggregate everything

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,079
that we can possibly implant into the

25
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,439
biological system came to our field from

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,280
the field from semiconductors and

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,560
electronics now those tools can be

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,400
extremely powerful and useful they can

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,280
have they can be really fast and have

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,439
really high resolution but I'm a

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,920
material Scientist by background and

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:20,079
when I look at them they all to me seem

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,840
to have something in common in terms of

34
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,439
their structure and that is they're hard

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,400
they're brittle and they're sharp and

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,439
they have very little in common with our

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,840
actual tissues so when when we thinking

38
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,439
about the elastic modules of a typical

39
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,240
semiconductor wafer we thinking about

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,920
hundreds of gigap pascals while our

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,240
brain has elastic modulus of a pudding

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,719
or yogurt in the order of kilopascals

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,840
maybe megap pascals now what do you

44
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,880
think is going to happen when we use a

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,920
device with elastic properties of a

46
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,719
knife and implant it into the brain with

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,320
elastic properties of a pudding now also

48
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,000
let's take into account the fact that

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,680
your device most likely be fixed to the

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,640
skull while the brain moves every time

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,320
you take a step every time you take a

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,399
breath or your heart beats so now you

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,800
have a device and your brain is moving

54
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,200
around it so we're starting to damage

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,440
the very tissue that we are trying to

56
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,720
very precisely interface with to extract

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,280
those sophisticated signals that Mark

58
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,319
for instance has been talking about so

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,560
how do we solve this problem in our

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,440
group we draw inspiration from nerves

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,080
when we thinking about a nerve

62
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,680
those can of course go on for kilometers

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,879
or start from micrometers they can

64
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,360
transmit a variety of signals not only

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,920
electrical but of course also chemical

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,159
mechanical and other signals and they

67
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,159
goes they're flexible and stretchable

68
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,000
and they span our entire body so

69
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,400
wouldn't it be great to be able to

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,879
engineer an artificial Nerf and this is

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,640
exactly what our lb is interested in and

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,959
to do this we shamelessly steal and

73
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,560
borrow from photonics and

74
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,480
Telecommunications which is more

75
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,040
commensurate with the field that I came

76
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,560
from in opt

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,720
Electronics so in opt Electronics we are

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,480
all aware with Optical fibers those

79
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,400
carry our signals underneath the oceans

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,560
allow us to call our friends in London

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,879
and Tokyo but those fibers that are

82
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,560
typically based on glass but it turns

83
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,480
out they don't have to be we can make

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
fibers from any material that we want in

85
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,640
fact we can bring many materials

86
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,840
together as long as they have similar

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,920
thermomechanical properties now we can

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,519
imagine a device on a micro scale we can

89
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,680
think for instance that we are

90
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,159
interested in recording neural signals

91
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,560
so we need electrodes we may want to

92
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,360
perform Optical stimulation with a

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,079
method called optogenetics that uh Mark

94
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,840
touched on and which means we need

95
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,760
Optical wave guides we want to be able

96
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,920
to deliver drugs which means we need

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,120
microfuidic

98
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,040
now we can take this imagination to the

99
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,360
machine shop and incorporate all those

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,000
features that we're interested in in a

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,680
macro scale using very simple

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,759
fabrication techniques then we can take

103
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,120
this macro scale model that we call a

104
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,560
preform we heat it and we pull it and

105
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,919
features that started out as inches

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,000
become

107
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,800
microns and we get a Kil kilometers of

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,479
integrated flexible stretchable

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
structure that with all those functional

110
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,680
features how does it actually look and

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,560
feel if you take one of your hairs and

112
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,440
imagine that inside it are electrodes

113
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,759
Optical channels microfluidics variety

114
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,840
of other sensors but the size and uh

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,600
mechanical properties are very similar

116
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,600
to your hair with these types of devices

117
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,120
we can perform many functions for

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,840
instance we can simultaneously stimulate

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,240
neural activity and record it in real

120
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,400
time we can then also combine it with a

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,479
delivery of a drug for instance here

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,000
this pink rectangle is an infusion of

123
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:14,160
inhibitory compound um which then

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,919
reduces the neural activity in this

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,560
particular uh brain region and as the

126
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,880
brain starts to wash out this drug the

127
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,759
activity begins to recover and as it

128
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,560
recovers we can watch it in real time

129
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,080
now this experiments we have been

130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,319
performing them in mice in in context of

131
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,759
various beh behaviors in the context of

132
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,039
fundamental

133
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,240
Neuroscience but what if we wanted to be

134
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,120
able to translate this technology for

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,520
clinical use we have to conf confront a

136
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,759
very simple problem and that is the

137
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,039
problem of size turns out Mouse brains

138
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,639
are about the size of your

139
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,680
thumbnail human brain is the size of

140
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,520
your two fists brought together if you

141
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,080
design a tool that you fully test in a

142
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,919
mouse that tool will be probably on the

143
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,960
order of a few millimeters in dimensions

144
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,160
and have can have high resolution now if

145
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,000
you want to take the same style tool

146
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,800
translated to a human it now needs to be

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,599
about 8 cm for the same

148
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,479
application which means everything about

149
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,280
your design needs to change if it was a

150
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,080
wafer bound

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,720
process however this logic does not

152
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,280
apply to fibers because fibers are drawn

153
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,840
by kilometers

154
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,160
so the same tool that we can test and

155
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,000
rigorously evaluate in the context of

156
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,840
many different Mouse experiments now if

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,759
we want to go into a larger brain we can

158
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,199
simply just cut a longer piece and

159
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,880
maintain all the same functions and this

160
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,919
is exactly what we did and we're for the

161
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,720
first time able to translate fiber based

162
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,280
tools for experiments in non-human

163
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,919
primates where it was very difficult to

164
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,360
achieve simultane recording and chemical

165
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,120
neuromodulation the same way we would do

166
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,960
it in a human patient here we are uh

167
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,680
have a a awake um non-human primate

168
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,240
performing a task uh but what matters

169
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,400
here is that we are recording neural

170
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,960
activity with single neural precision

171
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,440
and then we are going to infuse a drug a

172
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,080
Gaba inhibitory compound and as we

173
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,840
infusing this drug at a low

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,160
concentration low amount you see

175
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,560
temporary inhibition of neural activity

176
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,960
for a short amount of time if we Infuse

177
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,000
more drugs our activity will be

178
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,039
inhibited for longer and of course this

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,639
is a proof of concept experiment

180
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,240
experiment but it shows that we can now

181
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,240
apply this Technologies in translational

182
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,800
models and U uh in a variety of

183
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,840
contexts but what I'd like to talk about

184
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,960
next is our field of Neuroscience in

185
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,479
general it so far we have been focused

186
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,360
on the brain and brain is complex and

187
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,759
we're still trying to figure out how it

188
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,879
works but we are largely been

189
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,680
considering it in

190
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,080
vacuum but more and more we're starting

191
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,080
to learn that brain is intimately

192
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,400
connected to the rest of our body well

193
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,919
if you cut off the head you know what

194
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,879
happens but also that those inputs from

195
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,159
our body may be influencing how our

196
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,280
brain works on a higher level and

197
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,560
there's

198
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,880
a lot of evidence for this for instance

199
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,519
there are now experiments that show is

200
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,560
not only that anxiety makes your heart

201
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:46,360
Pace faster in fact pacing the heart

202
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,200
faster makes one anxious we also now

203
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,200
know that it is possible to treat

204
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,600
arthritis and which is an inflammatory

205
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,320
conditions by tapping into neural

206
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,680
signals of the vagus nerve a large nerve

207
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,600
that con connects your uh um brain stem

208
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,160
to the organs in your body we also

209
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,680
starting to learn that the microbes in

210
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,160
the gii tracts somehow transmit

211
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,240
informations to the brain and that

212
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,279
information can be can change our

213
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,399
behavior for instance make us more or

214
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:24,040
less motivated to exercise so how do we

215
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,839
now record those signals how can we now

216
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,959
begin studying those systems and those

217
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,800
connections in a rigorous way and I'm

218
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:36,320
going to approach this problem starting

219
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,560
from one uh particular circuit and that

220
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,720
is the communication between the gut and

221
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,920
the Brain why those are are interesting

222
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
well there's 100 billion neurons in your

223
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,160
brain but there also happens to be a

224
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,920
billion neurons in your gut what are

225
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,959
they doing that's a good that's a good

226
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,079
question why should we know what they're

227
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,160
doing well it turns out we can link many

228
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,920
condition that we typically think of as

229
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,959
neurological or psychiatric to

230
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,440
dysfunctions of U gii tract and we don't

231
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,440
know whether they're correlative or

232
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,800
causitive but what we do know is eight

233
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,839
out of 10 Parkinson's patients would

234
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,880
receive a constipation diagnosis back in

235
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,720
their medical history by 20 years before

236
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,720
they even know that they have moror

237
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,760
dysfunction nine out of 10 autistic kids

238
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,480
would have severe GI symptoms ranging

239
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:36,399
from food sensitivities to uh cyclic

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,600
vomiting and based on the genome wide

241
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,880
Association studies anxiety and IBS

242
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,399
share genetic risks are those causitive

243
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,480
or correlative we don't know we need to

244
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,160
be able to study these neural

245
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,839
connections and while our tools work

246
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,200
really well in the brain we now are

247
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:58,440
confronted Vis A system that even more

248
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,920
complex from an engineering standpoint

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,680
and that is the gut

250
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,399
unlike the brain that moves a little bit

251
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,800
within our skull and it's surrounded by

252
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,279
the skull the gut moves

253
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,279
microscopically the and continuously and

254
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,240
the nervous system of the gut is

255
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,959
embedded in a thin uh gut wall in a

256
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,920
mouse it's only 300 microns and it's not

257
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:26,560
much thicker in a human if we puncture

258
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,600
gut wall we can uh and cause severe

259
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,920
reaction it can result in sepsis and

260
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,440
deadly at the same time this system is

261
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,480
also full of stuff and that stuff is not

262
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:44,680
nice now how do we design electronics

263
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,760
that can withstand the assault of the GI

264
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,959
tract but at the same time not damage

265
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,200
its delicate walls in our group we have

266
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,800
previously designed fibers that were not

267
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,920
only flexible but also stretchable and

268
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,279
could in principle accommodate gut

269
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,320
movement M and

270
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,639
deformation however they still had a

271
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,240
fiber architecture where most of the

272
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,399
emission happened at the tip all the

273
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,200
functions were confined to the tip here

274
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,040
the clading is stripped so you can see

275
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,240
it in the dark but the gut nervous

276
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,399
system is actually distributed along the

277
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,600
length of the gut which is about four

278
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,760
times longer than the mouse or seven

279
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,600
times longer than a human so how do we

280
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,399
deal with this distributed radial nature

281
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,040
of this organ we had to completely

282
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,680
rethink how we design these um uh these

283
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,760
devices how do we distribute sensors and

284
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,920
we did this by combining mature

285
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:46,160
microelectronics with fiber based

286
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,040
fabrication we can now take microscopic

287
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,160
sensors produced on wafers in standard

288
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,519
fabrication processes incorporate them

289
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,160
into the fibers at the level of the

290
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,199
preform and as we draw our fiber El

291
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,120
elodes that are Incorporated can form

292
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:09,480
contacts with our electronic components

293
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,120
giving us fully functional devices that

294
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,959
can be communicated with within the

295
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,240
fiber here I'm showing you LEDs because

296
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,360
they're really fun to look at but of

297
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,800
course we can do a variety of other

298
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,720
sensors such as photo detectors chemical

299
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,120
sensors and maybe even Computing

300
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,720
components going forward now by having

301
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,639
all our Electronics embedded within the

302
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,279
fibers rather than being interfaced

303
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:37,079
externally means that we can now use

304
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:40,240
wireless tools to communicate with this

305
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,519
devices and untether our experiments and

306
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,480
here in these

307
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,279
simple uh uh demonstrations you can see

308
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,800
LEDs lighting up in gut and brain sides

309
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:53,160
of our device but the same devices also

310
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,839
contain electrodes for neural recording

311
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,079
contain microfluidics for drug delivery

312
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,440
now we have means to interface with the

313
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,639
gut and the Brain and do so wirelessly

314
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,720
what questions should we ask well we're

315
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,560
talking about the gut it's lunchtime we

316
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,880
are all starving so let's talk about

317
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,279
food now the uh and the simple question

318
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:18,240
we are going to ask is preferences for

319
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,199
Taste and if we are thinking about uh

320
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,399
choosing whether we are going to drink

321
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:26,480
real Coke or Diet Coke we you think

322
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,160
we're choosing this completely based on

323
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,279
flavor but we can actually make the

324
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,600
flavors in the lab be very very similar

325
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:39,519
and we can offer Mouse a choice between

326
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,759
real sugar and Splendor and it turns out

327
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,720
mice are not fooled by sweetness and

328
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,680
they learn to prefer the real sugar very

329
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,000
very quickly within seconds and they

330
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,480
will only drink real coke they will

331
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,720
never drink diet so and neither should

332
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,560
you so the um however now we can use our

333
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,440
God

334
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,279
neurotechnology to inhibit the activity

335
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,800
of sensory cells that can chemically

336
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,720
distinguish between sucrose and fake

337
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,079
sugar sucral loes and when we inhibit

338
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,399
those gut cells mice lose their ability

339
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,560
to distinguish between those sugars and

340
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,360
they will drink diet coke just the same

341
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,519
so it's not the taste not only the taste

342
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,199
that decides it but what happens in your

343
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:31,639
gut the gut loves the calories

344
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,399
now how can how about some more

345
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,319
interesting effects can we turn to

346
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,279
something that we typically associate

347
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:42,759
with the brain and uh Mark has mentioned

348
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,800
reward circuits which are the circuits

349
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,160
that control our mood and our happiness

350
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,040
how do you think about happiness in the

351
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,839
mouse well we typically think about it

352
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,560
as release of dopamine our neur

353
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,160
happiness neurotransmitter in the parts

354
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,560
uh in this uh in the midbrain part of

355
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,440
the of the uh central nervous system now

356
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,279
when dopamine gets released it

357
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,759
supposingly makes animals um feel

358
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:11,959
rewarded and uh uh respond to this

359
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,720
behaviorally and this is a very classic

360
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,000
behavioral Paradigm because we cannot

361
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,240
ask mice so we have to perform a

362
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,920
behavioral essay and this essay is very

363
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,600
simple it's a we place mouse in a box

364
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,319
and in this box there are two

365
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,319
compartments and on one side of the Box

366
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,519
we can apply the stimulation and we are

367
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,639
going to stimulate dopamine NE neurons

368
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,600
that will release dopamine and when that

369
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,800
happens mice feel happy in uh or

370
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,120
rewarded in this com uh compartment and

371
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,759
they learn to prefer this area this is a

372
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,480
very robust effect this is a textbook

373
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,440
sort of laboratory experiment and

374
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,800
Neuroscience it's used across many

375
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,519
different stimulation uh

376
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,560
paradigms so now we're going to conduct

377
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,319
a different experiment we are going to

378
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,680
leave the brain alone and we are taking

379
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,920
the same uh Place preference as say but

380
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,160
now we are going to use our gut fiber to

381
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,360
stimulate neur nerve endings at the

382
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,360
level of the durum that actually

383
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,360
lead uh via the vagus nerve to the brain

384
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,720
and ultimately connect to rever circuits

385
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:23,720
and when we do this we get exactly the

386
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:27,360
same effect mice learn to prefer the

387
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,799
stimulation chamber just the same way as

388
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,360
they would have if we stimulated their

389
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,880
brain we're now doing it completely at

390
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,679
the level of their GI tract which gives

391
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,000
implications that it may be possible in

392
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,559
future to treat conditions such as

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,880
depression or post-traumatic stress not

394
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,080
from the level of the brain but from the

395
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,960
level of the periphery which could be

396
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,640
significantly less invasive now the

397
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,520
message that I would like to leave you

398
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,919
with is that every organ in your body is

399
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,120
inovated every organ in your body talks

400
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,880
back to the brain and now we have the

401
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,240
bioelectronic tools to tap into the

402
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,760
power of this brain body Innovation and

403
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,919
start achieving whole human health and I

404
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,400
have to thank my extremely talented

405
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,799
group of students and postdocs and

406
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,280
generous support from Kisa Yang brain

407
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,720
Body Center as well as national uh

408
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,240
Institutes of Health and other agencies

409
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,240
thank you very much

410
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,520
thank you very much Pina for this

411
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,400
interesting presentation to me you just

412
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,600
explained or gave a scientific basis to

413
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
what we commonly refer to as a gut

414
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,600
feeling

415
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
right so any

416
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,120
questions I I don't um thank you so much

417
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,240
was such a fascinating uh presentation I

418
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,840
saw the Splender versus uh suus

419
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,880
experiment and I'm assuming the Splenda

420
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,039
versus equal versus everything is the

421
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,520
same right it can distinguish sugar

422
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:20,000
versus any of those sweeters right so we

423
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,600
have not conducted that precise essay of

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,679
trying to do multiple artificial

425
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,400
sweeteners so sucros is typically used

426
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,240
so as long as it's a sucros based

427
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
artificial sweetener you would get the

428
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,760
same effect effect if it's uh sweetener

429
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,960
based in a different type of sugar then

430
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,559
we have to look at the receptor profile

431
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,240
in those cells and whether those will be

432
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,000
with it so the types of cells that we

433
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,960
are stimulating they're called chosy

434
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,919
ainin uh and Tero Endocrine cells in the

435
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,000
GI tract and um they happen to have

436
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,880
receptors for both the sucrose and

437
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,080
Sucralose and when they send sucrose

438
00:19:51,880 --> 00:20:02,480
they actually um send a neuronal signal

439
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,480
uh mediated um sort of uh uh

440
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,559
through

441
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:14,280
um mark would know the excitatory no

442
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:18,760
it's not a GQ the uh it is an excitatory

443
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:22,240
neuronal transmission sort of normal uh

444
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,120
yeah so and then however if they when

445
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,679
they send

446
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,280
um uh sucralose they send a different

447
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,919
signal which does not trigger sort of

448
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,039
Downstream neuronal

449
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:38,440
activity so but if we are dealing with

450
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,039
other sweeteners we might have to access

451
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,360
different cell types that would have

452
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,360
receptors for those sweeteners

453
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,799
hi thank you U you mentioned that um um

454
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,919
the re uh the change in diet had impact

455
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:14,200
for Parkinson disease um but

456
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:17,559
um do I'm not sure is there um other

457
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,120
neurological conditions like uh um

458
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:23,360
Alzheimer's or

459
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,520
schizophrenia it might be associated

460
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,000
with that

461
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:32,600
too so uh I would like to first um

462
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,600
clarify that it's there is no dietary

463
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,320
link with

464
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:41,840
Parkinson's um so at least no

465
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:45,039
well um well-known link so what the link

466
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,640
that we do know is if we look at a

467
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,559
diagnosed Parkinson's patients who is

468
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,840
symptomatic and then if we'll go back in

469
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:57,600
the medical history by 20 years or some

470
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,440
number of decades we will see that they

471
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,320
had complete ains with their primary

472
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,640
practitioners about their GI function

473
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,640
most commonly constipation what we also

474
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,720
know is that if we take postmortem

475
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,799
tissues from Parkinson's patients they

476
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,400
have Aggregates of a protein called

477
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,440
Alphas nucleon in their gut which also

478
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,840
happens to the be whole Mark of

479
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,799
Parkinson's in the brain

480
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,279
so which together led to this somewhat

481
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,320
controversial hypothesis called bra

482
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:35,960
hypothesis Post in

483
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,440
2003 where uh he posited that

484
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,000
environmental factors might be entering

485
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,480
the body and triggering precipitation of

486
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,880
alpha nucleon in the GI tract which then

487
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,200
takes the neuronal route to propagate

488
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,559
back from the gut through the neuron

489
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,240
neuronal connections into the brain

490
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,720
where then it then triggers

491
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,000
precipitation of this protein in

492
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,520
substantial where dopamine neurons

493
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,919
end up dying and that's the kind of

494
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,120
parkinsonian

495
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:09,200
diagnosis however this hypothesis right

496
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,000
now is merely a hypothesis and this is

497
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,919
something that uh was very difficult to

498
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,919
test now we do have the tools to be able

499
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,080
to test this because we can interface

500
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,000
with gut and brain and we're very

501
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,360
interested in this but we should not

502
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,080
treat it as correct as far as we are

503
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,440
concerned those are

504
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,440
coincidental thank you

505
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,360
okay thank you very much Molina for this

506
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:46,260
super interesting talk

507
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,260
[Applause]
