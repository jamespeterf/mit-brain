1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,000
All right, we'll get started. Um, see,

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
last time we introduced you to the

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,119
definition of martingales.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,880
And what we're going to do the first

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,320
part today is to see how useful and

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,840
powerful martinale properties are in

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,800
solving interesting uh questions and

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,200
challenges. So, so just as a reminder,

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,800
if we have a stochcastic process xn,

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,640
which is just a sequence of random

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,000
variables, generally the uh index n

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,520
corresponds to time. Then we can

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,520
consider another uh a derived process

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,479
capital m subn which is a function of

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,680
the first n values of the stochcastic

16
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,479
process x. And we say that this second

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,880
process, this derived process is a

18
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,400
martingale if the expected value into

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,520
the future from time n minus one is

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,400
simply equal to the time n minus one

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,400
value. So with a process evolving over

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,400
time,

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,479
we have a an m subn process basically at

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,680
time n minus one. We have a value. Our

25
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:49,119
prediction is that the expected value of

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,159
that in the future is mn minus one.

27
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,000
And so some examples of these we went

28
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,759
through last time a simple random walk

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,280
and with the simple random walk we end

30
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,280
up having realizations of this

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,440
martingale

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:14,000
that uh evolve from say a starting point

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:18,239
zero and what's critical with the these

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,160
realizations is that the future paths

35
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:26,160
that have yet to be graphed um will have

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,080
average value equal to the last point on

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,480
these realizations.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,720
So there's a notion of there being

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,400
flatness in the martingale uh

40
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,319
expectations.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Um with the example here of a simple

42
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,879
random walk with equal probability of

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,239
going up or down one step, one can graph

44
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,280
the standard deviations

45
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,120
uh from the average zero for the

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:04,080
processes and um you know basically the

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,400
realizations of the random walk will by

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,000
the central limit theorem

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,040
converge to a normal distribution at any

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,560
given time point far into the future.

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:21,840
Now um this second example of a

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,920
martingale where we have a random walk

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,800
sn but then we square it and subtract n

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,959
times the sigma squared the variance of

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,159
each of the steps. This is also a

56
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,959
martingale. And so looking at different

57
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,519
realizations of this martingale

58
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,959
um we can see it's very very different

59
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,519
from that of a simple random walk. Um

60
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,280
and you know importantly

61
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:54,080
um there's basically sort of a lower

62
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:58,879
limit u of the process it appears for

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:02,159
fixed n and an unbounded upper limit. Um

64
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,159
and uh but this process as well is a

65
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,680
martingale.

66
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,760
Um and let's see a different martinale

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:17,440
can be defined not in terms of random

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:20,720
walks with steps that add but with

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:25,520
random sort of shifts

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:29,440
with factors x1 dxn. So if we have MN

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,720
being the product of X1 to XN where the

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,440
X's are independent random variables

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,520
with mean value one then this particular

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,960
uh process M subn will be a martingale

75
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:51,600
with respect to the original series. So

76
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:57,520
um so here's an example of our Berni

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,199
factors which are with 50% probability

78
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,360
1.5

79
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:08,400
and with 50% probability 0.5.

80
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,919
This would correspond to the change in

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,600
wealth from betting your wealth

82
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:20,160
in a lottery where you either make 50%

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:24,639
or lose 50% with equal probability.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,479
And here is the uh graph of a

85
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,560
realization over 50 steps. Here's other

86
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,160
realizations.

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:39,919
And what's interesting to see is that

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,840
with this particular uh martingale,

89
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,479
there are opportunities to basically if

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,400
you're playing this lottery game at each

91
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:54,000
step to be able to grow your wealth to

92
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:59,280
five or 10 times its value, its initial

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,919
value, but very uh with moderate or even

94
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,800
high probability ility you actually have

95
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,440
lost almost all your wealth. So um yet

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,319
another example and this one is really

97
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:17,360
rather curious to introduce but it shows

98
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,000
you how we can be flexible in uh

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:26,080
generating or constructing uh

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,880
martingales. If we have the YN sequence

101
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:36,319
being IID random variables

102
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:40,960
and the moment generating function

103
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:45,360
E to the lambda YN

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,600
or E to the lambda Y

105
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,759
uh

106
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,680
YN

107
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,560
is equal to the moment a generating

108
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,560
function and or let's say e to the ty is

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,880
in the our notation we're going to use a

110
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,479
fee of lambda here or f of t.

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,960
Um

112
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:12,960
then uh if we consider uh taking

113
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:20,400
xn

114
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:22,880
equaling e to the lambda yn divided by v

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:30,160
of lambda

116
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:33,919
then this xn will be a martingale

117
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,400
uh or this xn rather will the factors

118
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,120
that have expectation

119
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:44,319
equaling one.

120
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:49,440
And if we take the product of these x's

121
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:52,560
um we basically have m subn equaling e

122
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,560
to the lambda times the sum of the y

123
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,560
ends

124
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,120
divided by

125
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,560
f of lambda

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,400
to the nth power. This will also be a

127
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,360
martingale.

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,000
And what we'll see in a you know towards

129
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,720
the uh middle of this lecture is that

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,720
this particular martingale can be used

131
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:22,960
to solve probabilities of gamblers ruin

132
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,160
when you have gambles that have um

133
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,160
different probabilities of uh success

134
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,839
versus failure not necessarily equal uh

135
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,680
fair bets. All right. Well, with

136
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,560
martinales,

137
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
it turns out to be very useful to

138
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,120
consider

139
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,800
this what's we call the information sets

140
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,519
on

141
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,760
the sequence the subsequence of

142
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:58,560
variables x1 through xn. So if we think

143
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:03,120
of information being uh progressing over

144
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,560
time, the information up to time little

145
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,160
n can be given by the outcomes of the x

146
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,680
process.

147
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,519
And we can consider

148
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:20,240
expectations of random variables given

149
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,240
this information set. And the kinds of

150
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,880
random variables we might be interested

151
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,800
in. Z can correspond to say trading

152
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,800
strategies based on the outcomes of

153
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:41,360
asset prices progressing over time.

154
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:44,560
And um we if we have uh let's see if if

155
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,920
this original information set is

156
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,160
represented in terms of a martinale

157
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,680
um then

158
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:02,560
we

159
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:06,399
can consider um functions of the first n

160
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,800
values given by y

161
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,880
and

162
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,320
relating to

163
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,640
this function of the first n values

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,480
which could be say the trading gains

165
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,480
from applying a uh a trading strategy

166
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,240
with asset prices given by the x's.

167
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,240
It will be very useful to use

168
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,959
random variables that are called

169
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,600
nonanticipating.

170
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,440
And so a non-anticipating random

171
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,720
variable

172
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:47,200
is a random variable an end that is

173
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,560
defined by the information set. It's

174
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,160
non-random given the information set uh

175
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:59,680
of the first n minus one x's.

176
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,200
So if we wanted to represent the outcome

177
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
of

178
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,800
making trading decisions using the first

179
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,320
n minus one values

180
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,920
um this a could characterize how we

181
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,800
might invest for the nth uh trading

182
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,680
period. Now

183
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,440
with such a non-anticipating random

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,360
variable

185
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:29,640
we can consider a transformation of the

186
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,640
original martingale

187
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:39,040
given by M's with no tildas.

188
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,120
um and consider a transformation of the

189
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,279
MN martingale

190
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,399
by considering this decomposition

191
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,079
of m tilda. So we have an initial value

192
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,399
m0.

193
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:57,600
Then we have the non-anticipating

194
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,640
uh variable A1 that depends only on

195
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,680
information at time zero times the

196
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,120
increment of the martingale from time

197
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,120
zero to time 1 and we add successive

198
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:15,040
terms. So these A's basically are random

199
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,320
variables at the beginning of time.

200
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:26,880
But after observing

201
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:30,160
say J time periods the AJ uh AJ uh let's

202
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:35,600
see will be or J minus one time periods

203
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:41,680
the AJ uh will be defined and non-random

204
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:45,680
going from time J to J + one. Now the uh

205
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,680
and if you were to look at um this M

206
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,079
tilda subn

207
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,279
definition, we basically have terms that

208
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,839
are given by increments of the

209
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,440
martingale process

210
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,959
which where each of those increments has

211
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,880
expectation equal to zero.

212
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:15,040
And so if we take the expectation of

213
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:18,720
those um from time zero then uh by

214
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,360
conditional expectation properties

215
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:28,000
um the a's uh are sort of fixed given

216
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:32,720
the information up to time uh n min or j

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,839
minus one and then the uh variation from

218
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,279
uh of the martin Martell process from

219
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,560
time J minus one to J uh is has

220
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,200
expectation zero. Anyway,

221
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,519
the martingale transform transform

222
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,920
theorem says that this m tilda n process

223
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:59,040
is a martingale also with respect to the

224
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,920
uh information sets fn and we often call

225
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,079
this collection of information sets sort

226
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,880
of a filtration

227
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,160
and so when we think of different

228
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,680
processes different realizations of a

229
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,040
process

230
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:22,639
um up to time n. Then uh whatever the

231
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:26,720
history is prior to n um that is the

232
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:31,680
information set we have available and as

233
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:35,680
we observe successive values of the uh

234
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,360
original MN process um we're basically

235
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,440
adding sort of more information about

236
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,800
the realizations

237
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:50,000
um and uh That's that's how it

238
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:53,760
progresses. Now, um with Martingales, an

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,560
important concept for us is a stopping

240
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:01,360
time random variable, which we'll call

241
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:07,199
TOAO. And so what the stopping time

242
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:10,000
variable is is a random variable

243
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,199
that

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,880
characterizes whether

245
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,920
the uh let's say I guess at any time n

246
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:26,399
we know whether the the stopping time

247
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:29,920
has occurred or not. So the event of the

248
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:34,000
stopping time being less than n less

249
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,600
than or equal to n steps that has to be

250
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,279
known in the information set up to time

251
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:46,880
n. So the notation here is a little bit

252
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:51,360
uh tricky. We think of this set or event

253
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,880
being the pro the the the underlying

254
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,959
probability distribution states where

255
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,720
the tow variable is less than or equal

256
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:05,040
to n

257
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,759
and at any time n we know whether this

258
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,600
set

259
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:17,600
has occurred or not. So the stopping

260
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:21,360
time uh is a random variable uh and it

261
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:25,680
could be infinite. So it takes values on

262
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,639
the set s varying from zero uh up to

263
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,920
possibly infinity if the process never

264
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:38,880
stops. Now a way of trying to help

265
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,959
explain this is with a stopping time

266
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,560
random variable we have different

267
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,360
omegas

268
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,920
in the probability space and the omegas

269
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,240
can be thought of as indexing all

270
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,639
possible paths.

271
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,880
So with different realizations we have a

272
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:03,199
different omega.

273
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,959
And so with these uh paths our

274
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,439
expectation

275
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:11,439
or our event E which is the set of paths

276
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,799
for which

277
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,000
the stopping time evaluated on that path

278
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,280
is less than or equal to n. um this

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,559
event is known

280
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,400
to either have occurred or not to occur.

281
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:32,320
So we have the indicator

282
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,600
of the path being in this set E is

283
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:40,480
either zero or one.

284
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,360
And so we can uh work with this sort of

285
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,360
random variable

286
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,600
uh the indicator of of the uh of whether

287
00:17:47,360 --> 00:18:00,000
the stopping time has occurred or not.

288
00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:03,520
And with this um setup we can think of

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,880
the process that is sort of governed by

290
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:11,919
a stopping time toao. We can represent

291
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:17,039
the process at the stopped time towo as

292
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:20,000
the sum of the realizations xn times a

293
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:25,679
simple indicator of whether the stopping

294
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:31,280
time equals n or not. So we basically

295
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:33,120
have our stopped process being a sum

296
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,960
of

297
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,080
weights time the xns where those weights

298
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,559
are actually zero or one.

299
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,799
Um now in the mathematics of dealing

300
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,919
with stopping times

301
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:54,640
uh the potential for infinite values uh

302
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,160
of the stopping time makes things

303
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,160
complicated.

304
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:04,080
And what we can do is consider the

305
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,919
minimum of n and the stopping time

306
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,000
towel.

307
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:14,799
Denoting that by n carrot towel. So the

308
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:19,520
minimum of n and toao. And so if we have

309
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,840
a finite value n, this truncated

310
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,880
stopping time

311
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,760
is going to be a measurable

312
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,400
random variable

313
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:36,320
with respect to the set the information

314
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,640
set script fm information set fm for m

315
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:45,840
greater than or equal to n. So if we

316
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,080
imagine um basically this time

317
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,160
increasing

318
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:57,280
um and we think of n

319
00:19:52,160 --> 00:20:03,120
the minimum of n and toao then we will

320
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:05,600
be considering processes that maybe stop

321
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,160
for a given towo for a given

322
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,160
realization.

323
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,080
or if they don't really stop until

324
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,000
later, we just consider the value at the

325
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,039
end point.

326
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,039
Now um this theorem

327
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:29,840
can be proven with this argument

328
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:32,480
and what you can see is that we define

329
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:38,960
our non-anticipating

330
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:40,480
variables to be the indicator of tow the

331
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,480
stopping time being greater than or

332
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,960
equal to k.

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:51,120
And so substituting that in to the

334
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:56,400
formula for the decomposition um we end

335
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,159
up getting that this uh

336
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,760
stopped

337
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,880
martingale at time uh the minimum of n

338
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,679
or toao is actually equal to the sum of

339
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,120
these non-anticipating variables times

340
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:16,480
the increments of the martingale. So

341
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:20,000
this is easily a martingale uh transform

342
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:24,400
u and satisfies the martingale transform

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,520
theorem. So this uh sort of stopped

344
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,720
martingale at the minimum of n and toao

345
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:36,080
is also a martingale. What we then want

346
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,159
to do is consider taking

347
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,960
let's see I'm not sure if we do it here

348
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,840
shortly or or not but we'll basically

349
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,880
let little n grow large and argue that

350
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,720
in the limiting case um we basically

351
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,039
have the stopped martingale without the

352
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,799
minimum of n and

353
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:03,440
well um let's look at this simple random

354
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:08,480
walk we had before where the steps are +

355
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:13,120
one or minus one and we consider Sn

356
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:16,640
being the sum of the steps. Um, this can

357
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,799
be uh used to characterize the problem

358
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:24,000
of playing against an opponent and

359
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:28,400
betting one dollar with each iteration

360
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,919
of the game and you either win or lose

361
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:37,600
that dollar each uh iteration of the

362
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:41,280
game. And we can consider uh

363
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,120
having a uh

364
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,799
hit level for the

365
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:54,400
uh sum Sn being equal to plus a or minus

366
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:58,480
b. And so um the uh basically this

367
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:02,960
reflects whether we beat our opponent or

368
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,720
not where um our opponent

369
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,640
uh has

370
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,240
um a uh well let's see

371
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,480
where let's see if we have a bankroll B

372
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:20,240
and our opponent has a bankroll A um do

373
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,440
we win the entire bankroll control of

374
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,360
our opponent and hit A first.

375
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,880
Um

376
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,880
so we have uh this problem and we want

377
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:36,559
to know what's the likelihood of uh

378
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:41,039
basically player one losing

379
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:47,039
um and the SN is a martingale

380
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:53,280
and toao the time at which the sum sn=

381
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:55,760
plus a or minus b um is a mark is is a

382
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,200
stopping time. And so this is a

383
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,840
martingale by the stopping time theorem.

384
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,400
And with such a martingale,

385
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:09,760
we have that

386
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:13,840
the expected value of s at the stopped

387
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,240
time is equal to the expected value

388
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,720
initially

389
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:24,960
and uh that is equal to zero.

390
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,640
starting out at time zero uh sn is equal

391
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,960
to zero.

392
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,799
And so if we take the limit as n goes to

393
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,080
infinity, this converges to

394
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:42,320
the random variable s tow with

395
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,240
probability one. And this is proven

396
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,480
partly by

397
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,760
showing that

398
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,480
it the stopping time can't be infinite.

399
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:57,279
But if we assume that this these results

400
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:01,360
are uh valid then we have zero is equal

401
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:04,559
to the expected value of s tow. And if

402
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,520
we write out what s tow is at the

403
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:14,640
stopping time toao, it's either going to

404
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:20,799
equal a * the s tow hitting a or minus b

405
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:24,559
* the stopped value uh equaling minus b.

406
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:28,480
And if we take expectations of this

407
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:32,240
equation, we basically have zero is

408
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:36,720
equal to a times the probability that we

409
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,200
hit the level plus a minus b * the

410
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,760
probability that we hit minus b. And

411
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,000
those probabilities are complements of

412
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,600
each other.

413
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,320
So

414
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,320
the chance that we hit minus B at the

415
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,960
stop time is one minus the probability

416
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,520
that we hit A. So using these uh

417
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,720
relationships we get that the

418
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:05,679
probability that that we hit A first is

419
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,679
B over A + B. Yes.

420
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,320
>> So on the previous slide, can I just

421
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,799
check? I don't know might be an error or

422
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,880
if I don't understand something. Is it

423
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,400
meant to say solve for S to equals plus

424
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,440
A

425
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,440
where this problem involved?

426
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,360
>> Let's see. Can you ask the question

427
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
again?

428
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,120
>> So where this problem involved with the

429
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,760
code and then like problem solve?

430
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
>> Oh,

431
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,320
>> you meant to say probability that

432
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,200
Stowals plus.

433
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,559
>> Oh yes, it's probably the S to equals

434
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,720
plus A.

435
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
>> Yes, definitely.

436
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,679
Um,

437
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,600
>> no. No, that's fine. That's fine.

438
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,840
There's always typos. uh fewer typos on

439
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,320
slides than on the blackboard. I would

440
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,880
say that's the the benefit of having the

441
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,600
slides and easier to fix. All right,

442
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,159
thank you for that. All right, so so we

443
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,840
get this really nice formula for the

444
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,159
likelihood of hitting A before hitting

445
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,799
minus B.

446
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,000
And so

447
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,320
by symmetry, if A equals B, then this is

448
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,200
simply a half.

449
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:22,400
But if the player sort of B has a larger

450
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:27,200
bankroll then um the chance of taking

451
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:30,000
all the money from A uh basically uh

452
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,480
goes to one.

453
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,600
So it makes sense that if you're going

454
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,279
to gamble with sort of fair odds, you

455
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,480
you have an advantage if you have a

456
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,000
bigger bankroll than your opponent.

457
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,240
Now

458
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,880
this second example of uh martingales

459
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:54,399
which is sort of the square of the

460
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,919
random walk sn minus n um this is a

461
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:01,600
martingale

462
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:06,399
as well and if we look at the uh

463
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:10,000
uh this martingale it's bounded um

464
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:14,000
by uh the max of a^2 b² plus to. So we

465
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,120
have a bounded uh transformation

466
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,279
of uh the original SN. And so this

467
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,520
martinale is um has expectation zero for

468
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,399
all n.

469
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:34,880
And so if we look at the expectation

470
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:39,039
of M towel, this transformation of the

471
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:43,120
original martingale sort of Sn

472
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:47,200
um it has zero expectation

473
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,840
which is equal to the expected value of

474
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,679
S to squar minus the expected value of

475
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,200
TOA.

476
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,640
And

477
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:01,120
if we look at what is the expected value

478
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:06,640
of S ta squared.

479
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:09,919
So this term here um we have that that's

480
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:14,000
equal to

481
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,799
being stopped at plus a * a^ 2 plus the

482
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,840
probability being stopped at minus b * b

483
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:25,919
^ 2. And this expectation is equal to

484
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,399
zero. So we can actually solve for the

485
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:32,000
expected value of toao. It's simply

486
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,600
equal to the expected value of s to squ.

487
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,799
So

488
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,000
plugging everything in um it gets a

489
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:43,279
little tricky until we simplify and it's

490
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,679
simply the product of a * b.

491
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:51,360
So the amount of time it takes to

492
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:55,520
defeat the opponent

493
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,640
has an expected time equal to a * b.

494
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,080
So if you're gambling

495
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,799
uh in the in such a situation, the size

496
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,520
of your bankroll sort of times the size

497
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,240
of the other person's bankroll estimates

498
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,080
the approximate time it will take to

499
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:18,640
finish the game with one dominating the

500
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,760
other. Um anyway what's what's

501
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,159
characteristic of these examples is we

502
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,960
have a martingale

503
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,600
transform of the original series. It has

504
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,919
a zero expectation

505
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:37,279
um as as it's defined and that zero

506
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,120
expectation applies for all time points

507
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,200
as well as the stopping time.

508
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,880
All right.

509
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:52,399
Well, um, a really challenging

510
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:56,480
problem is to consider the random walk

511
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:59,919
with bias. So we consider

512
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,799
steps + one or minus one with

513
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,399
probability p and 1 minus p

514
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:09,760
respectively.

515
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,360
And then we're interested in what is the

516
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,000
uh

517
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:20,559
what is the probability of hitting plus

518
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,640
a say in this case. Certainly as uh p

519
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,559
increases the probability of hitting

520
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:30,480
plus a first increases.

521
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,679
Um but how does it do so? Now some of

522
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,320
you have taken stochcastic processes

523
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,240
already or how many people have taken

524
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,440
the course in stochastic processes?

525
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,480
Maybe just a couple. Um

526
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,039
do you recall this problem being covered

527
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,039
in your course?

528
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,720
And uh when I uh taught the stochastic

529
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,559
processes course about five or six years

530
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:02,640
ago, the way this was solved

531
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,320
um was sort of by brute force

532
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,600
understanding

533
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:12,640
the dynamics of the process and doing

534
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,399
computations with sort of first step

535
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,919
analyses.

536
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,279
And

537
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,080
the solution was really quite complex,

538
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,399
but it got the right answer. What's

539
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,600
really neat about Martingales is that we

540
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,480
can actually solve this problem pretty

541
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,480
elegantly. And so we're going to use

542
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,399
this moment generating function

543
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,519
transformation.

544
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,039
So our XNS have a moment generating

545
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,200
function

546
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:48,000
which is P the probability of + one time

547
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:52,960
E to the lambda * + one plus Q the

548
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,080
probability of -1 * E to the lambda *

549
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,760
-1. So this definition of the moment

550
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,000
generating function is very

551
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,480
straightforward.

552
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,200
If we take e to the lambda xn / v, these

553
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:12,000
are independent random variables that

554
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:15,679
have expectation equal to 1.

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,120
And we can define mn to be the product

556
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,399
of the first n yis.

557
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,120
And this will be a martingale by our

558
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,120
example four.

559
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,440
And

560
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,240
if

561
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:39,519
we solve for the lambda value

562
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,279
that makes f of lambda equal to one.

563
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,399
Then

564
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:49,120
for that fixed value of lambda this mn

565
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,440
is going to be a martingale. It's

566
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,799
actually a martingale for any lambda.

567
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,600
But in addition that special case where

568
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,320
f of lambda equals 1.

569
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,039
And so if we graph this moment

570
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,559
generating function as a function of

571
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,800
lambda,

572
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:12,480
we can see that it's equal to um equal

573
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:19,520
to one when e to the lambda is equal to

574
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:21,760
q over p. So this uh so mn for this

575
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,839
particular lambda

576
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:30,879
for which e to the lambda equals q over

577
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:34,159
p is simply q over p to the power sn.

578
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:39,040
And with that we basically have the

579
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:41,919
initial value of m at time one basically

580
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,240
or at time zero is one and that should

581
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:50,079
equal the stopped value of q over p to

582
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,200
the power s n at the stopped value. So

583
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,000
it's Q over P to the + A time the

584
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,320
probability of stopping at A plus Q over

585
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,280
P to the minus B * the probability of

586
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:06,400
stopping at minus B.

587
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:10,560
And again this equation basically gives

588
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,119
us two terms that are related to each

589
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,680
other that we can solve for. So we get

590
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:22,160
the probability that this biased random

591
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:26,320
walk stops at or hits plus a first is

592
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:30,640
simply the ratio of q to p to the power

593
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:35,599
b minus one over the same ratio to the

594
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:39,359
power a + b. So so this result is very

595
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:44,079
direct and

596
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:47,520
elegant. Um, if you look at stochastic

597
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,400
processes books that try to solve this

598
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,040
biased random walk problem without

599
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,880
martingale theory, it's a a bit more

600
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,280
involved and tricky. Um,

601
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,520
all right. So, here's just some R code

602
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,960
that will graph these probabilities as

603
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,920
functions of A and B. Um, I think it's

604
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,000
useful only just to know that you can do

605
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,560
something like this. You can graph the

606
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,079
probability surface as it varies with

607
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,520
the hit levels A and B. And here are

608
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,400
contours of the different uh

609
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,160
probabilities which can also be graphed

610
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,880
easily. And that's um sort of finishes

611
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:35,119
this initial discussion of of

612
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:37,440
martinales. Now a second uh topic in

613
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:42,000
stochastic processes

614
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:45,839
um that um is extremely important is the

615
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,640
concept of marov processes.

616
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,640
And so if we think of a general

617
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:56,000
stochcastic process xt

618
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,599
um then we will say that

619
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,960
the process is a marov process.

620
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:07,359
If for any times of the process

621
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:13,599
s

622
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:17,440
that's between u and t um that xt will

623
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:24,320
be independent of all xus

624
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:25,839
where u is less than s. So when we think

625
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,079
of

626
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:33,720
a time scale,

627
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,720
so we have u less than s less than t.

628
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,560
If we imagine realizations of a

629
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,480
stochastic process

630
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:51,680
and we are interested in

631
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:54,079
looking at the value of xt

632
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,320
Um

633
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:03,599
the value of XT

634
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:06,960
given information on times S and before

635
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,320
will be independent

636
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:15,320
of all of the times before.

637
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,320
And so the conditional distribution

638
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,680
so

639
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:28,800
so the distribution of XT given all of

640
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:31,760
the values of X prior to time u is equal

641
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,280
in distribution as the has the same

642
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,800
random distribution as

643
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,079
just the conditional distribution given

644
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,960
XS

645
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,880
So with a markov process

646
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,599
the future

647
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,760
depends on the past

648
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:55,520
only through the last value of the past.

649
00:38:51,760 --> 00:39:00,560
It doesn't matter how one

650
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,560
arrived at a given value at time s for

651
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,960
different realizations that have the

652
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,760
same end point.

653
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,560
It's only that end point that sort of

654
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,960
indexes the distributions into the

655
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,880
future. So this is a markoff process.

656
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,119
It's like a uh um

657
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,119
it's it's

658
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,880
um sort of a a simple model where the

659
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,640
past

660
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,760
information can be encapsulated just in

661
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,000
the last observed value not in the

662
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,320
realizations of how that value was achie

663
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,960
was achieved.

664
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,680
Okay. So this is just some notation for

665
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:50,400
trying to say what I just said. Um now

666
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:55,680
with um marov chains these are

667
00:39:50,400 --> 00:40:00,880
interesting stochastic processes where

668
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:04,560
we consider there being a state space

669
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,000
s capital s that where where we can

670
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,480
index possible states of the process

671
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,760
beginning say with zero

672
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,720
uh and the integers and it could be a

673
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,839
finite number or a countably infinite

674
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:25,599
number. And then we have a time index

675
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:28,480
set um with n varying from zero

676
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:33,680
to the through the positive integers.

677
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:37,040
And so the markoff property with this

678
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,520
uh markoff or with this with this uh

679
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:45,680
stochcastic process

680
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:49,200
um would have that uh the probability

681
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:54,160
of the next step

682
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:57,359
next state being J from time N given

683
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:02,960
the values of the process X knot through

684
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:06,480
XN. And um this conditional probability

685
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:11,520
is equal to the conditional probability

686
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:17,920
of J state at time n + one just given

687
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:20,640
that xn uh is equal to i. So this is uh

688
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,960
a nice property

689
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:30,160
for processes that makes their analysis

690
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,560
um a bit less complex. Um

691
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,599
and

692
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:42,560
what's important in this definition of

693
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:44,640
the uh Markov process is that um there's

694
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,680
a onestep

695
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,839
transition probability

696
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,280
from state

697
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:56,960
I to state J

698
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:01,680
from time N to N + one.

699
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:04,319
And these transition probabilities

700
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,200
um together with

701
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,839
the probabilities of the initial states

702
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,040
completely specifies the stochastic

703
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,520
process. Now this issue of completely

704
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:20,480
specifying a stochcastic process is an

705
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:23,520
important one in that what we want with

706
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,839
a stochastic process is to have a

707
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,440
complete probability model of that

708
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,800
process.

709
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,599
And so if we have sort of an initial

710
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,200
state x0

711
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:41,760
and the probabilities over

712
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,720
all states i and s that characterizes

713
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,520
the probability model for

714
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:52,560
the state zero value. Then if we look at

715
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:57,520
the probabil the conditional probability

716
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:00,880
from time n= 0 to n

717
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,440
to to or from zero to one. We then have

718
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,599
the conditional probabilities of moving

719
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:11,359
from any state

720
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:14,240
zero to any state and and at time one.

721
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,119
And so those

722
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,240
conditional probabilities together with

723
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,800
the marginal probabilities specify the

724
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,319
distribution of the process over state

725
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,319
zero and one. And we can continue this

726
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,800
computation

727
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,520
uh for successive time points and

728
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:38,160
completely specify our uh stochastic

729
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,599
process. Now

730
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,359
the general marov process as introduced

731
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:48,319
there is very complex because we may

732
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,800
have different transition probabilities

733
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,960
depending upon how long the process has

734
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,040
been operating.

735
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:01,040
A simple case is called a stationary

736
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:04,400
markoff process where these transition

737
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,640
probabilities one state one step

738
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,319
transition probabilities

739
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,240
do not depend on the time. So we have

740
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,319
the same probabilities of moving from

741
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:20,800
one state to another regardless of when

742
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:24,800
that is occurring. And so we can define

743
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,640
a matrix P which is the collection of

744
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:32,079
all sort of pair-wise probabilities pig

745
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,400
J moving from uh basically state I to

746
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,000
state J

747
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,079
and

748
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,920
we basically

749
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,720
require that these transition

750
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,319
probabilities are non- negative and the

751
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,680
sum over sort of target states J from

752
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:53,280
state I that those probabilities sum to

753
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,880
one for a stationary uh transition

754
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,880
probability matrix.

755
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,640
and

756
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,240
to sort of define the uh probability

757
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,359
distribution

758
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:11,760
of the entire process XN using this

759
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,000
stationary transition probability matrix

760
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:19,920
and initial probabilities.

761
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,440
Um we can compute any probabilities

762
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,319
by

763
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,640
computing the collection of all such

764
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:31,839
probabilities where we have sort of n

765
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,760
steps of the process or n time points of

766
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:38,720
the process and states i not through i

767
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,119
little n um there. So if we can

768
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,119
calculate these probabilities

769
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,720
uh we will have specified the

770
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:52,880
probability model. Now um in calculating

771
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:57,520
the joint probability of the first

772
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:01,760
little n values states being i 0 through

773
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,480
i n. Um we can decompose

774
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,200
this probability into

775
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,000
the marginal probability of the first n

776
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,680
minus one

777
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:18,000
and times the conditional probability of

778
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:25,359
the last given the others. So

779
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:30,319
if we think of sort of a equaling x0

780
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:36,160
up to x n -1 = i n -1

781
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:39,440
and uh b is equal to um

782
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,640
xn = i

783
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:47,839
then um

784
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:52,240
we can look at the probability of A and

785
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:56,680
B is equal to the probability of A times

786
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,680
the probability of B given A.

787
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,160
And this is basically what's written up

788
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,640
there. Um and this formula on the

789
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,400
blackboard is simply BA's formula

790
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,000
relating sort of the conditional

791
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:17,520
probability of B given A to the

792
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,160
probabilities of A and B. So probability

793
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,160
of B given A.

794
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:36,240
Now um with this

795
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,800
second equation we can simplify that to

796
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:44,480
the red probability which is only

797
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:50,160
depending upon the n minus one value.

798
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:53,280
And so um we have that the this

799
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,359
probability is equal to the marginal

800
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,599
probability of the first n minus one

801
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,599
times the

802
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:06,880
transition probability from state n

803
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,280
i i n minus one to i n and that won't

804
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:15,359
depend on n

805
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:18,720
and so um we can basically by induction

806
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:22,720
basically replace each of the successive

807
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,920
uh state transitions by the probability

808
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,160
of moving from one state to another and

809
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,240
the successive transitions of all those

810
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:36,160
states. So this joint probability

811
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,880
can be represented in this form

812
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,599
uh exploiting the markov property to

813
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:47,599
simplify the onestep transitions

814
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:52,440
and uh using the uh uh stationary uh

815
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,440
property to define these pigs.

816
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,800
Okay. Well, with a stationary transition

817
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,599
probabilities,

818
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:06,240
uh the multi-step transition

819
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,160
probabilities turn out to have a really

820
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:13,359
nice form.

821
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:17,440
And so we can represent

822
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:18,960
the transition probability matrix over n

823
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,240
steps

824
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,559
as the nth power of the onestep

825
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,079
transition probabilities

826
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,640
matrices.

827
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:33,839
So this property of uh markov change

828
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:39,200
with stationary transition probabilities

829
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:42,400
is very nice and uh gives us this this

830
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,520
result. Um

831
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,160
now um let's see there's

832
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,960
in terms of proving this okay there's

833
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,119
this analysis

834
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,480
called first step analysis in

835
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,040
stochcastic processes that's a really

836
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,559
useful tool for proving different

837
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,880
results

838
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,640
and

839
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,800
this uh first step

840
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,119
uh

841
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,240
prob uh analysis basically says okay if

842
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:21,040
we want to calculate the probability of

843
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:25,680
going from state zero sorry state i to j

844
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:29,359
um in n steps that's like starting at

845
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:34,400
time zero and state i and transitioning

846
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:36,720
to state j then we can

847
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,480
consider we can decompose this

848
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,800
probability

849
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,720
into the sum

850
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:49,680
over all possible first steps going from

851
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:54,079
I to K in state one and then from state

852
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:58,559
K to J

853
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:03,520
by time N. And so this first

854
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:05,599
equation here is a first step equation

855
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,200
of the probabilities. We can basically

856
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,240
decompose the process of going from

857
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:18,160
state I to J and N steps as going from

858
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:23,520
state I to each K state in step one and

859
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:28,800
then going from uh state K to N in n

860
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:30,319
minus one steps. So this is um

861
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,079
that

862
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:38,720
uh

863
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:42,960
formula. Um and so if we uh

864
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,640
write this out um we end up getting the

865
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,240
uh

866
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,880
xn

867
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:54,880
equaling or this in blue is equal to the

868
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:58,640
term above in black because of the uh

869
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,400
marov nature of the marov property of

870
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:04,960
the process.

871
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:08,240
And so we basically have this sum of pi

872
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,760
k um

873
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:20,079
times probability of uh xn minus one

874
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:22,480
equaling j x= k. And so um so this uh

875
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:26,000
so we end up basically getting this

876
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:29,200
matrix equation of the nstep transition

877
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,400
probabilities is equal to the onestep

878
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:36,240
matrix P * the n minus one step

879
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:40,559
transition probability matrix in green.

880
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay. Well, um these transition

881
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,920
probabilities together with the marginal

882
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,880
distribution of the initial state gives

883
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:54,720
us the marginal distribution of xn at

884
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:56,640
any uh time. So um okay so the these

885
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,680
formulas just indicate how we do these

886
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,280
computations. Now where do marov chains

887
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,880
arise

888
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:09,520
in finance? Well, one example to think

889
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,200
about is how companies have credit

890
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,319
ratings

891
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:18,640
and those credit ratings range from high

892
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:23,760
credit meaning which is AAA and low

893
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:27,040
credit being I guess C D being default

894
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:31,440
is uh sort of maybe a terminal state at

895
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:35,839
least in some sense. Uh but companies

896
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,359
are graded or rated by standard and

897
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:42,640
pores and Fitch and other rating

898
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:46,559
agencies and depending upon how good

899
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:50,720
their credit rating is, they can borrow

900
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:54,160
money at lower interest rates.

901
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,319
And the way corporations borrow money is

902
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,920
to issue a bond paying a certain

903
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:05,040
interest rate and having that interest

904
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:08,720
rate be attractive to lenders. And the

905
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,359
way that

906
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:16,240
such a loan contract is attractive to

907
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:20,079
lenders is with um a high interest rate

908
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,680
to the lender but um a low risk of

909
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,720
default

910
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:28,559
uh by the uh borrower.

911
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:32,800
And so, um, one can think about how

912
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:37,119
these, uh, credit ratings vary, uh, from

913
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,280
one, uh, period to the next. And here's

914
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:43,040
a, uh,

915
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:46,800
table of sort of migration probabilities

916
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,800
from one year to the next. And one can

917
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,240
see that

918
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:56,880
AAA initial ratings

919
00:54:52,240 --> 00:55:00,880
had only a 43% chance of staying AAA at

920
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,599
the end of that one year. Um and there

921
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:10,559
was a very low probability of downgrades

922
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:12,160
to you know C triple C or B. Um and uh

923
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,480
with

924
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,839
say very low credit rating companies the

925
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:25,040
chance of their basically increasing

926
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:28,880
their credit rating to be was 41%

927
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:33,040
staying at triple C is 32% but almost a

928
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:36,640
20% chance of defaulting perhaps. So, so

929
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:40,079
these kinds of uh

930
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:45,440
me metrics um basically can be uh

931
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:50,240
analyzed sort of with the tools of uh uh

932
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:53,440
uh Markov chains. Um and uh let's see

933
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:58,240
then another example um that I put

934
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:01,359
together is looking at the stock price

935
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,400
dynamics of

936
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:09,119
any stock but I chose Apple

937
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,960
and using daily prices to consider

938
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,599
states

939
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:19,680
of the Apple stock price which is is it

940
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:23,599
an upday or a down day. Is the price at

941
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:26,000
day t higher than t minus one or is it a

942
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,000
down day? I guess one of those should

943
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,040
probably be a less than or equal to if

944
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,160
they if we want to in incorporate

945
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:38,799
everything. Um but we can consider

946
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:42,559
defining a um a two-day

947
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:44,400
uh state which is

948
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,720
let's see the formatting here is a

949
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,280
little off but we could have two up days

950
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,119
in a row.

951
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,599
An up day followed by a down day. A down

952
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,000
day followed by an up day and a down day

953
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:02,880
followed by a down day.

954
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:08,160
and look at trying to model the state

955
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:13,040
changes for a two-day state um with a uh

956
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:15,680
marov chain and in R there's a nice R

957
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:19,359
package that

958
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:23,520
will do this for us and this u was

959
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:25,440
distributed in the canvas site

960
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,160
and so you should be able to replicate

961
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,960
this example

962
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:34,720
with Apple or choose any other stock you

963
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,480
might be interested in. And so

964
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,680
importantly,

965
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:44,400
okay, this uses the library quant here.

966
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,000
It's sort of hard to see.

967
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,480
Let's see. So there's a library quant

968
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,960
which allows us to collect price data

969
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,839
from the internet. And then there's this

970
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,319
uh package markoff chain which allows us

971
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:06,799
to specify

972
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:11,280
Markovchain uh models. And so with this

973
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:14,640
our code um it basically collects the

974
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,559
data on

975
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,079
Apple stock.

976
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,599
And

977
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,160
yeah, I think what's what I really want

978
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:24,880
to emphasize for everyone is that these

979
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,559
examples and it's a it's a bit tedious

980
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,680
if you want to go through these examples

981
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:32,559
yourself. However, the examples should

982
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:36,400
work just with clicking a button saying

983
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,720
run and you can replicate these. And so

984
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,880
for the Apple stock, we just needed to

985
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:46,319
substitute in the Apple symbol

986
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:51,599
and collect the data. And so here's the

987
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:53,280
Apple stock price from 2014 or 2013

988
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,160
through

989
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,160
um a week ago.

990
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,160
And

991
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:06,240
I considered just fitting a marov chain

992
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:09,359
model for these up and down states to

993
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:14,079
the last uh four and a half years.

994
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:15,599
And so the code here goes through

995
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,839
and

996
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:23,599
basically with Apple prices,

997
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:25,920
Apple closing prices. Here we define

998
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:30,079
differences in closing prices for two

999
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:34,839
lags and then talk about

1000
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,839
defining up days

1001
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:41,599
in this section here. up down days down

1002
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:44,079
up and so forth.

1003
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:48,079
And then if we graph

1004
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:52,960
these states, say from May of this year

1005
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:54,799
to the end of August, this shows how

1006
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:59,119
this

1007
00:59:54,799 --> 01:00:01,760
four-state marov chain evolved over

1008
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,760
these dates.

1009
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,760
And

1010
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:15,920
we can just use the marov chain function

1011
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,599
uh

1012
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:24,079
or let's see we can plot a marov chain

1013
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:26,319
function um or a markov chain trans uh

1014
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,839
transition states

1015
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:30,400
um

1016
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:32,640
as this graph here. So what's what this

1017
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,520
code does is it looks at transitions

1018
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,599
from one day to the next and calculates

1019
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,720
the probabilities of going from one

1020
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:46,880
state to another. So the sums across

1021
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:50,079
rows equals 1 and uh this graph this

1022
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,160
plot shows basically what is happening

1023
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,000
with the marov chain. We have different

1024
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,760
states

1025
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:01,200
given by the nodes and then we can

1026
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:05,359
transition from between nodes by which

1027
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:08,240
arrows are feasible and this Markov

1028
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:10,960
chain package will give us the

1029
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:14,720
probabilities empirical probabilities of

1030
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:18,160
moving from one state to another. And so

1031
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:22,960
one can see that um

1032
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:26,640
two up days in Apple are likely to be

1033
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:30,160
followed by two up days

1034
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:32,960
again. So that we'd get a third up day

1035
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,880
with that one-step transition. Two down

1036
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:40,000
days are not likely to be followed by a

1037
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:46,240
third down day because it won't go to

1038
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,319
that down state. uh with probability or

1039
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:52,559
more than 0.5 or so um so there tends to

1040
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:56,319
perhaps be reversals from double down

1041
01:01:52,559 --> 01:02:01,119
days and a continuation of up days as

1042
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:03,520
sort of suggested by by these graphs. Um

1043
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:06,640
now

1044
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:09,359
with with this example I uh thought well

1045
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,640
maybe there would be some interesting

1046
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:14,480
structure if we defined three-day

1047
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:19,440
states.

1048
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:24,160
And so the same logic sort of gives us

1049
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:28,799
eight states of up or down on three

1050
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:32,240
successive days. And so sort of 2 * 2 *

1051
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:33,839
2 or 8 is the total number of possible

1052
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:37,920
states.

1053
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:41,680
And one can calculate the probabilities

1054
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:46,720
empirical probabilities of transitioning

1055
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:49,599
and then get um

1056
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:53,760
get this sort of display of the Markov

1057
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:56,880
chain with these eight states. And so

1058
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,839
what's rather

1059
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,480
curious just to focus on our three down

1060
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,760
days are not likely to be followed by a

1061
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:09,520
fourth and three up days maybe are

1062
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,640
likely to be followed by a fourth upday.

1063
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:18,400
So um so you get some insight perhaps

1064
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:21,440
into the overall dynamics and uh what's

1065
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,440
great to me is that we can visualize

1066
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,880
the process

1067
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:31,200
and the graphical representation

1068
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:34,480
of sort of nodes and edges between the

1069
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:37,680
nodes um that have probabilities is is

1070
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:42,160
quite useful. Um

1071
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:43,760
so let's see if if you study Markov

1072
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:48,240
chains

1073
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:51,920
um and uh then one can

1074
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:54,400
classify different states or different

1075
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,359
nodes as communicating

1076
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:01,200
states. So can you move from one state

1077
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:05,119
to another or not? And in this case, one

1078
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:08,480
can u move from one state to another

1079
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,520
possibly not in one time period but in

1080
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,880
multiple ones. And so uh this happens to

1081
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:19,039
be a strongly connected set of states.

1082
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:21,440
And let's see um

1083
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:27,200
there was this this sort of little note

1084
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:32,720
ends with um printing out the uh columns

1085
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:36,119
of the transition probability matrix for

1086
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,119
up moves

1087
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:48,079
and down moves. And so

1088
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:52,640
if we wanted to move from one state to

1089
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:57,039
an up move the next uh period. Then

1090
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:59,760
looking at this table, one can see that

1091
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,520
the highest probability

1092
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:06,240
of

1093
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:09,760
the 3-day state being up in the third

1094
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:12,880
day given the

1095
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:17,599
prior three

1096
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:21,280
day state. then it corresponds to three

1097
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:24,960
down days lead to an up day the next day

1098
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:28,799
with almost a 60% chance.

1099
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:32,079
And um one can also sort of do the same

1100
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:36,000
for down moves and see under what state

1101
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:39,440
are we most likely to have a down move.

1102
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And so this

1103
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:48,799
I think 0 510 is the highest which isn't

1104
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:52,640
much higher than 0.5 but um basically

1105
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:56,160
the past few days being a bit mixed uh

1106
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:59,280
but with two up days um preceded by a

1107
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,039
down day give us a higher likelihood of

1108
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:07,039
a

1109
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:10,559
uh down day. So um with let's see with

1110
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:13,200
this note the uh

1111
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,480
let's see there's a

1112
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:20,240
okay so here's the uh reference for this

1113
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,960
marov chain package and what's quite

1114
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:25,680
convenient with different R packages on

1115
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:30,319
different application

1116
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:32,559
uh topics is that the these articles

1117
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:35,520
often go through the mathematical

1118
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,520
background of the models. And so if you

1119
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,799
check out this

1120
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:44,000
discussion, this article on the Marov

1121
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:46,720
chain package, it actually will include

1122
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,240
issues of the mathematical issues of how

1123
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:52,960
you might classify different states and

1124
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:56,799
do various computations. So that's quite

1125
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:59,799
useful to uh uh have as a resource with

1126
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:59,799
these.

1127
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:07,920
Now um let's see with the uh

1128
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:12,480
R Studio cloud files that were

1129
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:16,000
distributed if you use those programs um

1130
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:18,880
you can change the symbols from Apple to

1131
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,039
any other and use different time periods

1132
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,599
to see whether these properties may be

1133
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,440
strong or not with other stocks. And I

1134
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:29,200
think that that might be an interesting

1135
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:31,359
thing to to check out. our

1136
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,079
next topic which is on regression

1137
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,720
analysis.

1138
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:39,119
And uh

1139
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:42,799
with regression

1140
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:45,680
uh we want to just review the notation

1141
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:48,960
and setup for multiple linear

1142
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:51,599
regression. Um, if you've taken any

1143
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,240
statistics class

1144
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,720
uh prior to this, which most of you

1145
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,200
have, you're very familiar with simple

1146
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,880
linear regression where you have one

1147
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:06,079
dependent variable and one predictor or

1148
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:08,480
explanatory variable. Um we want to

1149
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:12,319
consider the case of multiple linear

1150
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:16,480
regression where we have a single

1151
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:19,520
dependent variable and multiple

1152
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:22,799
predictor or explanatory variables given

1153
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,960
by X's and we want to describe the

1154
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:30,480
relationship between the dependent and

1155
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:32,640
independent variables. Now different

1156
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,239
regression problems can focus on

1157
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:37,199
prediction.

1158
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:40,319
This is actually one that I find most

1159
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:44,480
engaging at least trying to say predict

1160
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:47,520
stock prices over fixed horizons is is

1161
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:51,839
of real interest. Um but regression

1162
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:55,359
models can also be used to um make

1163
01:08:51,839 --> 01:09:00,480
inferences of causality.

1164
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:02,319
regression models arise in uh medical uh

1165
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,040
experiments

1166
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,679
where one of the explanatory variables

1167
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:11,839
corresponds to a treatment effect. One

1168
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:14,880
can also be interested in trying to um

1169
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:17,359
approximate the dependent variable by

1170
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,920
functions of the independent variables

1171
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,520
and understand their functional

1172
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:26,239
relationships.

1173
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:31,679
So this is all of these uh objectives

1174
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:33,440
can be um achieved with regression and

1175
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:39,359
we

1176
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:43,040
define a general linear model with

1177
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:47,839
these equations here. We basically have

1178
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:51,920
our observed yi values being a sum of a

1179
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:55,920
fit fitted value plus error. And the

1180
01:09:51,920 --> 01:10:00,400
fitted value y had i

1181
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:04,560
um is written here as a linear function

1182
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:08,880
of the independent variables x i with

1183
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:12,480
coefficients beta 1 through uh beta beta

1184
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,320
p. And um there's actually a a typo

1185
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:18,719
there. It shouldn't be beta sub. It

1186
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:22,719
should just be beta p there. And um with

1187
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:24,400
this setup, well, we could consider

1188
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,560
different

1189
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:33,280
explanatory variables that happen to be

1190
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:35,280
just different powers of one independent

1191
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:40,159
variable x.

1192
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:41,920
We could also consider for a series

1193
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,000
of

1194
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:47,280
x variables.

1195
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,600
Um, we could also have time series

1196
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,800
regressions where

1197
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,600
the independent variables x may

1198
01:10:52,800 --> 01:11:00,239
correspond to prior

1199
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:03,600
time values of the y series. And in all

1200
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:09,280
of these cases, what's really important

1201
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:11,440
is linearity of the fitted value yhat.

1202
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:15,199
And

1203
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,960
what's linear is not

1204
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:20,880
um

1205
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,679
is is not that it's the sum of x's so

1206
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:28,480
much as it is the regression parameters

1207
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:31,760
beta are a linear function of those. So

1208
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:35,440
the linearity of yhat

1209
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:38,800
in the regression parameters is a key

1210
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:40,480
property of this model and that

1211
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,440
linearity

1212
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:48,080
um dependence on the parameters allows

1213
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:50,400
us to specify the parameters. Now um let

1214
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:54,960
me just uh

1215
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:58,520
go to another example here.

1216
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,520
Let's see here.

1217
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:08,560
Okay. Um here's a time series of the

1218
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:12,159
high yield spread in u the bond markets.

1219
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:16,080
And so this is looking at the yield on

1220
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:19,920
bonds with a credit rating of B double A

1221
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:23,600
uh minus the yield on the US Treasury.

1222
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:27,120
And so this

1223
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:29,360
difference in yield tends to be positive

1224
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:33,760
well above two. It means that these

1225
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:37,760
lower credit rated companies have to pay

1226
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:42,880
more interest to lenders when they

1227
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:47,520
borrow money. But that excess rate above

1228
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:51,600
the treasury evolves over time and uh

1229
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:54,800
sometimes you know drops

1230
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:57,280
moderately or rises moderately. Now if

1231
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:01,760
we were to use just

1232
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:04,560
polomials to try and fit these well as

1233
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,199
we extend to sort of eighth order

1234
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,640
polomials we everyone here probably

1235
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:12,400
knows that with a high enough order

1236
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:16,480
polomial you can match any smooth curve.

1237
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,159
No surprise. Um do we expect this uh

1238
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,679
spread to actually follow some higher

1239
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:24,679
order polomial? Probably not.

1240
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,679
Um

1241
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:31,520
here's another example of using Fier

1242
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:35,760
series with the same

1243
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:39,120
spread uh time series. And so as we add

1244
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:42,480
in more terms in the Fier series, we're

1245
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,159
able to model higher frequency

1246
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:50,719
variations.

1247
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:54,000
And what this shows is just how uh

1248
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:58,719
I guess frequency analysis in financial

1249
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,400
series potentially can be useful. Um

1250
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:03,199
what's

1251
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:07,320
really surprising though um is if we do

1252
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:07,320
a auto regression

1253
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:13,600
where here is the high yield spread and

1254
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,560
then

1255
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,000
we

1256
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,679
basically have an auto reggression

1257
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,480
saying that the spread tomorrow is the

1258
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:28,400
same as the spread today or very very

1259
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:31,440
close. Then we get this blue curve

1260
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,920
fitting the black curve which is sort of

1261
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:38,400
over underneath the blue curve. So we

1262
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:40,719
get almost a perfect fit with um with

1263
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:45,199
this auto regression.

1264
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:49,679
So um there's a multiple R squared which

1265
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:53,760
we will introduce you to but of.99

1266
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:57,920
five for the auto regression. So the um

1267
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:59,920
use of historical values of a time

1268
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,560
series can be very powerful in

1269
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,960
predicting future values.

1270
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,880
All right. So, so in fitting a multiple

1271
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,600
regression model whether it's with time

1272
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:16,239
series factors or not um what we do is

1273
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:19,840
go through these steps of proposing a

1274
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:24,480
model step one and make assumptions

1275
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:27,199
about the error term epsilon and then

1276
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:30,239
second we define a criterion for judging

1277
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:33,520
different estimators

1278
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:37,280
and that that criterion can things like

1279
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:41,440
le squares or minimum mean squared

1280
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:44,159
prediction error or others and then

1281
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,320
characterize the best estimator using

1282
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:50,480
that criterion.

1283
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:54,400
Then we check whether the assumptions we

1284
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:57,440
made are in fact satisfied.

1285
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:00,560
And very often we'll discover that

1286
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:04,320
certain assumptions we make are not

1287
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:06,880
satisfied and we need to revise those

1288
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:09,040
and create a new model.

1289
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:13,280
So

1290
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:18,480
the models that um the model assumptions

1291
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:21,120
we uh apply include

1292
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:25,120
what are called Gaus Marov assumptions

1293
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:30,880
which is where we assume that the errors

1294
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:34,239
in the model have mean zero

1295
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,239
and constant variance.

1296
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,400
And so with this epsilon hat

1297
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,719
corresponding to the n cases in the

1298
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:51,679
series, we

1299
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,880
basically

1300
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:58,000
can assume these are mean zero and have

1301
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,920
standard deviation sigma. That's a

1302
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,640
constant.

1303
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,640
And that these are uncorrelated.

1304
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,520
uncorrelated.

1305
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:13,760
Um we could additionally assume that

1306
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:17,520
these errors are normally distributed

1307
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,840
or not. Um we can generalize the Gaus

1308
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,960
Marov to assume

1309
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:25,360
non-constant variances of the errors and

1310
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:28,000
possibly correlations of errors over

1311
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:30,800
time. We could also consider non-normal

1312
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,080
non-gaussian distributions. And all of

1313
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:37,440
these cases actually have a role in

1314
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:39,679
different uh in different contexts. In

1315
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,480
particular, I guess generalized Gaus

1316
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:45,199
Markoff methods apply with time series

1317
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:49,120
regressions and the non-normal

1318
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:53,360
non-Gaussian distributions arise um as

1319
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:55,920
well uh often with asset returns data.

1320
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:58,320
Now um in terms of what kind of

1321
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:02,159
criterion we should use for specifying

1322
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:04,159
parameters, we have le squares, maximum

1323
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:07,360
likelihood, robust methods, baze

1324
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:10,719
methods, a whole variety of methods. And

1325
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:14,640
what's really important to me is for

1326
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:17,760
people to have an understanding of what

1327
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:20,960
these different methods are and when you

1328
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,280
would prefer one method over another.

1329
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,640
And so what I think is a really

1330
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:29,520
important question to ask when doing

1331
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:34,000
empirical analyses with different models

1332
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:37,280
is um are your assumptions

1333
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:40,800
uh reasonable if not satisfied by the

1334
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,199
data you're modeling and with different

1335
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,239
criteria for judging different

1336
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:49,360
specifications of models.

1337
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:52,000
Are you using an appropriate criterion

1338
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:56,000
or not? Are there variations in that

1339
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:59,760
criterion that would lead to higher

1340
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,600
performance levels? So that for me is a

1341
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,120
guiding sort of question throughout

1342
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:08,880
these different checks. So with that um

1343
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:12,400
we'll finish today and next time we'll

1344
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:16,320
uh finish these notes going through

1345
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:20,480
ordinary le squares uh estimation.

1346
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,960
And what's useful about this development

1347
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:26,239
of le squares estimation is that it does

1348
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:28,880
so with linear algebra.

1349
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:30,560
And what we'll see is that uh with

1350
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,040
linear algebra we get very

1351
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:36,560
straightforward formulas for le squares

1352
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:38,560
estimates as well as interesting sort of

1353
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,679
analytical properties of those le

1354
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:45,000
squares estimates. So we'll cover that

1355
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,000
next time.
