1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,359
all right uh let's continue our

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,080
discussion of factor markets uh remember

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,359
to set the stage we are now in the

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,400
second half of the course talking about

5
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,880
the various elements that underly the

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,119
supply and demand model that we

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,119
developed in the first half of the

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,480
course and the first question we're

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,559
tackling is where to W andr come from

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,520
where do these prices that are the price

11
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,600
of firm inputs where do they come from

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,320
and they come of course from markets

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,760
markets of demand and Supply markets

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,200
four factors so let's start by doing the

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,120
labor market

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,199
equilibrium let's start by doing the

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,320
labor market

18
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,320
equilibrium and then we'll talk about

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,480
what effect a minimum

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,440
wage has in that

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,559
equilibrium okay so let's look at figure

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,840
16

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,799
1 figure 161 puts together the labor

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,159
market

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,640
equilibrium we have a a demand

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,680
curve the demand curve comes from firms

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,640
because in Factor markets firms are now

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,479
the demanders and people are the

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,400
suppliers so we flipped the tables from

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,479
a typical Market in a typical Market

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,640
cons in a consumer goods Market I'm

32
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,159
consumer goods Market firms Drive the

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
supply curve and consumers Drive the

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,040
demand curve that's no longer true true

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,680
now firms Drive the domain curve and

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,200
consumers Drive the supply curve so the

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,840
domain curve comes from the marginal

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,719
product of labor okay so we have uh a

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,200
demand curve in labor market equilibrium

40
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,320
here we're saying the demand curve is 70

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,560
minus

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,200
W we're saying that as the wage goes up

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
firms want fewer workers and we could

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,880
see that from our earlier firm

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,119
optimization okay but there's also

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,399
supply curve now we talked about last

47
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,920
time is the shape of the supply curve

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,679
here is indeterminant and that's because

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,720
income effects offset substitution

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,280
effects when Leisure is a normal good

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,959
okay that's the key lesson from last

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,400
lecture is that even when Leisure a

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,480
normal good income effects offset

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,640
substitution effects so we don't know

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,840
the shape of supply curve that said

56
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,560
we're going to pretty much for the rest

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,840
of the semester assume upward sloping

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,120
labor Supply curves we're going to

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
pretty much assume substitution effects

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,280
offset income effects because they hell

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
of a lot each to work with it's a mess

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,160
when they both slope down so we're

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,040
pretty much going to assume that

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,560
substitution effects Dominate and the

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,200
labor supply curve is upward sloping so

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,680
here for example we have a labor supply

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:53,440
curve um uh of the

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:57,480
form uh that uh labor equals um uh wus

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,680
10 so a higher wage leads to more labor

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,280
Supply okay so this uh uh so a higher

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,680
wage leads to more labor SL it should be

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,400
L equal 70 so this is the demand curve

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:13,360
the demand curve is L equal 70 minus W

74
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,080
the supply curve is uh Lal wus 10 so to

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,239
solve for equilibrium we simply set

76
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,000
those equal we know how to do that now

77
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,840
and you find the equilibrium is at 30

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,799
units of Labor with a wage of 40 that's

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,760
the point at which firms are happy to

80
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,560
hire workers and workers are happy to

81
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,400
work so it's the same kind of

82
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,120
equilibrium of goods markets

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,599
now it's just in a factor market

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,720
okay now let's ask what happens when we

85
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,000
add a minimum

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,360
wage what happens we add a minimum wage

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,720
which is a standard labor market

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,239
intervention all around the world okay

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,720
some of you may even enjoyed minimum

90
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,200
wage jobs at some point in your past

91
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,959
lives or hopefully not in your future

92
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,360
lives but some point in your past lives

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,439
uh it's a common feature of the

94
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,040
developed worlds have minimum wages the

95
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,840
way minimum wage work is the government

96
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,079
just sets a wage floor below which

97
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,239
employers cannot pay their employees

98
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,840
they set a wage floor so for example

99
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,519
imagine the government came in and set a

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:18,000
wage floor of 50 set a minimum wage of

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,519
50 above the market equilibrium

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
wage

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,680
okay so the new equilibrium

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,360
now is the new outcome the new market

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,520
outcome is actually at 0 two

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,080
why well because that higher wage firms

107
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,160
want to hire fewer

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,199
workers it doesn't matter what workers

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,840
want there's no jobs for them so firms

110
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,960
say fine if that higher wage I only want

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,280
20

112
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,240
workers workers say well gee at that

113
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,800
higher wage I want to work actually uh I

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,759
want to work much more than

115
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,840
that okay um Andrew in the future uh

116
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,840
diagram we should have the Y inter the x

117
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,520
intercept for the excess Supply um they

118
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,440
want to work much more than that so you

119
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,039
end up with an excess supply of

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
labor now when we talked about supply

121
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,400
and demand equilibrium we talked about

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,560
us how disequilibrium outcomes resolve

123
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,280
themselves through Market adjustments

124
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,199
well here this disequilibrium outcome

125
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,919
cannot resolve itself the market can't

126
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,720
adjust the Market's stuck because of the

127
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,360
regulation so we end up in a situation

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,720
we're out of equilibrium we have excess

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,120
Supply okay in in in layman's terms we

130
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,840
call that

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,919
unemployment we end up with unemployment

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,960
we end up with people who want to work

133
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,240
but can't

134
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,039
work okay and that causes an

135
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,479
inefficiency or dead weight loss you see

136
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,280
before the

137
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,240
policy worker

138
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,319
Surplus okay was um or I'm sorry firm

139
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,720
Surplus I'm sorry for the policy firm

140
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,319
Surplus cuz firms the consumers here was

141
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,360
a plus b plus C that was the consumer

142
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
surplus or in this case consumers are

143
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,880
firms they really call that more the

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,440
demander Surplus the supplier Surplus

145
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,800
was D plus e with the minimum wage we've

146
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:19,319
now transferred the area

147
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,639
B from firms to workers so the firm

148
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,520
Surplus this the demander Surplus has

149
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,039
fallen all the way to

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,680
a so we've transferred the area B but

151
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
we've created in doing so a dead weight

152
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,000
loss of C plus a

153
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,840
standard kind of welfare analys we've

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,120
done so several times before now okay so

155
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,080
what we've done with this policy is

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,560
we've transferred the area

157
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,599
B from the demanders who are firms to

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,120
the suppliers who are workers but in

159
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,400
doing so we've created a deadweight loss

160
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,680
C plus e why because those are trades

161
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,039
that would be efficient to make they're

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,440
not being made there are workers that

163
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,840
would happily

164
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,680
work at a wage below 50 and firms would

165
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,319
be happy to H them at a wage below 50

166
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
but we're not letting that transaction

167
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,199
happen that's wasted economic efficiency

168
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,440
or dead weight

169
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,919
loss this is the pretty standard an of

170
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,080
minimum wage and this says that well

171
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,960
look when you put a minimum wage you get

172
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,759
a

173
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,039
trade-off you get a transfer to workers

174
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,599
which you may like but you create a dead

175
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,400
weight loss because you create

176
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,000
unemployment but actually starting about

177
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,560
30 years ago research started finding

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,360
that minimum wages didn't cause

179
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,879
unemployment actually some research

180
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
studies suggest you put a minimum wage

181
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,039
employment goes

182
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,360
up but certainly there was very little

183
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,400
evidence that goes

184
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,879
down this was quite striking because how

185
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,159
could that happen now one way it could

186
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:56,479
happen of course could be if the demand

187
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,680
curve was perfectly

188
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,159
inelastic then a minimum wage would not

189
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,879
lower employment

190
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,080
you can see that in this graph it's I

191
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,199
haven't drawn this out but you see the

192
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,000
162 imagine taking that blue line and

193
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,599
making it vertical you'll see the

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,840
minimum wage wouldn't cause unemployment

195
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,280
so one thing that could be going on is

196
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,680
demand could be perfectly in elastic but

197
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,440
in fact there's lots of studies which

198
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,599
say that's not true demand for labor is

199
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,159
not perfectly in elastic so that can't

200
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:21,919
be the explanation so we said an

201
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:25,879
alternative explanation which is that

202
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,400
just like Goods markets can be

203
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,720
non-competitive labor markets can also

204
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,000
be non-competitive

205
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,279
and so we think the explanation is

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
non-competitive labor

207
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,800
markets okay so when we when we thought

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,399
about firms selling Goods we said look

209
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,959
at a competitive market firms face

210
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,560
perfectly elastic demand any given firm

211
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,080
faces perfectly elastic

212
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,839
demand okay well

213
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,519
likewise when we think about a firm

214
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,120
hiring workers we think that in a we if

215
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,920
labor markets are competitive

216
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,760
any given firm faed a perfectly elastic

217
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,839
supply curve think about the intuition

218
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,399
the interest perfectly competitive

219
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,000
market is look if I'm selling chachis

220
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,519
next to the other guy selling

221
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,600
chachis then I can't raise my price

222
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,399
above or below his because if I raise it

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
above I'll sell zero below I'll sell I

224
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,680
won't I won't be able to meet

225
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
demand well it's the same thing when

226
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,920
hiring workers a perfectly competitive

227
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,320
market imagine a perfectly competitive

228
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,880
labor market which is fast food

229
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,680
workers okay there's a bunch of fast

230
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,399
food restaurants near each other if

231
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,720
McDonald's pays 50 cents more than

232
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,240
Burger King everyone leaves Burger King

233
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,120
and works at McDonald's if Burger King

234
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,519
pays 50 cents more than McDonald's vice

235
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,079
versa so you have essentially each firm

236
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,760
faces a flat supply curve because

237
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,640
workers can just move it's an easy

238
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,040
substitution between them just like it's

239
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,360
EAS a substitute between statues of the

240
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,680
eiel tower little mini statues it's easy

241
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,720
substitute between working mcdonal and

242
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,160
Burger King it's the same job and

243
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,680
they're near each

244
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,399
other okay however

245
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,640
what we've realized is that may in fact

246
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,079
not be

247
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,760
true what if just like Goods markets can

248
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,920
be

249
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,320
non-competitive what if labor markets

250
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,519
can be

251
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
non-competitive remember the assumptions

252
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,760
we required for a perfectly competitive

253
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,880
Goods Market we required perfect

254
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,480
information and no transaction costs and

255
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,000
all Goods being the same well for a

256
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,920
perfectly competitive labor market the

257
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,640
same requirements are in place

258
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,279
you need perfect

259
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,320
information you need no transaction

260
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,839
costs and all jobs to be the same well

261
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,720
that's not true in particular the first

262
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,720
isn't true we don't have perfect

263
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,399
information because jobs don't always

264
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,639
post their wages typically don't post

265
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,760
their wages and typically you don't know

266
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,200
what you can make in another

267
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,360
firm okay once you don't know what you

268
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,839
can make in another firm once it's

269
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,839
costly to learn that that's a

270
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,839
transaction cost that interferes

271
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,399
okay that's one form of transaction

272
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,440
costs that could interfere what we think

273
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,440
is a fairly competitive

274
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,360
market okay now let's go further let's

275
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,240
think about the most extreme case which

276
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,279
was the old mining towns we used to have

277
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,440
in the West in the US in the US the way

278
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,480
it work is you discovered gold you'd set

279
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,240
up a town to around the gold mine and

280
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,920
everyone in that town would work in the

281
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,279
gold mine or they would work selling

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,880
stuff to worked in the gold mine okay

283
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,440
well in that case you definitely didn't

284
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,079
face a competitive labor market because

285
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,480
that was the only place to work there

286
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,800
was one employer the gold

287
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,880
mine and they had and if you want to

288
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,760
work you had to work for that one

289
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:47,720
employer so instead of the case of a

290
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:50,279
monopoly we had a case of a

291
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,880
monopsony a monopsony a

292
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:56,200
monopoly is when only one firm sells the

293
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,600
good a

294
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,240
monopsony is when only one firm hires

295
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,240
the workers

296
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,600
okay let's suppose further let's just s

297
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,279
is having a bunch of Gold Mine Workers

298
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,839
let's suppose further that just as we

299
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,839
assume initially the monopolies can't

300
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,839
price

301
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,920
discriminate let's assume monopsonies

302
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,399
can't wage discriminate this is actually

303
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,639
kind of a more reasonable assumption it

304
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,880
was always sort of weird to say why

305
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,839
could monopolis charge different people

306
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,560
different prices it's a more reasonable

307
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,440
sub to think firms can't pay similar

308
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,920
worker different way wages they'd be

309
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,079
pissed right it's sort of you know if if

310
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,040
if you're paying two Works doing the

311
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,519
same job different wages they're going

312
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,760
to get upset people care about Equity

313
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,000
it's sort of more reasonable think for

314
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,040
the same job you sort of have to pay the

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,839
same wage I think that's a much sort of

316
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,199
more reasonable assumption than it is a

317
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,720
monopoly

318
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:51,160
case okay I mean you can pay managers

319
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,279
more than M workers but it's sort of

320
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,279
reasonable to think you kind of have to

321
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:58,800
pay all the M workers the same

322
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:00,199
thing what that means is that just as

323
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,120
when you're a

324
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,880
monopoly lowering your price might hurt

325
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,600
your profits through the poisoning

326
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,680
effect when your M

327
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,279
monopsony raising the wage will hurt

328
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,440
your profits through an equivalent

329
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,240
poisoning

330
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,839
effect so let's think about the firm's

331
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,760
decision okay the firm wants to set the

332
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,920
marginal cost of the next worker equal

333
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,639
to the marginal benefit of the next

334
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,480
worker okay what is the marginal

335
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,920
benefit well the marginal benefit is

336
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,560
still the marginal revenue product of

337
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,880
labor that hasn't changed that's true

338
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,440
regardless of the market the next worker

339
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,240
produces the next marginal revenue

340
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,000
produc the marginal product of labor

341
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,440
what changes the marginal

342
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,519
cost before the marginal cost was the

343
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,959
wage in a perfectly competitive labor

344
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,880
market I didn't say last time I was

345
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,720
assuming that but I was in a perfectly

346
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,480
competitive labor market the wage is the

347
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,920
cost but in a monop market that's no

348
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,720
longer true and to see that want to say

349
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,000
what's the marginal cost the mar cost is

350
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,399
the marginal expenditure to get another

351
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,680
unit of

352
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,639
Labor well what's the expenditure to get

353
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,199
another unit of Labor your expenditure

354
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,120
is your what's your total what's your

355
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,399
total wage Bill I'm sorry what's your

356
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,759
total wage bill it's the wage you pay by

357
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,959
times the number of workers you have but

358
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,079
the number of workers you have is a

359
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:22,160
function of the wage you pay right the

360
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,920
more you pay the more workers will kind

361
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,040
of want to work with you so if we

362
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,120
differentiate this and get marginal

363
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,360
expenditure which is sort of the firm's

364
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,639
marginal cost of hiring another unit of

365
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:42,000
Labor the marginal

366
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:42,000
expenditure is W plus DW DL time

367
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,519
l in other

368
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,759
words it's this term which is positive

369
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,560
the marginal expenditure is the wage

370
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,079
plus this second term which is how much

371
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,959
do you have to raise the wage to get

372
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:03,279
another worker

373
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:06,000
it's a flip side of the poisoning effect

374
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,040
the poisoning effect was as a monopolist

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,279
if I want to sell one more unit I face a

376
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,560
tradeoff I sell the additional unit

377
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,639
that's good but I have to lower my price

378
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,320
to sell it that's bad here if I want to

379
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,800
hire one more unit of Labor there's an

380
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,440
equivalent tradeoff I get one more

381
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,839
worker that's

382
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:29,079
good but I have to pay all my workers

383
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,240
more to get him that's bad

384
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:33,240
why because I can't wage

385
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,399
discriminate and it sort of makes sense

386
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,519
if I want to expand the number of it's I

387
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,120
once again I think it's much more intive

388
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,680
the Monopoly case if I want more workers

389
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,880
I got to raise the

390
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,680
wage okay why was this not an issue for

391
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,720
the perfectly competitive firm it's not

392
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,399
an issue firm because they faced a

393
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,120
perfectly elastic firm labor supply

394
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,199
curve workers were different McDonald's

395
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,560
and Burger King so they could just go

396
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,680
back and forth but a a monopsonist

397
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,440
doesn't face that anymore they face the

398
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,800
true market labor supply curve which is

399
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,040
not perfectly elastic so to see this

400
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,800
let's go to figure 164 so

401
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,079
163 that's a perfectly competitive

402
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
case the marginal benefit of hiring

403
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,959
another worker is the marginal revenue

404
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,199
product of labor 163 the marginal

405
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
benefit the marginal revenue product of

406
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:22,680
labor the marginal cost is expressed by

407
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,600
the wage which is determined by a

408
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,959
perfectly competitive

409
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,360
market but 164 is a mopsy now we have

410
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,279
the same marginal revenue product of

411
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,440
labor which we defined as 70 minus L we

412
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:38,120
use the same example did before 70 minus

413
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,720
L uh well we're flipping this so the

414
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,920
marginal so now we can write the

415
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
marginal revenue product of labor curve

416
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,160
as simply W equal 70 minus l so just

417
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,160
inverting

418
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,680
that okay that's that's the firm's

419
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,399
demand curve or margin product of labor

420
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,519
curve but what about its marginal

421
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,480
expenditure curve well if you look at

422
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:08,199
the supply curve the supply curve was w

423
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,280
= l + 10 right so we can now say expend

424
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,480
the firm's expenditure

425
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,079
function labor is W I'm sorry uh the

426
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,280
firm's expenditure

427
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:22,039
function is L time L + 10 that's its

428
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,959
labor expenditures right stare at that

429
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,199
for a minute the number of workers times

430
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,360
the wage the wage comes from this

431
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,200
equation differentiate that with respect

432
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,679
to L and what do you

433
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,600
get if you different if you differ

434
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:41,240
respect to L you get that you get two

435
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,120
you get uh 2 L +

436
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,160
10 and that is the firm's marginal

437
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,160
expenditure

438
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,280
curve which is

439
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,200
above the F the supply curve as you see

440
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,720
in figure

441
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,760
164 so what does a monopsonist do the

442
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,520
monopsonist set

443
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
goes to the point where marginal cost

444
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,360
equals marginal benefits what's the

445
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,520
marginal cost the marginal cost is the

446
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,039
marginal expenditure curve what's the

447
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,240
marginal benefit the marginal revenue

448
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:14,440
product curve so it says I want to hire

449
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,880
20

450
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,840
workers not the 30 I was hiring in the

451
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,960
market was competitive but

452
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,200
20 what wage am I going to pay them well

453
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,159
just like the monopolist needs to

454
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,280
respect the demand curve the monopsonist

455
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,400
needs to respect the supply curve so

456
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
ways you can pay them when we read off

457
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,159
the supply curve you're going to pay

458
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,360
them 30 instead of

459
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,880
40 so what's going on here you're hiring

460
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,280
fewer workers at a lower

461
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,320
wage than the equilibrium would dictate

462
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,280
why because if you want more workers you

463
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,679
got to raise the wage and that's not

464
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,200
profitable so if you're if you're at the

465
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:57,000
point where you're paying 30 to get 20

466
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,520
workers and from that point you want to

467
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,760
hire more workers say well look you know

468
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,280
even at that point it's you know I'm

469
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,320
making money on the next

470
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,600
worker but the problem is to hire that

471
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,360
next work you have to pay higher wages

472
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,760
to all your previous workers and it's

473
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,240
not worth it this is a hard intuition

474
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,600
but it's the flip side of the poisoning

475
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,320
intuition so go back to your Monopoly

476
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,679
case and work it through you'll see it's

477
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,679
all just the

478
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,039
opposite okay now while I need to teach

479
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
you the math and the graphs because

480
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,039
that's what we test you on the intuition

481
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,919
here is actually pretty clear I think

482
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,559
clearer than the Monopoly case just

483
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,799
think about the intuition for a second

484
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,000
think about me at

485
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,960
MIT there's many universities I could

486
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,159
work for okay I mean it sound arrogant

487
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,799
but there's a lot of universities out

488
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,840
there presumably some others would want

489
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:50,480
to hire me

490
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:55,360
okay yet MIT has monopsony power over me

491
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,360
why what gives MIT monopsony power over

492
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,919
me it's nothing nefarious think about

493
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,760
typically any but any firm has Monopoly

494
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,760
power over their employees

495
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,039
why well

496
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,320
yeah I don't know how much I get paid

497
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,799
anywhere else that's one reason so

498
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,240
there's an information

499
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,559
reason what else now let's actually

500
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,440
let's compare that actually I know how

501
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,000
to get paid in California because

502
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,600
California public schools have to make

503
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,760
their wages public so let's say I could

504
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,799
overcome that actually if you go online

505
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,400
you want know when it's paid at a public

506
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,919
university in America you can figure

507
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,679
that out okay so let's say I could solve

508
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,039
that problem but there's other reasons

509
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,039
why MIT is monop power let's say if they

510
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,039
mov to California

511
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,400
yeah well I'm established I I have to

512
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,360
 move right like if I want to go

513
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,679
to California I gotta move that sucks I

514
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,520
gotta pack up the house I got to leave

515
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,640
all my friends uh in particular my wife

516
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,799
might have a job that she likes here my

517
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,679
kids might like being in school here so

518
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,760
there's a huge transaction cost

519
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,240
transaction costs create monopsony power

520
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,360
it's not a mining town me it's not a

521
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,559
mining town but it still has Market

522
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,000
power over me because of transaction

523
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:10,480
costs do also the fact I like teaching

524
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
MIT I've got my lecture set the to some

525
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,720
other univers I have to dumb them down

526
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,240
because the students aren't as smart as

527
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,039
MIT I don't want to do that I've got I

528
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,840
my office has a window view it's pretty

529
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,679
awesome my window has an has a river

530
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,360
view my office has a window view Jesus

531
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,799
my my office has a Riverview through the

532
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,080
window okay that's pretty awesome that'

533
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,880
be hard to replicate a lot of other

534
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,679
universities

535
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,480
basically every job change in jobs comes

536
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,600
with transaction costs transaction costs

537
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,840
create monopsony power MIT does not have

538
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,400
to pay me the market

539
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,760
wage because of these transaction costs

540
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,120
and because of information

541
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,559
limitations okay so it's not crazy to

542
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,039
think indeed we now think that basically

543
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,559
monopsony is a better description of

544
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,480
almost all labor markets than is perfect

545
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,679
competition this is a real SE change in

546
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,640
the last 20 years is a real sort of

547
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,960
takeover the monop city model in labor

548
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,520
economics that we think it's probably

549
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,440
much more likely if firms have monopsony

550
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,880
power than that they're perfectly

551
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,880
competitive okay

552
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,360
yeah in the new higher market so that's

553
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,000
a great Point there's still the

554
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,120
information issue which is I'd have to

555
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,600
go and collect a bunch of offers but

556
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,120
other than that you're right you would

557
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,960
think and indeed if you look at salaries

558
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,600
of

559
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,400
academics new higher salaries if you

560
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,960
look at Sal academics you can basically

561
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,760
predict them pretty well based on two

562
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,960
based on essentially when do they get

563
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,679
their last offer so new higher salaries

564
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,799
are pretty flat and you'll get raises

565
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,159
when they get an offer from another

566
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,520
University so basically MIT will

567
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,720
underpay you until you get an offer from

568
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,120
another University and then they'll then

569
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,919
they'll because that reveals information

570
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,799
and then MIT can then can then do that

571
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,039
okay good question all right now what

572
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:07,240
does this mean for the government well

573
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:08,720
this means that there is scope for gains

574
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,559
from regulation because look this

575
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,400
monopis has created a dead weight loss

576
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,799
look at the we we off have 30 workers so

577
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,919
a deadweight loss triangle from only

578
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,080
hiring 20 workers that says their scope

579
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,279
for optimal regulation just like the

580
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,080
scope to Optimal regulation of monop of

581
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,760
monopolis and what would optimal

582
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,880
regulation look like well it could look

583
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:33,640
like a minimum wage so imagine if figure

584
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,520
165 we set a minimum wage equal to the

585
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,000
market

586
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:41,200
wage well now think about the firm's

587
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,279
decision for any workers to the left of

588
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,919
LM there's no poisoning effect because

589
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,760
they can't lower the wage so they might

590
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,000
as well higher the competitive level

591
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,840
what has the minimum wage just done it

592
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,960
has raised

593
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,039
employment so this is how you can get

594
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,080
this weird result that a minimum wage

595
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,480
can raise employment because what the

596
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,640
minimum wage has done has essentially

597
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,080
eroded monopsony power or eroded the

598
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,279
negative effects of monopsony by getting

599
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,559
rid of this poisoning effect by saying

600
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,760
well firms might as well hire Elm the

601
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,120
reason they were hiring lower than El

602
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,480
comp before was because they could lower

603
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,720
the wage but now they

604
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,400
can't so that is how a minimum wage can

605
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,279
raise employment now of course so in

606
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,720
subsets you can get a win-win government

607
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:29,480
policy you can transfer Surplus to

608
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,279
Consumers and raise employment everybody

609
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,640
wins and that's how government policy

610
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
can make things better in imperfect Mark

611
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,399
with market

612
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,440
failures now of course that isn't

613
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:40,520
necessarily

614
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,880
true what would happen if you set the

615
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,080
minimum wage well let me ask first what

616
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,520
happen if you set the minimum wage too

617
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,360
low what if you set the minimum wage

618
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,279
below

619
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,320
W1 what would happen if the government

620
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:58,399
put a minimum wage in was below

621
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,559
W1 yeah no effect very important the

622
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:01,480
private Market will always get around

623
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,880
government regulations if it can a

624
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,840
government regulation that doesn't bind

625
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,399
is no government regulation at all it

626
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,320
sounds obvious but it's not it's

627
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:09,360
important to remember the first thing

628
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,640
after to go regulations is do they

629
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,279
matter okay then basically as you think

630
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,880
about any minimum wage between

631
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:22,480
W1 and even past W comp they will

632
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,000
actually improve welfare but as it gets

633
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,960
high enough the minimum wage could

634
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,919
actually and cause firms once the

635
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,480
minimum wage gets above

636
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,880
um the level on the marginal revenue

637
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,640
product curve that corresponds to L1 so

638
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,200
you see where the L1 dash line hits the

639
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,799
marginal revenue product curve once the

640
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,399
wage gets above that level then you're

641
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,840
making things worse you end up hiring

642
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:48,520
fewer workers then the monopus would

643
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,919
hire so once again the way to think

644
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,760
government regulation once again come

645
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,679
take 1441 we'll spend all semester on

646
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,720
this the way to think about it is the

647
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,880
market knows best unless there's a

648
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,159
market failure the market failure raises

649
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,559
the PO potential for the government to

650
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,799
improve things but doesn't prove

651
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,600
government will Pro improve things it

652
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,960
does not prove government will improve

653
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,320
things you need to actually study and

654
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,240
examine the government policy to see if

655
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,279
it makes it better or worse for minimum

656
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,080
wages basically the consensus now is for

657
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,559
minimum wages in the range that minimum

658
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,159
wages are set in America which is being

659
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,799
probably about $8 and12 an hour okay

660
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,520
where most minimum wages are we the

661
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,679
consensus seems to be that they are a

662
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,760
good thing that basically they can cause

663
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,200
benefits to workers without actually

664
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,919
reducing employment once you get above

665
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,600
12 the evidence gets more mixed so we

666
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,880
now are seeing a series of 15-hour wage

667
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,799
dollar minimum wage including

668
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,320
Massachusetts the evidence on those is a

669
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,520
little more mixed we need a little more

670
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,000
time to study but there's some level at

671
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,600
which a minimum wage definitionally is

672
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
high enough it will cause unemployment

673
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,360
that doesn't mean minum wage is bad it

674
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,960
just means at that point there's a

675
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,399
trade-off so if you go back to figure 16

676
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,159
um

677
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:01,399
two 162 does not imply we should not

678
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,279
have minimum

679
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:07,520
wage 162 just says there is a tradeoff

680
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,760
you lose efficiency but you redistribute

681
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,520
to

682
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,240
workers okay in a standard model that's

683
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,279
bad because we rate consumer and

684
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,559
producer Surplus the same but in the

685
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,919
real world it might not be we might

686
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,120
value consumer surplus more than

687
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,520
producer

688
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,960
Surplus so the bottom line is the

689
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,200
minimum wage isn't in no situation is it

690
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,080
unambiguously bad it may actually be

691
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,760
unambiguously good and depends on the

692
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,360
structure of the labor

693
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:40,320
market okay questions about

694
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,799
that so once again the idea would be MIT

695
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,600
is making excess money off me because I

696
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,320
don't want to move if the government

697
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,640
came in and raised my wages not too much

698
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,679
that would make me better off and it

699
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,880
would just come out of mit's profits it

700
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,279
would just be a

701
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,000
transfer but I'd be better off and they

702
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,320
would they'd maybe because they pay

703
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,200
higher wage they may hire another

704
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,679
another professor okay and that would

705
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,600
improve efficiency all right so with

706
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,880
with monopsonist minimum wage is just

707
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,360
induce efficient

708
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,519
transfers now that's all I want to say

709
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,559
about Labor markets I want to turn now

710
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,080
to Capital markets which are a degree

711
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,279
more complicated and therefore a degree

712
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,279
more

713
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,080
interesting the main reason they're

714
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,519
complicated is that

715
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,159
capital is not tangible the way labor is

716
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,559
labor you feel it you've done it it's an

717
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,159
hour of work you know what work is

718
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,640
capital what is it it's machines it's

719
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:39,240
buildings it's vague

720
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,559
thing so we're going to Now define

721
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,559
capital more

722
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,480
specifically by think about where

723
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,360
Capital comes

724
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:52,600
from where does the money come from to

725
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,000
buy machines to finally to invest what

726
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,440
goes all the way back to our farming

727
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,480
agricultural

728
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,679
economy farmers every year face a

729
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,399
decision are they going to

730
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,760
consume all of their crop or are they

731
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,919
going to save some of the some of it to

732
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,679
plant to create next year's

733
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:15,120
crop so farmers face a decision of

734
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,720
diverting today's consumption to

735
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,760
tomorrow's consumption or next year's

736
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,600
consumption how much of today's

737
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,120
consumption they want to give up how

738
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,519
much less they want to eat this year to

739
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,320
have more to eat next year and that

740
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,360
determines how many seeds they want to

741
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,120
set

742
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,640
aside that's what capital

743
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,279
is capital is

744
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,760
essentially what you take from

745
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,240
today to have in the future when you buy

746
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,120
a machine you are spending money today

747
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,279
to get the machine so over the next few

748
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,640
years it produces stuff that's no

749
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,240
different than saving your

750
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,919
seeds Okay that's what capital is is

751
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,640
essentially the diversion of current

752
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,799
consumption towards future

753
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:04,480
consumption now unlike the

754
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,679
farmer firms today don't get the money

755
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,760
necessarily from themselves like the

756
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,559
farmers did firms get their capital in

757
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,080
what's called a capital Market well I

758
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,480
just wrote that there firms get their

759
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,919
capital in a capital Market what is the

760
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,760
capital Market well that's a market with

761
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,399
his demand for

762
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,720
Capital which comes from how much which

763
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,679
I'll derve in a few minutes comes from

764
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,640
how much firms value the capital and a

765
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,240
supply of capital well where does supply

766
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,000
of capital come from what is capital

767
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,960
it's basically the money you

768
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,679
use to invest in the future where does

769
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,679
it come from it comes from us the supply

770
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,399
of capital is

771
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:46,519
savings so the money firms use to buy

772
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:49,399
their machines they borrow from

773
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:53,399
people and that is how the Capital

774
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,960
Market works so we talk about Capital we

775
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,799
really think of it fundamentally as

776
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,519
Financial Capital don't think of it

777
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,720
anymore as machines and buildings think

778
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,919
of it as Financial Capital the money you

779
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,679
want to

780
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,279
invest to divert today's consumption

781
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,120
Mars consumption it comes from the

782
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,519
savings that we do which is our decision

783
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,519
to divert today's consumption to

784
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,480
tomorrow's

785
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:23,799
consumption okay so just

786
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:26,760
as work just as workers decide how hard

787
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:30,960
to work and that drives the supply of

788
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,720
labor people decide how much to save and

789
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:38,279
that drives the supply of capital so

790
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:41,799
let's see that in figure

791
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,919
166 figure 166 is the capital market

792
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:48,840
equilibrium the demand for

793
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:50,360
Capital comes from the marginal revenue

794
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,600
product of

795
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,039
capital just like the demand for labor

796
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,240
comes the margin Revenue product of

797
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,519
labor the demand for Capital comes the

798
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,320
margin Revenue product of capital

799
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,559
how much will the next unit of capital

800
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,519
the next unit of financial investment

801
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,960
what will it yield in terms of the value

802
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,039
of what I'll

803
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,399
produce how much will the next machine

804
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,159
increase the quantity of goods and what

805
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:17,840
can I sell those goods for so the same

806
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:21,559
logic that applies to labor applies to

807
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,559
Capital the supply of capital comes from

808
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:26,840
workers

809
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,840
saving why do workers save they save

810
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,919
because they can get a return to that

811
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,919
saving in the form of

812
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:37,080
Interest I is the rate of interest

813
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,480
that's the return that workers get on

814
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,559
their savings so in other words you

815
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,200
could think of I the technical defition

816
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,679
of the interest rate is the rate that

817
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,320
firms have to pay you to get your

818
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,960
money I is the rate that firms have to

819
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,559
pay Savers to get them to

820
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,760
save okay so for example if the interest

821
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,120
rate is 10%

822
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,039
then if a house if I want to borrow a

823
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,639
dollar from a household this period I

824
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:08,679
have to pay them back a11 next

825
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:10,880
period let me by the way one

826
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,600
parenthetical comment time is a very

827
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,799
elastic Concept in this class man don't

828
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,399
be uptight in your thinking like the

829
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,480
dude says okay basically time sometimes

830
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:21,200
I'll say today tomorrow sometimes I'll

831
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,960
say this year next year it's all the

832
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,720
same man just means period one versus

833
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,440
period two so don't get too caught up in

834
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,519
the words I use just think of this as

835
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,799
period one versus period two

836
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,480
okay that's that's the key and I'll try

837
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,039
to use as much as I can but I say today

838
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,320
tomorrow this year next year it's all

839
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,559
the same thing okay so don't do too

840
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,120
caught up on the

841
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:45,919
terminology now basically the idea is

842
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:49,919
that the Su demand curve is downward

843
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:53,600
sloping as the interest rate

844
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,600
Rises firms want less

845
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,559
Capital because why because interest

846
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,320
rate Rising means that the opportunity

847
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,440
cost employing machine has gone up

848
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,840
because what can you do instead with

849
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,480
your money hire a

850
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,679
worker so an up a a downward sloping

851
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,839
demand curve for capital is basically

852
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:18,240
the rate at which firms are going to

853
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:19,839
trade off capital for labor as interest

854
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,480
State goes up they'll say fewer machines

855
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,159
more labor and St goes down they'll say

856
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,520
less labor more

857
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,040
machines the supply curve slopes up

858
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,159
because basically the more you pay

859
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,399
people to save the more they'll

860
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,639
save okay now let me pause for a second

861
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,280
we are we have a whole series of courses

862
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,639
in course 15 about the about Finance I'm

863
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
doing Finance in like a lecture and a

864
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,960
half here okay and if you find this

865
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,800
interesting you take 1541 1542 the whole

866
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,399
series of course you take course 15 by

867
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,040
the way since all of you should really

868
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,639
go be econ Majors you get economics

869
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,079
elective credit for a couple of those

870
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,560
courses you can Eon major and take some

871
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,359
course 15 courses if you want to learn

872
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,640
more more about Finance okay so

873
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,720
basically um but let's just talk about

874
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,640
this weird thing I'm talking about what

875
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,520
does it mean that people loan money to a

876
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,480
firm because we don't really necess loan

877
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,400
money to a firm in fact firms get their

878
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,000
money from people in three different

879
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,640
ways there's three different ways we can

880
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,640
essentially transfer our money to

881
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,440
firms one

882
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,960
way is we could put it in the

883
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,280
bank okay you put your money in the bank

884
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,560
the bank pays you an interest rate

885
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,800
firms then go to the bank and borrow the

886
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,200
money from the bank so we're not direct

887
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,680
leaving the money to the firms we're

888
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,440
doing it through an through a financial

889
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,760
intermediary which is the bank so the

890
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,000
most common way people get money to

891
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,680
firms is by having money in the bank you

892
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,680
don't know that you just think you're

893
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,119
got a bank account yielding whatever but

894
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,520
that's what you're doing you're just

895
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,319
giving money to

896
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,960
firms the second way you can do it is

897
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:56,359
you can actually directly loan the money

898
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,640
to the firm by buying corporate

899
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:02,079
bonds okay a corporate bond is literally

900
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,440
a loan to a firm now typically most of

901
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,800
us who aren't Super Rich won't buy a

902
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,800
corporate bond will buy a financial

903
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,079
instrument that holds corporate bonds

904
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,680
okay so I have a Vanguard bond fund

905
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,560
Vanguard is a company that holds

906
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,000
financial instruments so I own a little

907
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,079
piece of a lot of bonds okay bonds are

908
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,440
like millions of dollars I'm not gonna

909
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,680
own a bond but I own a little piece of a

910
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,760
bunch of them okay so I'm sort of that's

911
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:29,079
the way you directly loan to a firm and

912
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,640
then finally you can buy stocks which is

913
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,920
another way directly probably the most

914
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,839
direct way to give money to a firm you

915
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,119
can only buy a share in a firm you can

916
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,839
go out tomorrow you can buy a share in

917
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,359
apple you get a piece of paper that says

918
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:41,119
you own a share of Apple okay you've

919
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,599
given Apple your money what are they

920
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,359
giving you back they're giving you back

921
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,839
two

922
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:49,480
things the first is they're giving you

923
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:51,880
back the promise that their price of

924
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,160
that stock will go up that if you buy

925
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,440
what Apple stock let's say Apple stock

926
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,119
today selling at 100 I don't know what

927
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,520
selling at okay it's probably much more

928
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,599
than that selling at a 100 if I buy for

929
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,400
100 then what that means I give Apple

930
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:05,520
$100 they give me a share why do I do

931
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,720
that because I think in five years Apple

932
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,040
will be worth

933
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,800
150 and then I could sell that share to

934
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,160
someone else and get my

935
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,920
$50 okay in addition some old style

936
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,480
firms not the new firms old style firms

937
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,000
also sometimes will just send regular

938
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,240
checks to people on their stock called

939
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
dividends that happens less and less but

940
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,640
basically so I can put my money in the

941
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,520
bank the bank pays me Interest the fir

942
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,880
them borrow from the bank I can buy a

943
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,640
corporate bond the bond pays me Interest

944
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,599
okay it's a Rec direct loan or I can buy

945
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,800
stock in which case I give the money to

946
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,760
the firm and they pay me back by getting

947
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,520
more valuable or paying me a dividend

948
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,640
and that's essentially how I transfer

949
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,560
money to firms okay questions about

950
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,920
that

951
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,920
yeah interest

952
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:59,440
rate you relate the interest rate to the

953
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,440
slope I don't quite understand

954
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,920
yeah yeah exactly there's a mathematical

955
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,200
function uh essentially the demand curve

956
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,400
will be a negative function of interest

957
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,000
rates supply curve will be a positive

958
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,079
function of interest rates there's a

959
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,359
mathematical function just like other

960
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,920
demand and Supply

961
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:19,440
curves other

962
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,960
questions okay so

963
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,920
now let's come the demand part is sort

964
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,960
of uninteresting we know how to drive

965
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,520
this what you do is you take a

966
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,240
production function you'd set up a you

967
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,280
you would you would get a cost function

968
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,880
you could solve for the marginal revenue

969
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,880
product of capital okay you know how to

970
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,160
do that the the supply side is more

971
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,079
interesting and why is it more

972
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,839
interesting because once again

973
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,200
substitution income effects are going to

974
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,280
mess things up just like they did for

975
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,000
labor Supply they are going to do it for

976
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,640
savings and they're going to do so in

977
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,560
the framework of what we call

978
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,560
intertemporal

979
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,920
Choice which is your decision of how

980
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:07,000
much do you consume and how much do you

981
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,000
save so to do that let's go to figure

982
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,680
16 figure

983
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,079
167 and this diagram describes the

984
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,920
person's decision of how much to

985
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,960
save okay I'm just G this graphically in

986
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,400
section you're going to do the

987
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,480
math okay

988
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,640
individuals have a utility fun function

989
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,800
we talked about youtility function we

990
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,160
choose between two goods we always do

991
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,680
two element utility function make the

992
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,319
math easy talk about choos two goods we

993
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,280
talked about choos between consumption

994
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:40,200
and Leisure now we're talking about

995
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,400
choosing between consumption in Period

996
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,000
one and consumption in Period

997
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,560
two now the

998
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,760
tradeoff instead of being

999
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,440
between pizza and

1000
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,960
cookies or being

1001
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,960
between or being between work Leisure

1002
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,920
and and consumption now between be

1003
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,319
consuming today versus consuming

1004
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,560
tomorrow and we understand the trade-off

1005
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,160
the trade-off is that basically people

1006
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,440
are by and large

1007
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,440
impatient if you ask them would you

1008
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,599
rather something today or tomorrow

1009
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,839
they'd rather have it today okay there's

1010
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,200
the famous marshmallow test they do on

1011
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,440
little kids where they see if they'll

1012
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,400
wait to get a marshmallow Okay most kids

1013
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,520
don't humans are impatient okay we'll

1014
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,280
come back to that in a few lectures talk

1015
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,200
about how you model that but for now

1016
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,880
let's just say humans are impatient on

1017
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,040
the on the other hand humans need money

1018
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,359
in both periods so let's do a simple

1019
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,319
example imagine my income is $80,000 a

1020
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:42,560
year okay and imagine I I can save that

1021
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:45,160
money at 10% so Y is 80,000 and let's

1022
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,680
imagine I only earn the income well okay

1023
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,560
management income is 8,000 I can save

1024
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,760
that at 10% and next year I want to stay

1025
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,359
home take care of my

1026
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,040
kids I don't want to

1027
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:59,240
work so what that means my my income imp

1028
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,599
Peri period one will be 80,000 but my

1029
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,640
income in Period two will be

1030
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:05,720
zero guess more complicate income in

1031
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,160
Period two you'll see that in the

1032
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,359
problem set okay my Inc in Period two

1033
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,079
would be zero okay now my question is

1034
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,079
what do I do well you could see that in

1035
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,640
figure

1036
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,480
167 one option is figure 167 has my

1037
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,760
first period consumption on the xaxis my

1038
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,760
secondary consumption the y axis one

1039
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,640
option would be to consume everything in

1040
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,920
Year One

1041
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,960
and nothing in year two that's not very

1042
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,240
attractive the other oper consume

1043
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,119
nothing in year one in which case I

1044
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,119
would have 88,000 in year two why

1045
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:43,560
because I would save 80,000 on a 10%

1046
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:46,240
interest so what's the tradeoff the

1047
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,640
tradeoff is the interest

1048
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,119
rate right or in other words what is the

1049
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,920
price of First Period

1050
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:58,240
consumption the price of First Period

1051
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,560
consumption okay is minus

1052
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,960
okay the price for consumption is minus

1053
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,000
1 plus

1054
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,359
I okay the price for once again I assume

1055
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,280
all Goods have a price of one when I

1056
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,680
came to price of goods this is what is

1057
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,760
the relative price of First Period

1058
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,040
consumption okay so assume the price of

1059
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,480
consumption in Period one is one the

1060
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,880
price of consumption in Period two is

1061
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,520
one we're normalizing everything to make

1062
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,160
our math easy throwing prices out okay

1063
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,359
every it's just it's just we're thinking

1064
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,920
in terms of goods effectively here so

1065
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,000
what is the relative price of consuming

1066
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:35,240
in Period one minus 1 plus I why is that

1067
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,160
because for every dollar I consume in

1068
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,400
Period one I give up one plus I dollars

1069
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,520
in Period

1070
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,559
two that is the opportunity cost of

1071
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,400
first period consumption is not having

1072
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:50,359
second period consumption once again

1073
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,400
dismal

1074
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,680
science every time you eat something

1075
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,680
you're giving up the possibility of

1076
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,880
saving that money eating more next year

1077
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,440
okay just like there's a the price of

1078
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,040
leisures the wage the price of First

1079
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,760
Period consumption is minus one plus I

1080
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,599
or the interest rate the amount of money

1081
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,400
you could have the next

1082
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:13,760
year okay so basically that is the

1083
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,839
tradeoff that is representing the

1084
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,559
interal Choice problem that's

1085
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:18,640
represented by the slope of this budget

1086
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,400
constraint which is minus1 plus I or

1087
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,640
minus 1.1 in our example the slope of

1088
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,960
the budget create represents the

1089
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,960
opportunity cost of first period

1090
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,880
consumption in terms of second period

1091
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,400
consumption okay okay likewise I have

1092
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,839
some indifference curve I have some

1093
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,960
indifference curve which represents my

1094
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,880
preferences over first and second period

1095
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,920
consumption how impatient I am basically

1096
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,480
okay so think of the Indi curve

1097
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,960
basically being how impatient I am so

1098
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,400
like with all these optimization

1099
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,960
problems I know what to

1100
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,559
do okay I find the tangency between the

1101
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,400
indifference curve which is essentially

1102
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,359
my impatience period one and two and the

1103
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,440
budget constraint which is the market

1104
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,880
rate at which I can trade off

1105
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,040
consumption period one period two

1106
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,240
remember going all the way back to

1107
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,680
lecture one the idea of opportunity cost

1108
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,040
is kind of like the concept of

1109
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,440
alchemy where I'm not literally turning

1110
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,480
period one consumption into period two

1111
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,599
consumption physically but I'm

1112
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,680
effectively doing it through opportunity

1113
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,160
cost by not consuming in Period one you

1114
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,079
get more in Period two so it's

1115
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,400
essentially alchemy that happens through

1116
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,359
the concept of opportunity cost in this

1117
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,640
case it happens through saving in the

1118
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,800
bank by Saving in the bank I turn a

1119
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,359
dollar today into a1ar 10 tomorrow

1120
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,240
dollar period one into a dollar 10 in

1121
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:32,440
Period

1122
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,599
two okay and that's what's happening

1123
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:39,079
here so my optimal consumption in this

1124
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,760
case is C1 in Period one so what do I do

1125
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:42,559
I say well look given my impatience

1126
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,119
level I want to consume C1 in Period one

1127
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,079
in figure

1128
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,880
167 what that means I'm going to save

1129
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:52,079
80,000 minus

1130
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,400
C1 what does that mean my period two

1131
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,920
consumption is it means my period two

1132
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,359
consumption is going to be the amount I

1133
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,079
saved times one plus the interest

1134
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:06,359
rate so it's going to be 1 plus I times

1135
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,760
80,000 minus

1136
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:12,680
C

1137
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,599
C1 now once again let's remember the

1138
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,119
trick I've done here without mentioning

1139
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,000
it this lecture is supposed to be about

1140
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,400
savings that's the first time I've

1141
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,960
mentioned

1142
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,319
savings why because savings is a

1143
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,880
bad savings is something you just have

1144
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,559
to do to get consumption period too no

1145
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,800
one wants to save this one's even a

1146
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,839
little more realistic for you guys

1147
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,240
although you're probably probably still

1148
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:37,359
frugal people but basically the idea

1149
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,559
savings is not a good thing we don't

1150
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,800
have a model where people it's not a

1151
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:41,960
Scrooge McDuck model where people want

1152
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,520
to swim in their money okay savings is

1153
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,839
not a good thing savings is a is a

1154
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,280
necessary tool to get consumption from

1155
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:51,920
period one to period two it's a bad we

1156
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,160
don't model bads we model Goods so we

1157
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,680
don't model savings we model consumption

1158
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,960
and then we get savings as a residual

1159
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,800
so when you want to solve for savings

1160
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,599
you model consumption and you get

1161
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,200
savings as the residual just like when

1162
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,680
you want to model work you solve for

1163
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,599
leisure and get work as the

1164
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:14,720
residual now let's ask what happens when

1165
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:15,520
the interest rate goes up okay once

1166
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,760
again I'm sorry I don't have time for

1167
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,800
the math here but we'll do it in section

1168
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,400
on Friday let's ask what happens when

1169
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,440
the interest rate goes up will we move

1170
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,920
from bc1 to

1171
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,640
bc2 that has guess what two

1172
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,040
effects on the one hand you get the

1173
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,359
substitution

1174
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,640
effect the substitution effect is the

1175
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:39,160
price of First Period consumption has

1176
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,160
gone up so you want to do less of it

1177
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,319
focus on that remember I'm not talking

1178
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,200
about savings I'm not talking about

1179
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,800
second period consumption the subsid

1180
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,160
income effects are purely in terms of

1181
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,119
first period consumption C1 is what

1182
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,440
you're maximizing over here the price of

1183
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:55,960
First Period consumption is gone up why

1184
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,160
is it gone up because the opportunity

1185
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,440
cost's gone up you can have more in

1186
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,160
Period two by Saving more so the

1187
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,319
substitution effect necessarily says you

1188
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,480
have less period one

1189
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:08,839
consumption but what about the income

1190
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,800
effect well consumption in Period two is

1191
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,599
a normal

1192
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,160
good I'm sorry consumption sorry

1193
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,359
consumption period one is a normal good

1194
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,960
cons period one is a normal good and are

1195
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:20,480
you richer or

1196
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:25,520
poor if the rate goes

1197
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:28,200
up are you effectively richer or poor

1198
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,319
effectively go ahead you know richer

1199
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,359
you're effectively richer because every

1200
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:33,760
dollar of savings yields more

1201
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,200
money so the income effect says since

1202
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,880
you're richer you want more of

1203
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,319
everything what's one of the things you

1204
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,880
want more of

1205
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,000
C1 so the income effect goes the other

1206
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,000
way you get the same sort of GIF and

1207
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,079
good effects without

1208
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,079
weirdness so actually whether a higher

1209
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,119
interest rate raised or low and saving

1210
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,559
is ambiguous once again think of the

1211
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,000
intuition it's even easier intuition

1212
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,400
here you're a kid you want a bike the

1213
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,520
bike's going to cost 200 bucks you can

1214
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,079
earn 10 bucks an hour so you work 20

1215
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,559
hours to get the bike then you quit well

1216
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:06,559
if you earn 15 bucks an hour you work

1217
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,240
few hours because all you want is the

1218
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,920
bike that would be a that would be a

1219
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,480
downward sloping supply curve in that

1220
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,280
case the interest rate rise would cause

1221
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,079
you I'm not working I'm sorry let me

1222
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,160
back up I did working going too fast

1223
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,720
here you want a bike it's 200 bucks so

1224
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,119
you got to save

1225
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,280
$200 um you got to save $200 so if the

1226
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,520
interest rate is

1227
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,960
% then you have to save say you know one

1228
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:37,280
you know uh you know 180 roughly this

1229
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,920
year okay to get the bike next year this

1230
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,359
rate 20% you'll have to save about 160

1231
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,640
this year to get the bike next year okay

1232
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:46,000
that's a b forget my old example I was

1233
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,760
on labor so if you want the bike next

1234
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,359
year for 200 bucks and this rates 10%

1235
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,799
you got to save 180 but 20% you got to

1236
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,960
save 160 so you're actually savings goes

1237
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:55,799
down a higher interest rate causes

1238
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,000
savings to go down that would be a

1239
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:01,079
downward sloping supply curve so just

1240
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,400
like labor Supply we don't know which

1241
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,119
way the capital supply curve goes and

1242
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,760
here unfortunately like unfortunately

1243
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,000
unlike labor Supply we don't even have

1244
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,680
good evidence we pretty much know that

1245
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,640
labor Supply curves slope up but are

1246
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,119
almost

1247
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,480
vertical with with capital Supply curves

1248
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,920
we actually don't

1249
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,359
know it's a real empirical weakness in

1250
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,680
economics so we are going to go ahead

1251
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,160
and assume substitution effects Dominate

1252
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,160
and generally draw upward slope opening

1253
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,680
Capital Supply Curves in this course but

1254
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,480
unfortunately we don't really know what

1255
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,920
the capital supply curve looks like okay

1256
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,720
I will stop there and we'll come back uh

1257
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,839
next time and just continue discussing

1258
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,440
we'll discuss how you should invest your

1259
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,040
money so come back next time and learn

1260
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,040
how you should invest your money
