1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,759
good morning good afternoon welcome to

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,320
lecture

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,800
six um today we will be um finishing up

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,640
our discussion of summations that

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,840
binmore started for us last time and

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,599
then moving on to uh asymptotic notation

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,240
which is one of the bread and butter

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,120
topics of algorithm analysis it's a

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,079
really useful uh language and

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,079
terminology that we can use to talk

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,559
about algorithms and compare algorithms

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,239
without getting bogged down in all the

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,920
details but before we do that let's talk

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,239
about sums and before we do that let's

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,960
play with

16
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,840
blocks um so here is a very cool

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,520
question I have a stack of blocks you

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,399
could imagine it's even taller than this

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,559
I just grabbed six for now um and what I

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,280
want to do is sort of lean them out over

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,079
the table and well okay don't want them

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,320
to fall that's that's Criterion one what

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,880
I'm hoping for is to get this top block

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,000
all the way off of this table um so none

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,040
of the block is over the table so

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,080
currently I'm not quite there we can see

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:23,040
there's like an inch half an inch left

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:25,720
um so seems possible maybe um so the

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
rules are we can only have one block per

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,479
layer we can't double up we can't do

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,159
weird angles and whatnot it's just slide

32
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,240
these left and right until you're happy

33
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,680
and hopefully it doesn't fall um are we

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,240
clear on the game nice who thinks it's

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,560
possible raise your hand who thinks it's

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,520
not

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,759
possible all right well let's try

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,320
hopefully I don't hurt myself um all

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,479
right so I'm going to follow a nice

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,719
greedy strategy so I'm going to start

41
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,320
from the top and then I'm just going to

42
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,600
keep sliding left as much as I can until

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,520
it's about to fall over so if I go past

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,280
the center of mass it's going to fall

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,320
over so I'm going to go right up until

46
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,360
that edge and stop and don't worry about

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,520
the physics we're not here to talk about

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,440
physics um but I'm going to do the same

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,599
so let's freeze the top two layers and

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,120
try again let's slide this over until

51
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,000
it's just about to fall it feels right

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,840
around there all right let's keep

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,319
going all

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,680
right yep okay it leaned a little bit

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,560
I'm getting worried but we'll make it

56
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,360
work let's see uh

57
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,959
yeah okay and I think I might already be

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,200
off the table which was my goal but

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,200
let's let's go a little further why not

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,560
uh yes okay and

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,519
finally right around okay that's as far

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,519
as I'm willing to go I

63
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:59,360
think that is off the

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,360
table it's possible yes thank you

65
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,879
I cheated I put little marks on the back

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,799
so I knew how far to

67
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,159
go um but it is possible and now we can

68
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,640
raise the question how far can we go can

69
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,799
we get two lengths out here's what that

70
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,080
would look like two lengths out can we

71
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,560
get five lengths out 10 lengths out

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,879
let's stop at 10 who thinks we can get

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,000
10 lengths out over the table who thinks

74
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,920
10 is possible who thinks 10 is not

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,159
possible all right you're both right

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,280
um I'll explain why in a second uh let's

77
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,720
not have an accident during lecture

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,439
there we go so turns out I'm not going

79
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,319
to prove this now but turns out that

80
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,760
greedy strategy I just used is the best

81
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,080
you can do uh it's not too hard to prove

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,840
it's in the textbook if you're curious

83
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,000
um but let me tell you what that greedy

84
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,599
strategy ends up looking like um if I

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,720
have some chalk here we

86
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,959
go so as you might imagine this first

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,879
block sticks out half a unit over the

88
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,200
next block so its Center of mass is

89
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,879
right here on the edge um by the way I'm

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,439
I'm imagining these blocks are one unit

91
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,439
wide um the next one right here that's a

92
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,160
quarter unit because that's what it

93
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,040
takes to put the center of mass of these

94
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,959
two blocks combined right over the edge

95
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,120
of the third block turns out this right

96
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,440
here is a sixth this right here is an

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,039
eighth and all the way down until the

98
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,720
very n until the the it is the the very

99
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:36,120
n the nth

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:40,160
block has a gap of 1 over 2 N so this is

101
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,560
block 1 2 3 four five all the way to n

102
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
turns out this is the best you can do

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,680
which means the distance you can get

104
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,680
with n

105
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,360
blocks is 12 plus a 4 plus a 6 up to 1

106
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,120
over 2

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,080
N which let's factor out the 1/2 just

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,280
because that's cleaner that's the sum K

109
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,759
= 1 to n of 1 over

110
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,080
K this is also known as 1 12

111
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,080
time the N harmonic

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
number

113
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,639
harmonic

114
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,800
number this is a standard name for this

115
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,000
sum 1 plus a half plus a thir plus a 4th

116
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,360
up to 1/

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,880
n um and half of that is exactly as far

118
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,600
as we can get with n

119
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,080
blocks right so now the question is how

120
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
how big does this get if I have a

121
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,319
thousand blocks how far can I get if I

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
have a million blocks if I have an

123
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,400
unlimited number of blocks how far can I

124
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,440
get which means we're asking about this

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,800
sum this harmonic number I want to know

126
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,919
about that sum do we have a closed form

127
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,639
for it no not

128
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,560
really but as we saw last time we don't

129
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,880
especially need a closed form if all we

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,680
care about is approximation so let's

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,680
approximate that sum

132
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:10,080
so we have our sum hn which is defined

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,199
as the sum of the first n

134
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,840
reciprocals and we want to approximate

135
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,919
it and can someone remind me what tool

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,240
we have to approximate sums like

137
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:25,039
this yes the integral method absolutely

138
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,199
so this function 1/x is a decreasing

139
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,759
function and so we have our integral

140
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,479
method our integral bound that says that

141
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,560
sum

142
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,560
hn is between the

143
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,479
integral plus the last term in this case

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,039
the last term is sorry plus the first

145
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,199
term

146
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:52,680
one and the integral 1 to n of 1x DX

147
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:57,280
plus the last term which is 1

148
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:00,000
n so this bound is integral plus F of n

149
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,720
less equal to the sum is less equal to

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,360
the integral plus F of

151
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,639
one and I claim this bound is really

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,800
easy to remember um like I plus FN I

153
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,440
plus F1 are pretty simple things and

154
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
also if you if if you're dealing with an

155
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,039
increasing function instead of a

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,400
decreasing function it's the same two

157
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,280
bounds but they're on the other side

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,919
just because if it's increasing then FN

159
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,800
is going to be bigger than F1 so

160
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,360
certainly FN should be on the bigger

161
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,199
side but this is a really clean bound um

162
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,800
and and we can write out what this what

163
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:38,520
this says integral from one of 1 /x DX

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,479
from 1 to n that's Ln of n let's assume

165
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,919
we can do that um without writing it

166
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,879
down I you don't want to see me

167
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,840
integrate live that will go

168
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:54,440
poorly um but what this says is that um

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,120
Ln of n + 1 n is less equal to hn is

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:01,199
less equal to Ln of

171
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,000
n + one

172
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,520
all

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,240
right which is a pretty nice

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,319
bound um but we're really interested

175
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,240
in well first let's answer our question

176
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,039
um if we want to get 10 blocks out then

177
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,280
we're asking for hn to be about

178
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,000
20 which means we're asking for these

179
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,599
bounds these bounds are kind of

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,560
basically Ln of n right the one over n

181
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,720
and and the one don't affect things all

182
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,680
that much so really hn is basically Ln

183
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,000
of

184
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,560
n yeah this is I'm being imprecise here

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,440
but we'll be more precise about it in a

186
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,760
bit but for now it's about Ln of n which

187
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,760
means to get 10 blocks

188
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:51,279
out we need hn equals 20 because the

189
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:55,000
distance was half hn uh which means we

190
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,519
need n is approximately e to the

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,040
20 we need that many

192
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,040
blocks uh we need about four 400 billion

193
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,320
blocks to get 10 blocks away from the

194
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,720
table um each one is about an inch and a

195
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,000
half thick so that gets us to carry the

196
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,160
one 40 times the distance to the

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,040
Moon um probably going to run into some

198
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,240
other issues before you're able to stack

199
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,600
something that tall um so mathematically

200
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,760
yes we can get 10 blocks over the table

201
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,800
physically not so much that's why you're

202
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,320
both right

203
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,440
um but all of this was really an excuse

204
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,839
to get us here hn is approximately Ln of

205
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,839
n plus some smaller

206
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,480
terms um and let's try to make that a

207
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,200
little more precise what do we mean by

208
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,640
that what do we mean by hn is

209
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,360
approximately Ln of n well let me give

210
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,110
us a definition

211
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,110
[Applause]

212
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:10,040
let's write that F of n that's a Tilda F

213
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,040
of n is Tia of G of n so this

214
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,040
is

215
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
asymptotically

216
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,920
equivalent so f and g are ASM totically

217
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,680
equivalent if and only if the

218
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,480
limit of FN over G of n as n goes to

219
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,399
Infinity

220
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,640
is

221
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,240
one if you divide them and get a limit

222
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,720
of one then these functions are ASM

223
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
totically

224
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,480
equivalent and in this case well we have

225
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,959
these nice bounds on

226
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,839
hn well let's take that inequality let's

227
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,519
divide all three sides U by Ln of n what

228
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:57,800
are we going to get we're going to get 1

229
00:10:52,519 --> 00:11:02,040
+ 1 over n Ln of n is less equal to hn

230
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,040
over Ln of n is less equal to 1 + 1 / Ln

231
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,240
of

232
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:12,560
N and as we take the limit as n goes to

233
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Infinity the left side looks like one

234
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,920
this thing in the denominator gets big

235
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,200
so one over that gets small the left

236
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,279
side goes to

237
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:26,079
one limb n goes to Infinity of hn over

238
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,360
Ln of N and on the right side we have

239
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,839
one plus something that goes to zero cuz

240
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,839
that denominator gets arbitrarily

241
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,720
big so the limit equals

242
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,120
one I learned this in high school as the

243
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,959
squeeze theorem if you can bound your

244
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,839
limit between two things that are the

245
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,560
same then the limit is that thing um but

246
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,720
what we've concluded here is that hn

247
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,880
ided Ln of n limits to one as n goes to

248
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,880
infinity and

249
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:06,320
therefore uh sorry hn over Ln of n

250
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,480
equals 1 which implies that hn is ASM

251
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
totically

252
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,440
equivalent to Ln of

253
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,079
n so when I wrote approximately Ln of n

254
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,560
up there probably what I meant was this

255
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,199
much more precise thing that these are

256
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,880
approximately equal in the sense that

257
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,839
their ratio limits to one does that make

258
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,680
sense

259
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,120
nice all

260
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,000
right um

261
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,920
now before moving on to ASM totic fully

262
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,639
uh there's one other topic in summations

263
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,760
that I want to talk about which is not

264
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,760
summations at all but

265
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,519
products um and really what I want to

266
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,360
say about products is that often you can

267
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:55,920
analyze products as if they were

268
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,760
sums turn into

269
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,279
sums for example if we care about n

270
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,279
factorial

271
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,399
which is uh here 1 * 2 * 3 all the way

272
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:07,760
up to

273
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,920
n who can tell me how to turn this into

274
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
a

275
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,760
sum it's something written on this

276
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:23,240
board

277
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,880
yes yeah take logs perfect what happens

278
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,720
if we take the log of both

279
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,000
sides so log of n factorial uh here

280
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,320
let's let's be precise we'll call it Ln

281
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,480
of n factorial the natural log so log

282
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,800
base

283
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,279
e well remember when you take logs

284
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,199
products turn to sums in this sense this

285
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:47,360
becomes Ln of one plus Ln of 2 plus Ln

286
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,680
of 3 plus Ln of

287
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,160
n so if we want to understand n

288
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
factorial we could just as well

289
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,959
understand its log and its log is the

290
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,720
sum of a bunch of other logs and now we

291
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,720
have a sum and we can use all of our

292
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,680
summation uh tools on this sum to get

293
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,399
information about n

294
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,800
factorial for example we could use the

295
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,160
integral bound Ln of X is an increasing

296
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,839
function this time so we use the

297
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,720
increasing version of the

298
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:19,440
bound uh which says

299
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:25,959
that uh here we go so Ln of one plus the

300
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:29,839
integral from 1 to n of Ln of X DX is

301
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:33,920
less equal to the sum of Ln of K

302
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,560
K = 1 to n Which is less equal to Ln of

303
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,920
n plus the same

304
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,160
integral and if we do out that integral

305
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,880
like I said you don't want to see me

306
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,279
integrate live I will get it wrong um

307
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,000
but if we trust my notes this integral

308
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:54,279
comes out to um n Ln of

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,759
n um minus n +

310
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:01,040
1 Ln of one is zero thankfully keeps

311
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:06,560
things simple and so what we end up

312
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:09,600
finding is that n Ln of nus n + 1 is

313
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,720
less equal to this sum which as we know

314
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,639
is Ln of n factorial Which is less equal

315
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:22,320
to this same integral plus another Ln of

316
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:24,880
n n + one Ln of nus n +

317
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,079
1 so we were able to translate this

318
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,480
product into a sum and then use our

319
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,000
summation tool um to get get us a bound

320
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,920
on Ln of N and if we want to bound on N

321
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,079
factor sorry Ln of n factorial I

322
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,720
misspoke if we want to bound on Ln I

323
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,600
misspoke again apologies if we want to

324
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,720
bound on N factorial itself we can just

325
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,279
undo the log by exponentiating all three

326
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,920
of these take e to this e to this e to

327
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,880
this that preserves our

328
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,160
inequalities and what we'll end up

329
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,519
getting after we simplify it a bit is

330
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,560
that n the N over e to the N minus1 is

331
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,279
less equ to n factorial is less equal to

332
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,399
n n

333
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,399
+1 over e

334
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,880
nus1 so same denominator on both sides

335
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,360
we have n the N versus n the N plus one

336
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,720
on the two sides so the two bounds are

337
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,160
off by a factor of n not as good as we

338
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,920
had last time we are off by an additive

339
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,959
one less than that even but a factor of

340
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,480
n isn't bad for a number as big as n

341
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,440
factorial this isn't a bad

342
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,680
bound um is everyone clear on how we got

343
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,000
to this

344
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,920
bound wonderful it's not the best bound

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,399
we have

346
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:48,279
ow um let me tell you uh two better ones

347
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,480
oh sorry before that is this bound

348
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,680
enough to say that n factorial is ASM

349
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,759
totically equivalent to one side or the

350
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,839
other I see some head shakes can someone

351
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,839
tell me why

352
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,000
that's all right I'm tired

353
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,799
too um these two bounds are too far

354
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,319
apart from each other they're a factor

355
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:20,640
of n apart and so we can't say that this

356
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:22,480
divided by this limits to one or this

357
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,799
divided by this limits to one because we

358
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,280
have an N range in there to account for

359
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,919
and N grows to Infinity so we don't know

360
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,679
where in this range and factorial lies

361
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,799
and so we can't pin down that limit

362
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,400
going to a specific value so this isn't

363
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,480
tight enough to say that n factorial is

364
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,120
ASM totically equivalent to

365
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,960
something um but that's where Sterling's

366
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,960
approximation comes

367
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,840
in um Sterling's approximation says that

368
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:08,159
n factorial is ASM totically equivalent

369
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:10,280
to theun of 2 piun n * n e to the

370
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,880
end we're not going to prove that but

371
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,400
it's really useful you should write it

372
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,120
down you might end up using it in the

373
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,799
problem set hint

374
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,360
hint um extremely

375
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,360
useful um but remember this is this is

376
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,280
just saying that n factorial divided by

377
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,440
this limits to one so when n is really

378
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,600
really big the quotient of these two

379
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,440
things is close to one

380
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,200
what it doesn't tell us is what happens

381
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,440
for smaller values of n what if n is

382
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,120
just 10 can we use this to approximate

383
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,240
10

384
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,400
factorial how about 100 how about a

385
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,080
thousand I don't know this doesn't

386
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,559
really tell us it doesn't tell us how

387
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,600
good an approximation this is all it

388
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:51,120
says is that it's good in the

389
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,760
limit um so let me tell you an even

390
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,320
stronger

391
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,080
bound uh I don't know who to credit this

392
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,480
bound to but it's even more precise than

393
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,159
this one

394
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,320
uh it says that n factorial divided by

395
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:08,600
this

396
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:11,320
Thing 2 pi n n / e to the N so this is a

397
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,600
thing that Sterling tells us limits to

398
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,960
one and now we have some bounds on how

399
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:22,840
quickly it does that e to 1 over

400
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,840
12n e to 1 over 12n +

401
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,159
1 so not only does this limit to one it

402
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,760
does so very very fast exponentially

403
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,520
fast

404
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,679
and this we can plug in specific values

405
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,919
of N and see okay how close is this

406
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,280
approximation to n factorial this is an

407
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,919
effective bound one we can get actual

408
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,600
approximations out of this is just a

409
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,159
limiting bound but of course this is a

410
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,799
lot more complicated sometimes we don't

411
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,360
want to deal with all these details and

412
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,640
this is enough sometimes even that's too

413
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,799
much and that's enough so pick your

414
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,159
level of granularity as you need

415
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,520
it we're also not going to prove this

416
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:01,000
bound um that's even harder than

417
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,600
Sterling um but it's true and useful

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,600
questions on

419
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,679
that all right so that's everything I

420
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,679
wanted to say about summations and now

421
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,200
let's jump back to astics we already

422
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,120
started talking about astics with um ASM

423
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,039
totic

424
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,120
equivalents um and let's do an

425
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,000
experiment uh let's do an exercise um

426
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,320
we've already seen a sorting algorithm

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,880
we saw swap sort um in lecture four

428
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,960
where you you have a you want to put it

429
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,039
in sorted order and you do that by

430
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,600
finding a pair that's out of order and

431
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,640
next to each other and changing their

432
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,400
order and you keep doing that keep

433
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,159
finding pairs that are next to each

434
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,080
other and out of order until the whole

435
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,640
thing is

436
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,320
sorted uh and we saw so I'm going to

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,320
call that swap

438
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,080
sort we saw that the the number of swaps

439
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,080
that you'll need to make is exactly

440
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,440
equal

441
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,720
to number of

442
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,240
swaps is exactly equal to the number of

443
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,240
inverted

444
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,600
pairs so the number of pairs of two

445
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,120
numbers in our list where the big one is

446
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,679
somewhere to the left of the small one

447
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,840
so they're in the wrong order and we'll

448
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,880
eventually need to change

449
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,640
order um and well how many inverted

450
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,919
pairs could there be in the worst case

451
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,600
well in the worst case every pair is

452
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:29,600
inverted one the number one is is

453
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,400
inverted with 2 through n

454
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,080
and two is inverted well it's already

455
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,480
inverted through one we already counted

456
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,960
that but two would be inverted with

457
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,039
three through

458
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,880
n those are new in inversions that we

459
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,880
haven't counted yet uh three is inverted

460
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,880
with everything after

461
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,080
it plus one so this is the worst case

462
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,320
number of swaps we'll have to make um

463
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,880
and as we as we've seen we know how to

464
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:03,039
compute this sum this is n minus one * n

465
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,760
/ two also known as n ^2 over 2us n

466
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,240
/2 and this I'm going to

467
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,520
call S of n we have our function s of n

468
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,840
s being reminiscent of swap sort it's a

469
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,120
function describing the worst case

470
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,000
number of swaps we'll need to make in

471
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,679
swap

472
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,559
sort on Thursday we're going to see

473
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,559
another sorting algorithm called merge

474
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
sort uh I'll describe it then I'm not

475
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,440
not going to describe it now that's we

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,919
don't need to know what it does or how

477
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,720
uh we just need to know how fast it runs

478
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,159
how many comparisons does it have to

479
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:44,080
make um so let's

480
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:48,840
define M of n this is going to be n log

481
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:52,000
2 of n minus n + one uh and on Thursday

482
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,159
we'll see that uh that merge sort takes

483
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,840
at most this many steps to

484
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:59,039
complete and now I want to know between

485
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,360
these two function

486
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,760
between these two algorithms which one

487
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,200
is a better choice for sorting lots of

488
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,240
numbers if these are the two algorithms

489
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:16,039
I have to pick from and I know their run

490
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:18,919
times they're n^2 / 2 - n / 2 versus n

491
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:22,240
log 2 N - n +

492
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,640
1 this is s this is

493
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,240
M which one's the better

494
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,799
choice um and sorry that was rhetorical

495
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,840
um let's talk through it um let's do

496
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,760
sort of an eye tracker to see which

497
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,240
parts of the various formulas we look at

498
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,200
when making this comparison uh and just

499
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,840
to emphasize I'm I'm most worried about

500
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,080
what happens with lots and lots and lots

501
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,080
of numbers I'm trying to sort a million

502
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,159
a billion a trillion numbers um so I'm

503
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,120
interested in what happens in the limit

504
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,919
as n gets really really big if we're

505
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,559
trying to sort 10 numbers well I don't

506
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,840
care that's what however you want to do

507
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:02,600
it is fine 10 is small um but with big

508
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,400
data no one uses that term anymore I

509
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:10,080
don't know why um with lots and lots of

510
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,080
data these these differences matter so

511
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,240
let's see how we make this comparison

512
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,679
what are we going to look at well the

513
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,039
first thing my eye goes

514
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,960
to is this right here which is to say

515
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,480
that's the last place my eye goes I

516
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,840
don't care about that term the n^2 over

517
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,799
two is much more important

518
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,200
um by the time we're up into the N squar

519
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:37,039
it's an a little measly n / two doesn't

520
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,960
really make much of a difference right

521
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,440
intuitively anyway I haven't made this

522
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,840
precise but the first thing that I do

523
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,080
when looking at this is I just

524
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,640
completely ignore that N /2 I don't care

525
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,039
likewise I don't care about this n minus

526
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,679
one that we're subtracting the N log n

527
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,279
grows faster than that uh so with big n

528
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,320
this is going to dominate and this is

529
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,880
just going to be a rounding eror

530
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,919
so that's the first thing I do ignore

531
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,799
the lower

532
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,120
terms now I'm just comparing n^2 2

533
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,279
versus n log

534
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,880
n the next thing I

535
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,279
ignore is this over

536
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,600
two I don't really

537
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:20,919
care I don't care that we're dividing by

538
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:25,279
two if this had been n^2 divided a th if

539
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,440
this had been a million time n log n is

540
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
that really going to change my

541
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,159
determination

542
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,000
for small n values yeah those constants

543
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,600
matter those lower terms matter for that

544
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,200
matter when n is small but in the limit

545
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,080
as n gets bigger and

546
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,679
bigger that that extra factor of n is

547
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,600
going to overtake that extra factor of

548
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,000
log n no matter what constants we throw

549
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,880
in there

550
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,159
right so I don't really care about those

551
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,919
as well really all I'm focusing on is

552
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,559
the

553
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:59,240
N2 versus the N log n does that make

554
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,320
sense um every everything I just did was

555
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,080
completely informal I haven't Justified

556
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,399
any of that but we will um but first we

557
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,640
need to motivate it and there's one

558
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:13,840
other reason uh one other motivation for

559
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,399
not really caring about this constant

560
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,679
Factor uh with swap sort we were

561
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:19,679
counting what were we counting the

562
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,520
number of actual swaps we

563
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,919
make um we didn't say how you're finding

564
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,559
those swaps but there are there are

565
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,799
clean ways to do it so that the number

566
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,520
of steps you take um in the whole

567
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:34,679
algorithm is about n^2 over

568
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,960
two um but wait we have to do more steps

569
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,200
than just the swaps right we have to

570
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,520
like read numbers from memory we have to

571
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,840
um compare them we have to write numbers

572
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,840
to memory we have to increment our index

573
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,360
we have lots and lots of instructions

574
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,480
that we have to do during this algorithm

575
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,120
so maybe it's just those four

576
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,080
instructions every time we make a swap

577
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:00,080
so it's really four times n^2 over two

578
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,080
instructions

579
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,679
right instead of counting swaps we're

580
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,440
now counting instructions and I'm being

581
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:10,360
very loose about that but doesn't matter

582
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,840
um okay well not all instructions are

583
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,720
are created equal um every instruction

584
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:21,279
on your CPU happens on a a fixed regular

585
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,840
clock um and maybe ads

586
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,760
take when we have to increment our index

587
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,720
maybe that takes I don't know five

588
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,360
Cycles uh and

589
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,919
comparisons take 15 cycles and

590
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,880
read and write to memory take I don't

591
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,960
know 200 Cycles because memory is a lot

592
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,760
slower than arithmetic I made up these

593
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,480
numbers by the way these aren't real

594
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,960
don't trust me on that um but in this

595
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,919
fiction if we're counting Cycles instead

596
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,760
of instructions we're doing like one of

597
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,360
each of these per per round or something

598
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,320
um so really we're doing if I did my

599
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,320
math right about 210 *

600
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
n^2

601
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,279
Cycles okay so we're changing our unit

602
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,000
we're measuring different things um

603
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,640
let's measure something else say we're

604
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,960
on a 2.4 gigahertz processor 2.4

605
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,960
gigahertz processor how long does this

606
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:27,080
take in in real life time well it takes

607
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,080
about 210 divided 2.4

608
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,279
billion seconds uh sorry times n^ 2

609
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,279
seconds right so if we change what we're

610
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,039
measuring if we change our units

611
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,919
instructions Cycles

612
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,679
seconds the thing that stays is the N

613
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,840
squared the constant

614
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:54,240
changes but it's always proportional to

615
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:56,600
n^2 get a better um CPU um higher

616
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,200
throughput your time decreases but only

617
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,320
by a constant factor it's still

618
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,760
proportional to

619
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,519
n^2 this is another reason that it's

620
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,080
useful to be able to just ignore that

621
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,760
constant I don't care what it is because

622
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,960
I don't really care specifically what

623
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,679
units we're

624
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,799
measuring um I just care that it's

625
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,880
proportional to the right

626
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,320
answer does that kind of make sense why

627
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,080
we might want to throw away information

628
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,720
like this because it's easier to think

629
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,840
about n squ is easier to think about

630
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,159
than all this other junk cluttering it

631
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,000
up

632
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,480
um one more one more motivating example

633
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
what's the population of the

634
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,000
US does anyone know just off the top

635
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,159
yes about 330 million

636
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,679
absolutely about

637
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:49,679
335 um what is it um I wrote it down

638
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,679
893,00

639
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,120
is that more useful than what your

640
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,080
colleague said 330

641
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,720
million I don't get any more information

642
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,440
out of that in in my measly little brain

643
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,320
330 is I already have trouble conceiving

644
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,320
of a number that large I don't need all

645
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,840
the extra detail

646
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,919
right same for algorithm analysis I want

647
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,720
to be able to just focus in on the parts

648
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,399
that matter and have the option to strip

649
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,240
off the parts that don't so that's our

650
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,480
motivation we want to be able to to

651
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,279
communicate less information about the

652
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,080
run times of our algorithms or about

653
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,720
other

654
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,279
functions while still being

655
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,600
mathematically precise about it and

656
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,320
making sure we know what what was lost

657
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,679
what information are we retaining and

658
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,559
what information are we losing never to

659
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,440
to get again because

660
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,600
sometimes you need that extra

661
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,519
information throwing away all this stuff

662
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,559
is a great like broad Strokes way to

663
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,039
compare um certain algorithms but if we

664
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,519
have two algorithms that are both

665
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:04,039
proportional to n log n oh well now that

666
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,279
constant Factor really matters and we

667
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:08,720
better go and figure out what it is

668
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:10,720
likewise if we're comparing the US

669
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,639
population between this year and last

670
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,600
year well last year it was also about

671
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:19,279
330 million in change so if all we know

672
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,880
is 330 330 we can't compare them we

673
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,600
don't know if it went up or down or by

674
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,279
how much um turns out last year it was

675
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,360
about

676
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:31,880
334 um2 million

677
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,880
um

678
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,559
million so now we had a reason that we

679
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,320
wanted more information wanted more

680
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,039
precise measurements of the population

681
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,559
than just 330

682
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:44,760
million um but wait until you have that

683
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,519
reason let's let's do the broad stroke

684
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,600
stuff first and often that'll be

685
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,760
enough does that make sense as a

686
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,880
motivation for why we want to throw away

687
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,440
information about our functions

688
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,200
nice so

689
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,799
let's talk about how to do

690
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:07,000
that uh and the the main one we're going

691
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,000
to talk about is called Big O

692
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,080
notation the idea this is not yet a

693
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,360
definition still an idea uh we're going

694
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,120
to say that F of n belongs to Big O of G

695
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,480
of

696
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:26,159
n weird notation but you'll get used to

697
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,679
it um

698
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,600
when well roughly

699
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:36,880
F of n is less equal to G of

700
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,720
n roughly if we say f is Big O of G what

701
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,200
we're saying is that an algorithm with

702
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,760
runtime f ofn is at least as fast maybe

703
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,279
maybe much faster than an algorithm with

704
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,080
runtime G of

705
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:52,279
n with some

706
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,279
caveats with

707
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,279
caveats first of all let's throw away

708
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,279
constant factors

709
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,159
if we have to scale G up by 10 and now G

710
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,320
is bigger that's fine that's still Big O

711
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,559
uh and likewise we're going to ignore I

712
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,559
don't care what happens for small

713
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,559
numbers

714
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,600
ignoring small n don't need them I care

715
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,279
about what happens in the limit what are

716
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,080
the trends when n gets bigger and bigger

717
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:37,080
so these are my intuitions um

718
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,080
also

719
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,279
ignoring lower order

720
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:45,720
terms I still haven't defined that

721
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,080
either by the way but we talked about

722
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,960
them over here like the N /2 was a lower

723
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,799
order term compared to n^2 over two I

724
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,519
want to be able to ignore things like

725
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,840
that so this is still not precise let's

726
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,360
finally finally make it precise after

727
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,399
this question

728
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,919
yes oh no I want to give the definition

729
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,960
thank

730
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,480
you uh okay so our definition our actual

731
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:15,520
final definition of Big O is the

732
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,399
following um f of n is in Big O of G of

733
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,960
N

734
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:22,879
means

735
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:27,119
okay there exists a number greater than

736
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,839
zero and there exists a natural number

737
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,320
and not

738
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:37,800
such that for all n greater or equal to

739
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,399
n f of n is less equal to C

740
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,800
* G of

741
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,399
n um and if we're not being if we're not

742
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,800
restricting to positive functions

743
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,119
sometimes we put an absolute value in

744
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,320
there that's less important the other

745
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,359
parts of the formula are the more

746
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,560
important parts there exists a constant

747
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:03,200
factor C so that f is less equal to C *

748
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:06,960
G that's this ignoring constant

749
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,400
factors um there exists an N so that all

750
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,720
n greater than n greater than or equal

751
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,880
to n so there's some starting point so

752
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,520
that after that starting point this this

753
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,760
inequality is always true and I don't

754
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,320
care what happens before n

755
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,599
knot

756
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,240
um so that's this point here ignoring

757
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,960
small n small n are the ones smaller

758
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:35,079
than n then n not um n Subzero is

759
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,280
sometimes pronounced n not n a u g

760
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,280
HT uh

761
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,359
question oh gosh yes thank

762
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:50,119
you uh G of

763
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,000
n not the line I wanted to mess up today

764
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,200
thank you so much yes F of n is in bigo

765
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,280
of G of N means roughly that g is bigger

766
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,680
if you're allowed to scale it by a

767
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,000
constant and throw away small

768
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,000
values all right

769
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,359
yes yeah um

770
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,240
so

771
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:18,480
um FN is in bigo of g ofn means that

772
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,720
there's some positive value C and some

773
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,560
starting point n KN so that for all

774
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:28,880
input values that are bigger than n not

775
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,599
or equal FN is less or equal to C * G of

776
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,400
n uh so this is extending our intuition

777
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,920
that FN is small that f is smaller than

778
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,760
G but you're allowed to put in a

779
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,400
constant Factor if you need to before

780
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,400
that's true

781
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:49,640
yes um yeah so why are the question was

782
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,000
why are we putting in a constant Factor

783
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,880
when the whole point was to ignore the

784
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,200
constant Factor we ignore it by saying

785
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,040
that there exists a constant factor and

786
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,280
I don't care what it is as long as some

787
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,960
constant exists that makes this formula

788
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:10,520
true then f is Big O of

789
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:15,560
G um so we put it in so that we can not

790
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,920
care what its value is um yes can the

791
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,839
Conant between Z and one can the

792
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,359
constant be between zero and one good

793
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,119
question sure why not um if you want to

794
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:26,200
make G smaller and it's still bigger

795
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,079
than F go for

796
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,920
it no problems there all right let's do

797
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,359
some examples hopefully some concrete

798
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,599
examples will make this a bit

799
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:41,359
clearer um let's

800
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:46,599
say F of n is n g of n is n

801
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,599
2 is f of n in Big O of G of

802
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,720
n so is n in Big O of n

803
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,359
squ well if this is supposed to say that

804
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,040
the thing on the right is bigger then

805
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:02,560
hopefully we would want n squ to be

806
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:05,040
bigger than n and thankfully it is um in

807
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,720
this case we don't need the C to help us

808
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,400
f is already smaller than g n is already

809
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,480
smaller than

810
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:18,680
n^2 n is less equal to 1 * n^

811
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:22,319
2 for all n for all natural numbers n so

812
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:26,040
this would be our n value of zero and

813
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:28,240
this would be our C value of one all we

814
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,160
have to do is show that some not exists

815
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,160
and some C

816
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,319
exists to make this statement true and

817
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,720
then we're able to conclude that n is

818
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,720
Big O of n^ s

819
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,920
question um ah good question um don't we

820
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,920
need n not to be one because this

821
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,119
inequality is false when n is between

822
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,480
zero and one um excellent point um

823
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,440
I'm going to give two fixes for that

824
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,960
first of all we could change this to one

825
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:09,480
absolutely that's fine um the other

826
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,839
change is that let's go ahead and assume

827
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,079
that f and g are mapping the natural

828
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,359
numbers to the real

829
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,680
numbers so the inputs are just 0 1 2 3

830
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,520
and not all the real numbers in between

831
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,160
often that's what we use when we're

832
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,760
analyzing algorithms because we don't

833
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,880
have fractional inputs to to algorithms

834
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,000
um you could absolutely do all of this

835
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,640
analysis and all these definitions if

836
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,720
your domain was the reals

837
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,640
instead um but let's let's deal with

838
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:44,640
Naturals great uh great point also in

839
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,000
fact why don't we go ahead and assume

840
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,920
that all our functions are positive

841
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,839
valued um then we won't need that weird

842
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,040
absolute value you can still do a lot of

843
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:57,599
this um if you allow some of your

844
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,280
functions to be zero or negative but but

845
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,560
let's not clutter our minds with that

846
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,000
today let's go ahead and assume that all

847
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:07,200
of our functions map the natural numbers

848
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,200
to positive real values

849
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,280
yes um the question was is this

850
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,920
statement equivalent to saying that f is

851
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,119
ASM totically equivalent to some

852
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,240
constant multiple of G that's a great

853
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,319
question the answer is no uh and I'll

854
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,319
challenge you to think about why

855
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,520
um let's do a few more examples uh

856
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,520
actually I want to come back over

857
00:40:49,240 --> 00:41:01,680
here all right F of n is n

858
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,680
s g of n is n F of n in Big O of G of

859
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:09,720
n is n s smaller than n if you're

860
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,400
allowed to scale by a

861
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,480
constant and this time the answer is

862
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,440
no um an algorithm that takes n s time

863
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,359
certainly wants to look slower take

864
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,000
longer than an algorithm that takes n

865
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:25,079
time so if Big O is going to be useful

866
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,960
for algorithm

867
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,240
comparison we hope that this would be f

868
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,079
and thankfully it is and let's talk

869
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:38,240
about

870
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:39,319
why um so if n s were in Big O of n we

871
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,079
would

872
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:43,280
need there exists a c and there exists

873
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,440
an

874
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:53,599
N so that for all n greater equal to n

875
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:56,240
KN uh let's see n^2 is less equal to C *

876
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,119
n right I just wrote out the

877
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,920
definition so we would need to be able

878
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,119
to pick some constant and some starting

879
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,440
point so that after that starting point

880
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,079
n^2 is always less equal to that fixed

881
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,440
constant times n but no matter what

882
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,599
constant we

883
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,240
pick when n gets big enough this

884
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,200
inequality is always

885
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,720
false we can't pick a constant big

886
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:23,720
enough so that this remains true for all

887
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:26,359
n for all big n if we pick C is a th

888
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,119
then from a th and one on this

889
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,000
inequality is going to be be false if C

890
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,040
is a million then from a million and one

891
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,960
on this inequality is false no matter

892
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,599
what C we pick the left side will

893
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,040
overtake the right

894
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,119
side right and increasing n not doesn't

895
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,760
help with

896
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:46,520
that even if we ignore more small values

897
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,079
all the big values fail you can't ignore

898
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,160
all the values

899
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,160
so

900
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,760
um can't

901
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,760
choose c big enough

902
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,359
all right so thankfully n^2 is not Big O

903
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:12,720
of n uh let's do another example uh is

904
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:15,040
n^2 + 3 n + 7 is that Big O of

905
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,359
n^2 we said we wanted to be able to

906
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,680
ignore lower order terms ignore things

907
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:22,240
that look

908
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,880
smaller um

909
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,400
well this one ends up being true and

910
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,920
let's see why well we can write right

911
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,520
there are lots of ways to prove this um

912
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,800
I'm going to be extremely wasteful and

913
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:42,280
do the following n^2 + 3 n + 7 is less

914
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:45,559
equal to n^2 + 3 n^ 2 + 7 n^

915
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,480
2 all I'm doing is saying this n is less

916
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:51,920
equal to n s this

917
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:54,960
seven uh this seven is less equal to 7 n

918
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,040
2 right and this

919
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,040
equals 11 N2

920
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,079
and so we've we were able to show that

921
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,160
this function is less equal to 11 * this

922
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:13,000
function for all

923
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:15,240
n so we can take n equals z and C is 11

924
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,319
and we're

925
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,559
done so lower order terms like this at

926
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:23,760
most Force us to pick a bigger C if we

927
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,880
want but again we don't care about the

928
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,800
specific value of C as long as such a

929
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,000
value exists so we can always swallow up

930
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,319
these these smaller terms just absorb

931
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,319
them into that c constant

932
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,240
yes good question what if we didn't know

933
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,520
whether one function is bigger than

934
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,240
another function just by looking at it

935
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,760
um well that is that is our task um

936
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,359
we're trying to compare these functions

937
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,599
and if we don't know which one's bigger

938
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,760
then we better figure figure that out

939
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,839
before we get our

940
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:06,760
answer so I don't have a general way to

941
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,760
do that um I'm I can just say that it's

942
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:16,440
necessary um let's do another example 3

943
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,240
n is that Big O of n minus 4 we were

944
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,559
also saying we'd like to be able to

945
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,400
ignore lower order terms on the right

946
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:26,440
hand side and intuitively that n minus 4

947
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,520
that minus 4 term doesn't really change

948
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,839
anything

949
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:35,599
this should still look like Big O of

950
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:40,160
n right and we can make that precise um

951
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:43,520
nus 4 is greater than or equal to n

952
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,520
minus well n

953
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,119
/2 when n is at least

954
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,920
eight all we're saying is that the N

955
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,400
function overtakes the four

956
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,640
function excuse me so this four we can

957
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,880
pretend it's a

958
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,319
n/2 we've lost a lot but it doesn't

959
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,359
matter because this is still a

960
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,480
constant time

961
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:09,760
n so this

962
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,160
function is bigger than a constant time

963
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:18,920
n and we can use that to do our proof um

964
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:23,359
3n let's see 3 n is less equal to 6 * 12

965
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:28,920
n Which is less equal to 6

966
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:28,920
* um that's that so nus 4

967
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,839
when n is at least

968
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,599
eight and so now we have our

969
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:41,200
C and we have our

970
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,400
n 3n is less equal to a constant times n

971
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,359
minus 4 which is the function we care

972
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,520
about so in the same way we can ignore

973
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:50,920
lower order terms on the right again by

974
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,280
just swallowing them into the constant C

975
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,079
at the cost of a slightly higher

976
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,960
constant C does that make

977
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,880
sense nice now some of you might

978
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,359
recognize the definition of Big O is

979
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,000
looking a lot like Epsilon Delta

980
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:06,400
definitions of limits and you if you

981
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,680
haven't seen those that's fine don't

982
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,920
worry it doesn't matter but um they are

983
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,440
similar Concepts and we have a useful

984
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:20,400
fact that um compares the two that I

985
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,400
will write down now

986
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,839
theorem so we're assuming that f and g

987
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,839
are functions from

988
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:36,040
n to r+ to the positive

989
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,119
reals

990
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:42,960
if the limit of f of n over G of n as n

991
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,960
goes to

992
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Infinity

993
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:54,319
exists and equals

994
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,839
infinity so if F over G gets arbitrarily

995
00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:00,359
big then there's no constant you can

996
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:04,880
choose to bring G back up to F because F

997
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:08,520
gets um bigger and bigger compared to

998
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:11,119
G then f is not

999
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,240
in Big O of

1000
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,839
G

1001
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,839
likewise if the limit

1002
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,000
exists and is less than

1003
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,280
infinity then f is

1004
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:33,480
in Big O of

1005
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,480
G and

1006
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,720
finally if the limit does not

1007
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:48,680
exist inconclusive F might be Big O of g

1008
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,280
f might not be Big O of G if the limit

1009
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,520
doesn't exist the limit doesn't help us

1010
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,720
get an

1011
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,240
answer but if the limit does exist it

1012
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,240
tells us the answer if the limit exists

1013
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:04,359
it tells us yes in this case no in that

1014
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,480
case so this is a one-sided test if the

1015
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:08,799
limit exists you're golden if the limit

1016
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,599
doesn't exist you have to fall back to

1017
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:13,760
the more complicated

1018
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:16,040
definition all right uh I'm not going to

1019
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,559
prove that it's uh not difficult to

1020
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,839
prove it's in the notes if you want to

1021
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:27,680
read about it but let's use it uh let's

1022
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:27,680
see is n^2 in Big O of a million

1023
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:37,520
n well how do we test that let let's use

1024
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:43,520
this limit test we can look at the limit

1025
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:46,760
of f over G of n^2 over a million n as n

1026
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:50,640
goes to Infinity n^2 over a constant

1027
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:53,160
time n that's

1028
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,520
infinity and so the limit exists it

1029
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,640
equals infinity and that tells us that f

1030
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,640
is not Big O of

1031
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:06,040
so very often if you're working with

1032
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:07,960
actual functions and you can actually

1033
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,559
take the limit and the limit actually

1034
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,160
exists you get your answer much faster

1035
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,760
than if you were trying to think through

1036
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,760
the C's and the nend knots and

1037
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:23,559
whatnot um another example is a thousand

1038
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:23,559
in Big O of

1039
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:29,119
n^2 what the heck do I even mean by that

1040
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,359
a thousand isn't a function of N I

1041
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,119
thought we were talking about functions

1042
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:33,200
of

1043
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,079
n

1044
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,240
right well it is a function of n if you

1045
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,599
want to think of it that way let me plot

1046
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,599
it for

1047
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:48,720
you let let me plot the N

1048
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,480
SAR this is uh n s and let me plot the

1049
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,319
function that takes every n and sends it

1050
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,319
to the value a

1051
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:01,880
th right right so this is f of n which

1052
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:04,160
is defined as no matter what your input

1053
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,400
is ignore it and spit out a thousand

1054
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,599
it's the constant function that spits

1055
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,280
out a thousand so when you see something

1056
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:13,520
like this when you see a constant in one

1057
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,359
of these ASM totic uh notations it's

1058
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,680
really talking about the constant

1059
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,880
function that sends every n to that

1060
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,559
value and in that

1061
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,160
sense now we can ask is this constant

1062
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,559
function Big O of

1063
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,119
n^2 and we can answer it the same way as

1064
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:34,559
before by looking at the limmit of f

1065
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:37,640
over G the limit of f which is a th over

1066
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:42,440
G which is N2 2 as n goes to

1067
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:46,319
Infinity that limit is zero so

1068
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:48,799
yes yes a th is Big O of n^2 when the

1069
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:52,040
limit exists it's great we're very

1070
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:52,040
happy more

1071
00:51:54,799 --> 00:52:00,839
examples we're trying to be permissive

1072
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:06,359
with constant factors right

1073
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:08,960
so is it true that 3 to the N is Big O

1074
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,960
of 2 to the

1075
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,440
N if constant factors don't matter then

1076
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,799
maybe I maybe I should be able to change

1077
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,799
this constant to a different constant

1078
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,640
and it won't really change according to

1079
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:23,599
Big O is this

1080
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:26,640
true and this time it's not because we

1081
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:29,359
can try our limit test the limit of f

1082
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,760
over G that's 3 the N over 2 the

1083
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:35,799
N that's the limit of 1.5 to the

1084
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,520
N which is

1085
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:41,640
infinity so the answer is no changing

1086
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,599
this two to a three isn't changing by a

1087
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,359
constant factor it's changing by a

1088
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,760
constant Factor n

1089
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,319
times and that n um gets bigger and

1090
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:54,319
bigger so the difference between the two

1091
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:57,119
sides gets bigger and bigger so this is

1092
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,640
uh this is a no

1093
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,520
all right um some quick

1094
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:06,720
notation I've been

1095
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,720
writing F of n is in Big O of G of

1096
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:12,720
n um and this is my preferred notation

1097
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:15,599
this is set notation f ofn is an element

1098
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,680
of this set so big O of G of n is really

1099
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,079
a set of all the functions that have the

1100
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,160
relationship we

1101
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,240
described this I think is the clearest

1102
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,680
notation it's what I it's what I

1103
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,440
encourage you to use but you're going to

1104
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,400
see some other not ations for example

1105
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,760
you're going to see F of n equals Big O

1106
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:37,079
of G of n which is just super confusing

1107
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,520
I don't like it I don't recommend using

1108
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:41,160
it but it is pretty standard in the math

1109
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,720
community so you are going to see it so

1110
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:48,040
I have to warn you

1111
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:51,640
um you're also going to see f ofn is

1112
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:54,680
less equal to Big O of G of

1113
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:56,920
n this is again an an abuse of notation

1114
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,440
FN is a function this thing on the right

1115
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,720
is a set but it's communicating the same

1116
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,760
idea in fact it's emphasizing that same

1117
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:07,559
idea Big O means that g is bigger than F

1118
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:10,200
roughly and so this less equal sign is

1119
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,280
just a reminder of that so this is also

1120
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,200
good notation I recommend it if you want

1121
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,079
to use

1122
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:21,920
it um you're also going to see f ofn is

1123
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:25,200
Big O G of n instead of is an element of

1124
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,960
Big O of G of n that's also fine um

1125
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,040
pretty clear unambiguous

1126
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,960
all of these mean exactly the same

1127
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,359
thing sound

1128
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:37,520
good all right what you should not write

1129
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:41,040
ever um so we were

1130
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:47,920
saying uh for example we know that merge

1131
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:50,359
merge sort MN is less equal to Big O of

1132
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,880
uh swap swort of n those two functions

1133
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:55,319
we looked at earlier the n s one and the

1134
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,319
N log N1 so this is a true statement

1135
00:54:55,319 --> 00:55:00,079
right the one was smaller if we want to

1136
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:02,599
say that the S is

1137
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,880
bigger should we say that SN is greater

1138
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,880
or equal to Big O of M of

1139
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:12,200
N and from the way I'm phrasing the

1140
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,799
question the answer is probably no um no

1141
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,160
we should not write this that's like

1142
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:19,640
saying you must be at least 60 in or

1143
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:23,480
less to ride this

1144
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:28,039
ride how tall do I need to be

1145
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:31,440
6 it's not correct um Big O is functions

1146
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:33,680
that are smaller than M of N and if

1147
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,720
we're supposed to be bigger than some

1148
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,079
functions that are smaller than M of n

1149
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,720
it doesn't make sense don't write that

1150
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,720
however this is still an idea that we

1151
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,760
often want to communicate s is bigger

1152
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,799
than M we want to emphasize that s is

1153
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,319
bigger than M instead of emphasizing

1154
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,599
that m is smaller than S and we have

1155
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:57,440
different notation for that instead of a

1156
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,960
big O we use S is

1157
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,400
big

1158
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:05,640
Omega of M of M of

1159
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,760
n so big Omega is just the the reverse

1160
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:13,960
of Big O U we have our

1161
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:18,839
definition f is in big Omega of g

1162
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:20,280
means that g is in Big O of f let's take

1163
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:22,119
that as our

1164
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,799
definition and we're getting lots of

1165
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:27,960
symbols around here so let's see if we

1166
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:27,960
can compile them into a table

1167
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,240
so we started with f is ASM totically

1168
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:38,640
equivalent to

1169
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:43,520
G um the definition is that the limit as

1170
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:44,720
n goes to Infinity of f of n over G of n

1171
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:49,160
equals

1172
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,680
1 the idea the intuition is that f is

1173
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:58,240
equivalent to

1174
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:58,240
G um up to lower order terms lower order

1175
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:05,200
terms that was our

1176
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,319
intuition then we had Big O F is in Big

1177
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,440
O of

1178
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:13,799
G the definition this time was there

1179
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:17,520
exists C greater Z there exists uh n KN

1180
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:18,960
greater equal zero so that for all n

1181
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:24,359
greater equal to

1182
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:26,720
n uh F of n is less equal to C * G of

1183
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:27,640
n so that's our definition

1184
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,240
our

1185
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:36,599
intuition is that f is less equal to

1186
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:40,319
G up to constant values up to constant

1187
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:43,200
factors and I'll say lower order

1188
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,640
terms and ignoring small numbers but

1189
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,400
that one does that

1190
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,200
too please don't confuse the intuition

1191
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,200
with the

1192
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:52,480
definition and please don't use the

1193
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,640
intuition language in your proofs use

1194
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,160
the the definition language in your

1195
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,359
proofs so think about it this way but

1196
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,280
write it this

1197
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:04,799
way and we Justus

1198
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:08,640
defined f is in big Omega of

1199
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:13,280
g means the definition is that

1200
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,280
g uh is in Big O of

1201
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:21,599
F and the idea is that uh G is greater

1202
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,119
sorry is

1203
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:28,559
that f is greater equal to

1204
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:32,319
G up two

1205
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,319
constants and lower order

1206
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,160
terms right so we have a a more

1207
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,799
permissive version of less equal that's

1208
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:41,440
Big O A more permissive version of

1209
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:44,000
greater equal that's big

1210
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,760
Omega questions about

1211
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,920
that all

1212
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,319
right um what did I want to say about

1213
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:56,559
that let me Define one more while I'm

1214
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:58,839
over here f is in Theta

1215
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:03,119
of G that's a capital Greek

1216
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:06,200
Theta um and this is going to mean

1217
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:10,520
roughly uh f equals

1218
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:14,039
g sorry f is approximately equal to

1219
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:17,760
G up to

1220
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:21,039
constants and lower order

1221
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,760
terms and the definition is just

1222
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:28,839
f is in Big O of

1223
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,839
G and G is in in Big O of

1224
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:38,039
f so f and g are roughly within constant

1225
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,039
factors of each other in both

1226
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,480
directions uh and I want to call

1227
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,559
attention to this first one versus this

1228
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,799
last

1229
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,599
one ASM totic equivalence said that f

1230
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:50,839
and g were roughly equal up to lower

1231
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,920
order

1232
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:56,480
terms Theta says that f and g are

1233
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,920
approximately equal up to con constant

1234
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,359
factors and lower order

1235
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:05,480
terms Theta is more permissive than

1236
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:09,520
Tilda um where did I leave off on the

1237
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:13,079
boards over here yeah over

1238
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:16,079
[Applause]

1239
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:16,079
here

1240
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,960
B so we can say that our our s of n

1241
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,440
function our our swap sort our simple

1242
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:31,520
sort function n^2 over two and junk

1243
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,520
uh is in Theta of

1244
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:39,000
n^2 it's both greater than um n^2 and

1245
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,760
less than n^2 if you're allowed to put

1246
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,920
constants in

1247
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:47,920
there all

1248
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:51,039
right um what's not

1249
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:54,079
true is SN is ASM totically equivalent

1250
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:56,799
to N2 this is

1251
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,440
false um because if you if you take this

1252
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:02,720
and divide by that and take the limit

1253
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:05,480
you get two not one that n^2 over two

1254
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:09,119
matters um so this cares what that

1255
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:10,839
constant factor is this doesn't um this

1256
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,520
would be a true statement if you put the

1257
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:13,520
one/ half in

1258
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,119
there so the ASM totic equivalence does

1259
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,799
single out that constant Factor whereas

1260
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:26,200
Theta ignores that constant

1261
01:01:21,799 --> 01:01:26,200
Factor was there a question

1262
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:40,839
um okay so the question was um similar

1263
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,319
to your previous question um does f in

1264
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:46,599
Theta of g

1265
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:50,920
mean that there exists a

1266
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:53,319
constant such that f is Tilda of C time

1267
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,880
G that's a really good

1268
01:01:53,319 --> 01:02:00,480
question um

1269
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,240
and the answer I will tell you um is

1270
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,920
actually the other

1271
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:08,079
way if there's a constant factor between

1272
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:10,599
them and then the limit goes to one uh

1273
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:12,880
then absolutely they are Theta of each

1274
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:15,119
other but there doesn't have to be that

1275
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,680
constant factor and let's look at an

1276
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,680
example of that

1277
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,039
let's see 3 + sin of

1278
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:36,240
n is that

1279
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,240
Theta of

1280
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:42,039
one 3 + S of n we want to know is it

1281
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,680
Theta of

1282
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:49,160
one so is it bounded below and bounded

1283
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:54,000
above by some constant times

1284
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:57,640
one and in this case yes it is because 2

1285
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,160
is less equal to 3 + s of n Which is

1286
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,160
less equal to

1287
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,720
four so there's we can scale this by a

1288
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,880
constant and it's always smaller than

1289
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,119
our function we can scale this by a

1290
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,559
different constant and it's always

1291
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,720
bigger than our function and that's the

1292
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:17,039
condition we needed for Big O on both

1293
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:19,119
sides so yes this is

1294
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,119
true however you're never going to find

1295
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:24,799
a constant where 3 + sin of

1296
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:27,200
n is ASM totically equivalent to that

1297
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:29,799
constant * 1

1298
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:33,079
because that ratio isn't going to have a

1299
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:39,359
limit this is an example where the

1300
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:41,680
limit of 3 + sin of n over

1301
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:43,960
one does not

1302
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,599
exist the function just keeps doing this

1303
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,760
forever and never settles down and picks

1304
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,960
a single

1305
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,279
value so this is an example where the

1306
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,119
limit between them does not

1307
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:57,119
exist but still they are Big O of each

1308
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:57,119
other

1309
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,799
right um in fact in both directions we

1310
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:04,720
mentioned earlier that if the limit

1311
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:07,319
doesn't exist sometimes um they are not

1312
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:10,400
Big O of each other can anyone think of

1313
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:13,359
an example of that two functions uh

1314
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:17,640
whose ratio does not have a limit where

1315
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:17,640
f is not Big O of G

1316
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,960
little

1317
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:39,039
tricky uh let me give Let me Give an

1318
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:41,000
example uh let's say that F of

1319
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:46,400
n is

1320
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:50,640
n and G of n is one when n is

1321
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,640
odd and n^ S when n is

1322
01:04:53,119 --> 01:05:03,000
even so if we plot

1323
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:06,799
F of n is just n g of n um is following

1324
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:10,799
one or n s depending where you are and

1325
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:10,799
it's sort of zigzagging between the

1326
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:17,400
two if you scale G by a constant you'll

1327
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,720
never be able to make it bigger or

1328
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,799
smaller than

1329
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:24,799
n um because the the ratio is is too

1330
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,720
much depending whether you're looking at

1331
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,079
the odds or the evens

1332
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:32,599
um you can't scale it in either

1333
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:38,599
direction so F in Big O of G is

1334
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:38,599
false and G in Big O of f is also

1335
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:43,400
false um and it was specially

1336
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:47,279
constructed so that

1337
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:50,640
limit of f over G as n goes to

1338
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:53,640
Infinity um does not

1339
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:56,400
exist because on the odds F overg grows

1340
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,599
really big and on the evens f over G is

1341
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,599
really

1342
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,480
small sound good

1343
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:07,000
nice all

1344
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:10,119
right speaking of getting really big and

1345
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,119
really small um there are two more ASM

1346
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:15,000
totic symbols that we need to add to our

1347
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:19,160
table uh and those are the last two I

1348
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,160
promise um the first one I want to

1349
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:26,039
Define is

1350
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:29,520
called little o

1351
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:33,039
so f is in little o of

1352
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,240
G the definition is going to be that the

1353
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:39,839
limit as n goes to

1354
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:44,039
Infinity of f of n over G of

1355
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:47,240
n equals z and the

1356
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:49,960
intuition is that f is much much much

1357
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:52,680
smaller than

1358
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:55,720
G if we want to say that f is

1359
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,880
insignificant compared to G

1360
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,279
that's just saying that the limit

1361
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,359
between them goes to

1362
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:05,079
zero right so that's our that's going to

1363
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:07,960
be our definition of little O notation

1364
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:10,079
wise little o and Big O look

1365
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:13,119
similar um so when you're writing those

1366
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,440
by hand please try to exaggerate uh I I

1367
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,520
like to write My Little O's really

1368
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:20,079
really small um like even smaller than

1369
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:23,119
other lowercase letters and I like to

1370
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,880
write my Big O really really big not

1371
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,599
like hilariously big but noticeably big

1372
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,559
so no one's going to confuse it for a

1373
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,200
little

1374
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,920
o

1375
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,640
um annoying notation that those look

1376
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:38,839
similar so just be aware and uh try to

1377
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:43,520
correct for it um and there's the

1378
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:45,799
reverse f is in little Omega of G that's

1379
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:48,720
the lowercase Omega compared to the

1380
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:51,480
capital Omega up there means the

1381
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:57,319
opposite that the limit as n goes to

1382
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:59,520
Infinity of f of n over G of n equals

1383
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:04,200
infinity

1384
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,200
AKA G is in little o of

1385
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:11,720
f so if we want to stress that f is much

1386
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,039
much bigger than G we can use the little

1387
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:18,199
Omega

1388
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:19,839
notation that f is much much bigger than

1389
01:08:18,199 --> 01:08:22,040
G all

1390
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,120
right and these are

1391
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,199
useful I mean for the same reasons the

1392
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,279
other things are useful they're giving

1393
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:32,199
us more vocabulary to compare functions

1394
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:34,239
um in ways that let us think about only

1395
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:39,839
a small amount of information about each

1396
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:43,319
function um but little o is sort of

1397
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:45,679
exactly what we meant by lower order

1398
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:48,359
term uh

1399
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:51,759
claim uh that f is going to be ASM

1400
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:55,560
totically equivalent to f plus

1401
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:58,719
h if and only if

1402
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:01,679
H is in little o of

1403
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:05,679
f if and only

1404
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:09,520
if the limit of H over f is

1405
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:12,400
zero h of n over F of n as n goes to

1406
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,640
Infinity so lower order term just means

1407
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:17,199
the ratio goes to zero in the

1408
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,120
limit uh and that's consistent with what

1409
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:21,239
we've been saying with lower order terms

1410
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,759
all throughout today lower order term

1411
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:26,400
just means limit goes to zero and we

1412
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:29,640
have a special notation for that

1413
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:33,080
o um f is ASM totically equivalent to f

1414
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:35,359
plus h means that according to ASM totic

1415
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:38,600
equivalence the H didn't change

1416
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,960
anything the H was insignificant so

1417
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,520
that's another way to think about what

1418
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,319
we mean by lower order

1419
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,120
term make

1420
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:51,199
sense

1421
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:56,040
nice um cool last thing I want to do

1422
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:56,040
today is a big old warning

1423
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:06,920
Asim totic

1424
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,640
notation and

1425
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,400
induction don't mix

1426
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:27,000
easily if you're ever doing astics and

1427
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:30,480
induction in the same same

1428
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,080
breadth step back take care let's see

1429
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,080
what can go

1430
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,880
wrong all right so

1431
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:52,000
theorem question

1432
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:54,640
mark 2 to the N is Big O of

1433
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,080
one now we really really hope this isn't

1434
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,280
true in algorithm terms this is an

1435
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,960
algorithm that takes exponential time

1436
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,080
this is an algorithm that takes constant

1437
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,679
time certainly this one's supposed to be

1438
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:09,679
the smaller one so 2 to the N should

1439
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:13,719
absolutely not be in Big O of one but

1440
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,719
let's prove it anyway proof by

1441
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:24,280
induction let's do our base

1442
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:25,800
case n equals z so 2 to the 0o is in Big

1443
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,640
O of one

1444
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,159
that's just that's saying that one is

1445
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:34,000
Big O of one which it certainly

1446
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:34,000
is all right inductive

1447
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:47,840
step uh assume n is at least

1448
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:47,840
zero and that 2 to the N is in Big O of

1449
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:54,040
one want to show 2 the n + 1 is in Big O

1450
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:55,800
of

1451
01:11:54,040 --> 01:12:00,880
one but

1452
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:03,000
but well 2 the n + 1 that's 2 the n + 2

1453
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,000
the

1454
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:09,280
N which is Big O of one plus Big O of

1455
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:13,880
one by our inductive

1456
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:16,920
assumption and that is Big O of

1457
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,000
one so 2 the N plus one is Big O of one

1458
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:21,600
and we're

1459
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,600
done we proved our

1460
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,880
induction what the heck went wrong

1461
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:37,840
yes 2 the N plus 1 is not equal to 2 the

1462
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:41,600
N plus 2 the N um it is 2 the N plus 1

1463
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:43,719
is just 2 * 2 the N um which I can write

1464
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:47,280
as two copies of two to the UN added

1465
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:50,280
together um I will tell you the mistake

1466
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,159
isn't in this line at all I know I did

1467
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:55,560
something really sketchy right here what

1468
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:58,040
do I mean by o of one plus o of one

1469
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:01,480
that's a set and that's a set why am I

1470
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:03,840
able to add them also I accidentally Ed

1471
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,400
that when I meant set membership instead

1472
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,560
of

1473
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,800
equality but actually this is kind of

1474
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:11,920
fine this is an abusive notation we

1475
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:16,600
didn't really Define what this

1476
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:20,080
means but all we mean by it um o of f

1477
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:22,840
plus o of G this is just the set of

1478
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:29,960
functions um a plus

1479
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:29,960
b where a is in o of F and B is in O of

1480
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:35,040
G this just means the set of things you

1481
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,560
can form by taking a one function from

1482
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,120
this side and one function from that

1483
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:41,199
side and adding them

1484
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:43,159
together um and it is true that in this

1485
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:46,440
case o of one plus o of one equals o of

1486
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:51,040
one as sets so that's fine that's not

1487
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:51,040
the mistake yes

1488
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:02,199
all right um so let me reiterate um I

1489
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:04,800
proved that every number two to the N is

1490
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:08,440
Big O of one itself but I didn't prove

1491
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:11,080
the function 2 to the N is Big O of one

1492
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:16,080
that's exactly the idea so let's see

1493
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:16,080
what we actually proved here this

1494
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:24,080
here is a correct proof by

1495
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:27,159
induction but what is it proving it it's

1496
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,880
a proof of what we what we really proved

1497
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:32,639
is that two to the is is that one is in

1498
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:35,760
Big O of one that was our base case we

1499
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:38,880
proved that two is in Big O of one four

1500
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,840
is in Big O of one eight is in Big O of

1501
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,760
one 16 is in Big O of

1502
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:49,639
one we proved that each individual power

1503
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:53,520
of two when considered as a constant

1504
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:55,560
function is Big O of one so every

1505
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,159
constant function is Big O of one yeah

1506
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:00,719
that's true we proved it by induction

1507
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:03,520
that has absolutely nothing to do with

1508
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:06,159
the two to the N function has absolutely

1509
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,840
nothing to do with the definition of 2

1510
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:11,320
to the N being in Big O of

1511
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,560
one so we didn't prove the right theorem

1512
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:17,000
we proved something completely

1513
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:20,400
irrelevant does that make

1514
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,040
sense so this is why induction and

1515
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:26,679
astics don't mix when you see a function

1516
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:29,280
of n you can't break that function

1517
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:31,360
into individual constant functions one

1518
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,960
for each n value you can't induct on N

1519
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,280
you have to treat that function

1520
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,280
holistically as a single

1521
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:42,239
function sound

1522
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:46,760
good all right um does anyone have any

1523
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:46,760
questions about anything we talked about

1524
01:15:53,520 --> 01:16:01,840
yes excellent question does little o

1525
01:15:57,159 --> 01:16:03,520
imply Big O uh so if we know that f o

1526
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,239
sorry if we know that f is in little o

1527
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:09,520
of

1528
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:13,239
G does that imply that f is in Big O of

1529
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:16,080
G yeah yeah absolutely um and let's

1530
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:21,040
let's think about why this so little o

1531
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:25,480
is defined by uh let's see f um sorry F

1532
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:27,880
over G that limit equals zero

1533
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:29,400
but remember we already said early on

1534
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,560
that if the limit

1535
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:34,080
exists then it tells you whether or not

1536
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:37,520
it's Big O and in this case the limit is

1537
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:41,440
zero so it tells us yes we are Big

1538
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:45,239
O yep so little o is absolutely stronger

1539
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:47,159
than Big O it implies Big O um we we

1540
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:50,800
certainly don't go the other

1541
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:53,600
way um likewise

1542
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,040
um uh let's see there are lots of other

1543
01:16:53,600 --> 01:17:00,080
implications between this between these

1544
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:03,679
so um Theta if f is a Theta of G well

1545
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:07,000
that certainly implies Big O and big

1546
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:11,080
Omega because that's how we Define Theta

1547
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
and in turn these also imply little o

1548
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:15,760
and little

1549
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,360
Omega um because Big O implies little o

1550
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,920
as we just saw which means big Omega

1551
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,120
implies little Omega because we're just

1552
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,520
swapping the

1553
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,960
order uh so yeah so we have lots of

1554
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,280
implications like this um let me write

1555
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:31,040
it this

1556
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:32,320
way this implies little o and this

1557
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:37,480
implies little

1558
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:39,679
Omega uh and as we already saw ASM totic

1559
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:44,520
equivalence implies

1560
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:47,520
Theta which in turn implies all the

1561
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,520
others

1562
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,639
yes I got these arrows wrong thank you

1563
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,199
no

1564
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:57,920
I'm see I I shouldn't add live at the

1565
01:17:55,199 --> 01:18:00,440
board I'm always going to get it wrong

1566
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,000
um yeah I apologize Theta implies the

1567
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:05,480
big ones not the little ones um the

1568
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,080
little one implies the big one not the

1569
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:11,840
not the other way around sorry for the

1570
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,840
confusion um one more

1571
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:21,360
question all right thanks everyone we'll

1572
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,360
see you tomorrow at recitation
