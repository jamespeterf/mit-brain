00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,200
Hi, I'm Mark Lindseay and I'm a

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,960
cardiologist specializing in genetic

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,080
arterial disease at the Massachusetts

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,400
General Hospital.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,240
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Praep Nodarajin and I'm the

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
director of preventive cardiology and

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,320
genetics researcher at Mass General

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
Hospital and the Broad Institute of MIT

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
and Harvard.

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,960
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Tiffany Bellamo and I'm a

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,920
vascular surgery resident at the

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,920
Massachusetts General Hospital.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,920
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,760
or SCAD is defined as a tear or a

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,840
separation in the wall of the coronary

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,000
artery, but it's not associated with

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
athoscerosis or trauma. It's an

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,840
emergency health situation where blood

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
flow is slowed or obstructed that can

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,280
lead to a heart attack or sometimes even

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
sudden death.

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,160
>> SCAD has been known to affect men and

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,960
women. However, SCAD most commonly

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
affects women. SCAD patients are often

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,800
healthy and without risk factors of

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
heart disease such as high cholesterol

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,840
or diabetes.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,240
>> SCAD is a rare condition linked to

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
arterial fragility sometimes caused by

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
well-known genetic disorders like

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,280
vascular ellers stanlo syndrome, morphan

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,200
syndrome and loystein syndrome. These

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,040
conditions involve mutations that weaken

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,560
blood vessels and increase the risk of

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,799
arterial tears.

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,720
Researchers haven't yet found all the

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,119
genes that clearly increase the risk of

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,600
SCAD. We can increase the discovery of

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,840
genes associated with SCAD by collecting

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,840
health data and samples from larger and

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
more diverse patient groups. The

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,920
scarcity and unpredictable nature of

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
SCAD make it challenging to study. But

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,720
with the GVAS research study, we can

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,720
make significant progress.

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,799
>> GVAS is short for genetics of vascular

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,720
disease. This is a research study that

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
is designed to gather health information

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
from patients who have been diagnosed

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,799
with SCAD or other vascular

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,880
abnormalities. The study operates out of

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,920
Massachusetts General Hospital and the

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,719
Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Participation in the GVAS study includes

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,640
completing surveys online about your

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
health information and providing a

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,040
saliva sample which can be mailed to

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
your home. All information will be kept

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,760
confidential and in a secure database

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,920
and will never be sold for profit. GVAS

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,400
study staff and researchers abide by the

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,400
policies and guidelines instilled by the

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,440
Mass General Bighgam Institutional

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Review Board.

65
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,160
The GVAS study aims to perform the

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,879
largest sequencing project to date of

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,360
individuals with SCAD. We are working

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,840
together to create a research community

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,319
of individuals highly motivated to

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,560
investigate the genetics of SCAD and set

71
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,239
the foundation for future research. This

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,720
community is enhanced by the

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,000
contributions and partnership from the

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,840
ICAD registry and SCAD Alliance which

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,680
also aim to better understand and

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,599
support patients with SCAD.

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
>> We invite members of the SCAD community

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,560
to join the GBASK research study and

79
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
share it with others. Your partnership

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
will be key in understanding why SCAD

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
happens and how it can be prevented and

82
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,680
treated.
