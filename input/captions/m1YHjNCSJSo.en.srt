1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,919
uh great to be here I'm Dan Stack

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,960
co-founder and CEO of electri fire

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,880
thermal Solutions uh we're in MIT

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,480
spinout I was working here since 2014

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,679
under Dr Charles forsberg in the nuclear

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
energy department and we founded the

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,240
company to decarbonize energy uh

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,160
industry with electrified Heat and the

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,600
market pain point on its face is that if

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,400
you are an industrial of really of any

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,000
kind you're usually burning fossil fuels

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,880
and if you tried to get off of fossil

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,800
fuels to something zero carbon you will

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,760
find no affordable option um and there's

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,399
three main features to this challenge as

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,640
we see it the first one is that

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,320
electricity zero carbon electricity has

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,920
become quite cheap wind power solar

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,719
power are being deployed at record

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,239
numbers there's two counterpoints to

21
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,559
them however the first one is that

22
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,120
firming that energy is very expensive

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,840
that is storing it in a battery for

24
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,399
later you'll easily 10x the cost of that

25
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,760
energy if you want it firm and On Demand

26
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,519
the other challenge is that Industries

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,600
are used to heat generally speaking

28
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,559
their heat demands are what dominates

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,719
and even if you had a perfect battery it

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,439
doesn't put out high temperature heat

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,799
for your process it puts out electricity

32
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,720
so how do we take that zero carbon

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,000
electricity and make it into a firm heat

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,159
Source that's still affordable that's

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,759
what we've been doing at electrified

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,200
thermal we've been developing the jeel

37
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,600
hiive thermal battery and in essence it

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,479
is a box that sits on your industrial

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,000
site nearby and it takes in electricity

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,640
whenever it makes sense it could be from

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,720
solar power wind power nuclear Hydro or

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,600
just the grid with those energy sources

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,000
on it we take that electricity and we

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,040
put out high temperature 24/7 uh gas

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
high temperature air or other gases that

46
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,880
we flow into your furnace your boiler

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,720
your Kiln and we can do the job of

48
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,600
fossil fuels as we do that we can

49
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,560
deliver 1,800 Celsius we're at least

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,759
three times cheaper at least three times

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,119
cheaper than hydrogen um which

52
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,079
is kind of the de facto answer in a lot

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,719
of cases the less hydrogen you need the

54
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,039
happier you will be if you're trying to

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,920
decarbonize uh retrofittable we plug

56
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,840
into your process give you a pipe of

57
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,240
high temperature gas into your furnace

58
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,280
into your boiler into your Kiln so you

59
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,960
don't have to radically redesign what

60
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,119
you do to decarbonize what you do and

61
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,640
it's very modular we can build larger or

62
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,080
smaller boxes and we can put multiple on

63
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,560
a site and as I'll show later we also

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,680
have other form factors and our vision

65
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,560
is industry electrified by 2045 which is

66
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,200
roughly a$3 trillion Challenge and

67
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,360
opportunity this is what it takes to

68
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,239
transform our uh energy and Industrial

69
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,160
sectors uh this is what we spend on

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,040
fossil fuel today in these sectors and

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,879
so it's a massive undertaking but we are

72
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,720
aiming the juive thermal battery and the

73
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,440
juive technology to be the engine of the

74
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,519
future that has double digit um Global

75
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,040
percentages of energy flowing through it

76
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,560
by this time and what makes us different

77
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,360
than other approaches to electrified

78
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,080
Heating and thermal storage is roughly

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,280
10 years in the making mostly during my

80
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,599
time ATM which is the electrically

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,200
conductive fire brick and so as we got

82
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,080
to working on this problem back then we

83
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,120
came to understand that electric heaters

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
are the bottleneck if you want to

85
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Electrify industry electric heaters were

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,560
never designed to replace fossil fuels

87
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,840
and why would they be it didn't make

88
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,360
sense before and so what we did was we

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
looked at materials that can survive you

90
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,599
know other heaters they oxidize they

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,959
burn out they break down they don't last

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,400
long enough and they don't go hot enough

93
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,640
um and what we looked at was materials

94
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,879
that can take the heat can run at flame

95
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,599
temps for decades and so we developed

96
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,360
electrically conductive fire bricks I

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,840
have one here if you come by my booth

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,360
and give me a business card you can hold

99
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,000
it um um and we run electricity straight

100
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
through these bricks and heat them up to

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,040
Flame temperatures and so what you see

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,840
on the screen here is what's inside the

103
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,159
jewel Hive and it's full of these bricks

104
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,400
and regular fire bricks and they can

105
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,879
heat up the flame temps and when you

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,159
want the energy back out you just flow

107
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,200
air or other gases straight through the

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,640
brick chamber and it comes out hot it's

109
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,640
very simple and there's nothing here

110
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,519
that oxidizes burns out it breaks down

111
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,319
it can run at medium and high voltages

112
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,319
which is better for scale compared to

113
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,920
electric heating Technologies and so

114
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,280
we've checked the major boxes that we

115
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,120
see as the limiters

116
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
and we've been scaling up so I was here

117
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,159
I think it was two years ago now we've

118
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,599
made some big progress uh we've gone now

119
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,280
our first multi-ton batches of these

120
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,280
bricks this year they're very similar

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
98% similar to existing bricks so we've

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,079
worked with existing Supply chains

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,880
existing manufacturers to produce these

124
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,120
now whether you want two tons or 2,000

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,479
tons we can make the E bricks to scale

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,800
up our Tech and they're very similar to

127
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,960
what's used in the glass industry as an

128
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,320
example as far as actually piloting the

129
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,720
system we've gone from a few hundred

130
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,400
Watts now to several tens of kilowatts

131
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,600
in our elevator size box on the right so

132
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,960
the left is what we used to do the right

133
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,280
is what we do now you can see me

134
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,440
standing in there with some colleagues

135
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,840
and we've done uh cylic heating we've

136
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
put out it's hard to see here but you

137
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
can see the faint glow of the hot gas

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,960
coming out the back we've done cylic

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,080
high temperature gas flows we've also

140
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,120
done uh Direct Metals melting in the

141
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,560
bottom right you'll see where we loaded

142
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,600
metal in and does direct radiative

143
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,639
heating for Metals um a customer wanted

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,120
to see this and so our elevator size box

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,479
here we've been running this for about a

146
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,039
year now and what comes next is our

147
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,600
megawatt scale system um and so we'll be

148
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,400
deploying that early next year customer

149
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,600
sites the year after and we're talking

150
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,320
to folks that want steam generation uh

151
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,880
calcination uh any number of uh furnaces

152
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,800
that we're looking to hook up to and

153
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,919
deep

154
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,400
conversations and ultimately we'll be

155
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,319
scaling to the hundreds of megawatts so

156
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,720
we go with first to kind of container

157
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,039
size systems and then we go to megawatt

158
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,240
scale systems so we can uh service the

159
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,240
entire industrial uh sector final quick

160
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,360
point on economics can this save you

161
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,199
money yes and we can say that because

162
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,840
electricity prices are getting negative

163
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,960
uh increasingly so as we deploy solar

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,319
and wind power near zero dollar

165
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,280
electricity and this is just over the

166
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,600
last five years in the US and I think

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639
I'm out of time here so I'll jump to the

168
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,759
punchline that we can save you money is

169
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,479
a quick chart of just five sample

170
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,560
countries on the left of each of these

171
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,680
is our cost plus the cost of the jewel

172
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
Hive on the right is the natural gas

173
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,360
price and when we we run to these

174
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,319
different countries we can beat natural

175
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,520
gas prices now it's a widening envelope

176
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,840
of uh places where we can beat natural

177
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,560
gas because of these Trends so come talk

178
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,800
to me if you want to save money while

179
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,360
decarbonizing uh and reach out at uh
