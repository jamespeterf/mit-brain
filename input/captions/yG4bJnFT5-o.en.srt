1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,720
last time. One of the things we we did

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,720
were we proved two mean value

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,720
inequalities.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,199
So we proved two mean value inequality

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,199
and let me call those

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,120
And the first one was that. So if you

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:48,160
had a function f on some interval from a

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,160
to b into r and this function uh f is

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
differentiable.

10
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:04,960
Then it said that there exist some x0

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:09,200
with uh x0 between strictly between a

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:14,240
and b. So that the derivative

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,560
at x0 is equal to uh the average of the

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,520
function or the average of the function

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,640
at the end points. So this is the

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,200
average on the end points divide. So

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,080
it's it's average over the length of the

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,360
interval. So

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
so this is what the mean value theorem

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
said.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,159
And then there was a second mean value

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,680
theorem and that was the cush mean value

23
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,799
theorem.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,799
So the cushy bean museum

25
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,520
and that was where you had two functions

26
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,840
f and g

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,040
on this interval

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,520
into r and they are both assumed to be

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
differentiable.

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,040
And then again it was that there exist

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
some x0

32
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,760
strictly between

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,760
uh a and b.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,640
And uh if you take the derivative

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,440
uh at x0 of f

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,000
times the value

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,400
uh the difference in value of G at the

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,519
end points.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Then this is equal to the derivative of

40
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,440
G at X0

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,760
times the difference in value of F at

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,760
the end points.

43
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
Right? So that was the Kushim man

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
theorem. So it was a little bit more

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,879
complicated than the actual minium

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,360
because you had two functions at the

47
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,239
same time and the point here was that

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,440
you could arrange this x0 to work for

49
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,640
both points for both functions.

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,640
Let me just make an observation

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,120
that if um so if we're looking at so so

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,120
so

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,560
right so the cushim seems like a more

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,400
elaborate version of the mean value

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,920
theorem and it really is because if you

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,959
if you suppose that g here was the

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,080
function

58
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,480
uh that is equal to x. So g of x is

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,480
equal to x.

60
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,280
I have f here on the integral from a to

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,480
b.

62
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,480
This is again differentiable.

63
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,239
Well, if the other function was just

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,799
this sort of rather trivial function G,

65
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,560
of course, G is also differentiable and

66
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,239
we even know that the derivative of G at

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,759
all points is one, right? So if you are

68
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:25,000
now applying the cushy mean then it say

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,000
that by the cushy mean

70
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:43,040
right? there exist some x0

71
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:46,160
with uh x0 strictly between a and b

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,720
and so that the derivative of f so

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,440
that's whatever that is that's the

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,560
derivative of f at x0

75
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,360
the value of g at these two end points

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,880
where g is just a function x so this is

77
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,960
just b minus a

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:08,320
and the derivative of g is one

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,880
h and then it's the difference in value

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,720
of f at the end point

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,600
right and so now if you just divide by b

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,800
minus a so this of course imply that

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:27,280
frime of x0 is equal to f of b minus f

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:31,199
of a divided by b minus a. So in other

85
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,600
words and so you see this here gives you

86
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,240
uh this here gives you this the more

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
standard mean value inequalities. So in

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,000
other words, the cushive mean man

89
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,400
theorem is more general than the than

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
than this mean value inequality, right?

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,960
Because you recover this if you just let

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,160
one of the two functions be just a

93
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,160
trivial function x, right?

94
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Um

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,120
okay, so that was just an observation.

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,160
The second thing I want to talk about uh

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:12,160
is something we didn't get to uh last

98
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:16,919
time and this is uh this is this uh

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,919
op uh rule

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,360
and I'm just going to state one version

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,520
of it. There are two versions

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,880
and they're both in the notes but I will

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,000
just state one of them. Uh and so this

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,720
is so you have so the situation here is

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that you have two function uh f and g

106
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,479
uh and they are defined on some interval

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,560
say from a to b into r

108
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,520
uh uh the interval does not include the

109
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,520
end point. Okay, so these are

110
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,520
differentiable.

111
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Uh and then we assume that uh the limit

112
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:16,720
here we assume that g sorry uh of x is

113
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
uh and not only g of x but also g prime

114
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,280
of x

115
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,280
are not equal to zero for all

116
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
x.

117
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:36,560
And then we assume that the limit here

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:39,120
of g of x as x goes to a

119
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,919
that this here is zero. And the same

120
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,080
hold for the function

121
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,080
uh f.

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,599
So let's here

123
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,800
and then what you're interested in is

124
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,440
what you're interested in is that you're

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,759
interested in looking at uh f ofx

126
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,400
divided by g of x. Right? So this here

127
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,720
makes sense. g doesn't vanish. So this

128
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,319
here makes sense. And you are interested

129
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,319
in looking at this

130
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:18,080
fraction here

131
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:21,280
as x go to a right. If x go to a then

132
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,160
the denominator go to zero and the

133
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,479
nominator also go to zero right and the

134
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,039
question is does it has have a limit or

135
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,080
not right and so there's one more

136
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:37,680
assumption here that you need and that

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:41,320
is that um that if you're looking at the

138
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,320
Assume also

139
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,480
that uh that's the limit here uh as x go

140
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,600
to a

141
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,080
of frime of x / g prime assume that this

142
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399
here exist

143
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,880
[Applause]

144
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,880
and is equal to some l. Okay.

145
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,320
And then the claim is that then so the

146
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,320
claim here is

147
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:25,920
that the this fraction here f ofx / g of

148
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,160
x

149
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:35,320
that this does have a limit as x go to a

150
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,320
and that limit is is actually l.

151
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,360
So this is uh this is one version of of

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:48,120
of of this rule. Okay. And there's a

153
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,120
there's another one very similar.

154
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,519
Okay.

155
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:00,040
And so so we want to prove this. So uh

156
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,040
we looking at so

157
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,880
so we have we want to uh apply the

158
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,080
Kushim mean value theorem to to prove

159
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,240
this theorem and so we're looking at a

160
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,959
interval here.

161
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,040
Uh so you're looking at at uh say y. So

162
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,720
here you have

163
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,440
a

164
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,399
here you have uh x and then here you

165
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:34,200
have y and here you have b right and I'm

166
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,200
now going to apply so we will apply the

167
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:42,120
so apply

168
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,120
the kushimi value

169
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,839
But we are applying it on on this

170
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:02,240
interval here

171
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:05,360
between uh so so y here is less than x

172
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,959
but it's strictly bigger than a and this

173
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,480
is x is strictly less than than x right

174
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,160
so the function was differentiable on

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,760
this open interval. So of course it's

176
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,480
differentiable or both functions are

177
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:23,040
differentiable on this closed interval.

178
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:27,920
So we can apply it and so we get that uh

179
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:31,240
fprime at some intermediate point

180
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,240
uh x0

181
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:44,120
uh times uh g

182
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:44,120
of uh uh x minus g of y.

183
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,720
This is equal to g prime again x0 here

184
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,360
is like is some intermediate point in

185
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,480
lie between these two

186
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,200
uh g prime at x0

187
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:04,240
times uh f of x minus g of x g of y

188
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,160
sorry like that

189
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,120
right this is just uh applying the cushy

190
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,120
mean value

191
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Okay.

192
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,760
>> Uh what what did you say? Oh, yeah.

193
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Thanks.

194
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,120
Yeah. Thank you.

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,320
Right. And so now I just divide. Of

196
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,519
course, this here is supposed to be uh

197
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,680
non zero. So I can just divide.

198
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:41,040
Um so so we have that

199
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:44,560
uh that fprime of x0

200
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,560
divided by uh

201
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,600
by g prime of x0

202
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,399
and then I will I want to divide by this

203
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,200
but I just need to make sure that this

204
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,360
here is

205
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,440
um is

206
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,920
um

207
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,399
that I can divide by right that it's not

208
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,399
zero this thing here. So I have this

209
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:25,279
now think about X is being fixed and do

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,440
this for all Y. Right? If I do this, if

211
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:33,360
I do this for y where y is very very

212
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,000
close to a, this here becomes really

213
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,560
really close to zero. Right? This here

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,079
is fixed and it's it's not equal to

215
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,160
zero. Right? So this here is very close

216
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,040
to zero. This is not equal to zero. So

217
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,680
this here if y is really close if x is

218
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,240
fixed y is really close to a. This is

219
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,880
definitely not zero. Right? So I can

220
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,440
divide by it right.

221
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,199
So for

222
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,720
for x fixed

223
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,000
and

224
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,000
y sufficiently close

225
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,079
close to zero.

226
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:25,040
then you have then uh

227
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:28,639
then g of x minus g of y

228
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,480
is not equal to zero. Right? And so I

229
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,040
can so I get that uh fprime

230
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,160
at this intermediate point divided by g

231
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:45,760
prime at the same intermediate point is

232
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:48,480
equal to f ofx - f of y / g of x minus g

233
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,440
of y

234
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,839
and now you see that as y here goes to

235
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,199
zero right so x is fixed still as y goes

236
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,600
to sorry not to zero But to a this here

237
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,399
goes to zero by assumption. This here

238
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,160
goes to zero. So the whole thing goes to

239
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,120
f ofx

240
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,440
divided by g of x.

241
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:17,240
Right?

242
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,240
Now the thing is that if you

243
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,279
so this is for all x fixed

244
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:38,600
Right. So now if you if you

245
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,600
So now we want to use So now you since

246
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:47,279
uh fprime

247
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:51,759
at at say set divided by g prime at set

248
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:55,600
since this fraction here as set go to a

249
00:15:51,759 --> 00:16:00,480
this is assumed to go to l right. So

250
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,959
this means that that uh given

251
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,440
given epsilon greater than zero there

252
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,079
exist a delta

253
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:16,079
greater than zero. So that if uh if if

254
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:18,399
um set here is uh is less than a plus

255
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,399
delta

256
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,600
then this fraction here then f prime of

257
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:30,079
set minus g prime

258
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:33,199
of set is minus l

259
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,079
is less than epsilon.

260
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,199
Right?

261
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,800
So now coming back here

262
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:47,680
if you were starting with so this here

263
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:50,079
again was for all fixed x

264
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,320
right

265
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
uh you had this statement right and

266
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,440
again

267
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:02,000
uh x0 was between y and x right so now

268
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:08,199
if you so if

269
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,199
if this x here If x is

270
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,760
is delta close to the left end point of

271
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,559
the interval, right?

272
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,520
Then you would have that

273
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:29,280
x0, right? But x0 remember that x0 is

274
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,360
lying here, right? So since

275
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:39,039
x0 would lie here, this means that also

276
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:41,679
x0 here is uh white is is is

277
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,160
uh in this interval here,

278
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,799
right?

279
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:53,120
And so this means that this thing this

280
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:57,120
number here you get is is L with up to

281
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:02,240
some you know it's it's L up to some

282
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:07,120
error of like epsilon right

283
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,640
so this here is almost equal to L and so

284
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,440
this means that this limit here right is

285
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,039
almost equal to L within a error of

286
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,240
epsilon right okay so this proof this

287
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,640
version of the

288
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,480
rule and there's a second version and

289
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,160
that's in the notes but uh I'll skip it

290
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
actually for now just because you know

291
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,520
there was sort of from the last lecture

292
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,520
and it's very similar to this yeah

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,400
>> sorry why

294
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,919
Yeah. Okay. So this is because um

295
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,360
g

296
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:57,320
of x is for is supposed to be not equal

297
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,320
to x for all x.

298
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,240
Right? And now I'm fixing x. Okay? So

299
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,240
this here is non zero. Then I'm letting

300
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,880
y go to a but then this here goes to

301
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,960
zero by assumption.

302
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,080
Right? So you see that if you're fixing

303
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,280
X and you just take a Y sufficiently

304
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,919
close to A, then this denominator is

305
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,520
definitely not zero. Right? You really

306
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,840
want to let this you want to let Y goes

307
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,600
to A because then this here is

308
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,919
eliminated, right? This is not part of

309
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,640
the statement the G of Y, right? Okay.

310
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:41,919
And so again, as long as we started with

311
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:45,679
a x that was sufficiently close to if x

312
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,919
was in this interval, then x0 is even

313
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,760
further to the left. So this is also in

314
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,039
this interval. We don't know exactly

315
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,919
what x0 is, but it is in that interval.

316
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:59,400
And so this means that this is strictly

317
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,400
smaller than epsilon.

318
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,520
Okay. So,

319
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,760
another thing we talked about last time

320
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,520
was this with the tail expansion.

321
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,600
Uh,

322
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,160
and right and that all of these things

323
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,320
really came out of this uh bodice

324
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,960
theorem

325
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,960
uh and and and that was also the case

326
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,080
for the tail expansion.

327
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,000
So, you have a function f. So this is

328
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,000
just to remind you about the tail

329
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
expansion.

330
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:48,120
So you have a function

331
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,120
uh f

332
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
and let's say that is defined on some

333
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:58,240
interval here

334
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:01,880
into r and the function is so f here is

335
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,880
uh k times

336
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,320
differentiable

337
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,679
So this means that that fprime exist

338
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,120
fprime up to

339
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,120
the k derivative right. So they all

340
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
exist.

341
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Uh and then the

342
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:36,919
statement was so then you looked at the

343
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,919
k minus one this is the k minus one

344
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,159
tail polomium

345
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:56,320
and uh and it was given by that k minus

346
00:21:51,919 --> 00:22:01,679
one of x is equal to and now you're

347
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,720
summing here from i =0 to k minus one

348
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,799
and you take the i derivative this is

349
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:13,520
sorry this is the i derivative

350
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:16,480
uh of f and you do this in a and you

351
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:22,960
divide by a factorial and then you're

352
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:26,880
looking at uh at x - a to the power i

353
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,360
right So this was this was the k minus

354
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,360
one tail

355
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:41,760
and then uh the tail expansion

356
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:44,960
tail expansion just told you that uh

357
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,120
that um

358
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:53,600
that uh f here

359
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,960
at some x was equal to

360
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:02,480
uh p

361
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:05,360
k minus one it's tail up polinomial plus

362
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,960
and then this is what is usually

363
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,960
referred to as a remainder term

364
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,840
and this was uh the this looked very

365
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,480
similar to one of these terms. It was

366
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,480
the k derivative

367
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,159
of f but then it was evaluated at a

368
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,919
point c

369
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:40,799
uh divided by k factorial

370
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:44,080
time uh time um x minus

371
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:49,919
uh a to the power k

372
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:52,960
and c here was supposed to lie between a

373
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,799
and X.

374
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,480
Okay. So that was the this was the this

375
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:03,360
is the tail expansion theorem right

376
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,520
and and so the thing is that so why is

377
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,159
this so useful and it is extremely

378
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,320
useful uh in many different settings

379
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,880
also in much more general settings than

380
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,760
what I'm describing here and that is

381
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:21,279
because that if you take a function here

382
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,080
then um and it may be a very complicated

383
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:28,880
function but this tail expansion theorem

384
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:32,640
tells you that it is it is close to if

385
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,080
you want to evaluate it at some X

386
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,080
you can evaluate the tail polinom that's

387
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,240
after all just a polinomial so that's

388
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,240
easy to evaluate

389
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,799
and then you get within this remainder

390
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,840
term of the right answer okay so that's

391
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,960
how it always is used

392
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,919
and so the question is now the natural

393
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,679
question is how well does the tail

394
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,919
polomial

395
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:04,600
uh approximate

396
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,600
the value of the given function.

397
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Right? So, so how

398
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,320
well

399
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,320
does the tail upon

400
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,360
uh approximate

401
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,400
the the function.

402
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:43,760
Okay. and and of course to to um to

403
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,240
understand that you need to estimate the

404
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,039
remainder term. Let me write the

405
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,480
remainder term here. So this the

406
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,880
remainder term

407
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,159
um

408
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,679
right so the remainder term is

409
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:06,080
um so I write this here as uh so it

410
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,760
really depends on on on x also right but

411
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,880
I would just write it like this thing

412
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:15,360
here so by this I mean the k derivative

413
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:20,080
of f

414
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:24,000
in c divided by k factorial and then x

415
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,200
minus a to the power k.

416
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,039
So again it depends on really also on

417
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,760
it. Of course it depend on a but it also

418
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:35,279
depends on x right and it's this thing

419
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,760
here. The thing the the catch here is

420
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,720
that you don't really know what c is

421
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:46,400
right the only thing you know about c is

422
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:49,679
that c is lying between uh a and x. So

423
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,919
this is essentially all you need, all

424
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,919
you know

425
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,200
about C.

426
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,000
Okay.

427
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,559
So now let's look at some examples.

428
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,360
Let's look at two examples. So the the

429
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,960
first one is like a promising example

430
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,440
and the second one is much less

431
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,919
promising. Uh and so uh but and so the

432
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,320
thing is that that how well it

433
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,480
approximate really depends on the

434
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:32,159
function. Okay. But the first one is is

435
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,919
quite typical though example.

436
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:39,360
So suppose that the function f ofx is

437
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:46,240
the exponential function.

438
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:48,960
Um and then we have that the derivative

439
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,600
is just the exponential function itself.

440
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,799
So this means that if you take the

441
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,799
derivative k times

442
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,679
then you just get the function itself.

443
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,919
So this means that the k minus one

444
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,000
this means that a k minus one tail

445
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,240
polinomial

446
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,559
right this is just the value of the

447
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,600
function I'll just write it out here so

448
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:24,480
this is the value and now I do it uh I

449
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:26,880
do it for a equal to uh zero

450
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,120
and I'm assuming that b here so I'm

451
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,720
thinking about I will think about this

452
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,520
function here f ofx

453
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,200
uh on on the this function the

454
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,480
exponential function I'm going to sing

455
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,159
about it on the interval say from uh

456
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,159
minus1 to one

457
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,360
um

458
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,960
um into r maybe maybe I will maybe I'll

459
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:02,240
just take it from zero to one into r

460
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:06,799
Um okay so the and the tail polinomial

461
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:10,320
so I'm going to so so so the tailum one

462
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:14,399
also talk about that this

463
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,960
tail polinomium is expanded around a

464
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:22,120
okay so we talk about that the tail

465
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,120
polom so we talk about tail expansion

466
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,720
around

467
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:36,559
uh A. Okay. And this just refer to that

468
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,640
when when you plug in A here, well then

469
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,360
of course you have exact equality,

470
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,279
right? And that all of the derivative

471
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,919
are evaluated at A. Okay? So it's really

472
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:52,799
like the tail polom. It's only a good

473
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:55,200
approximation near A. Right? So I want

474
00:29:52,799 --> 00:30:00,240
now to tail expand

475
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,760
uh near uh the zero

476
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,720
and so um so right so the value here of

477
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,679
the function is one at zero the

478
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,399
derivative is right so it's the

479
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,480
derivative is also one because it's just

480
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:20,880
a function itself and so this is so you

481
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,679
get x and then you get the next Uh the

482
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:28,080
next uh element in the tail expansion is

483
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:31,679
x^2 / 2 + x^2

484
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:37,600
over 3 factorial

485
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:46,399
and then uh x 4 over 4 factorial etc up

486
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:50,640
to x ^ k minus one over u uh k minus one

487
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,159
factorial right so this is the a tail

488
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,320
expansion

489
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:59,840
or take k minus one tail polomial

490
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,240
uh around zero. Okay.

491
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,799
And so now if you're interested in

492
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,760
evaluating

493
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,360
p you want to say how well does this

494
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,679
here approximate

495
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,520
uh the original function the exponential

496
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,159
function. So you want to bound this

497
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,799
thing here right? So you want to have a

498
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:24,960
bound for that. Well the thing again is

499
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,960
that f ofx you know that f ofx is equal

500
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:33,200
to this tail polomial

501
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:37,200
and then plus this remainder term

502
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:42,240
right in the c right

503
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,919
now c again has to lie will c will lie

504
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,480
between

505
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:52,919
a and x. In this case a is zero.

506
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,919
So it means that c here.

507
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:02,320
So this means that here here c here is

508
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:06,480
between zero and x. Right?

509
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,120
And the remainder term here

510
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,360
this here was

511
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,880
was equal to that you took the k

512
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,880
derivative of the function. So in this

513
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,919
case the k derivative of the function is

514
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,000
the function itself. So this here is the

515
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:30,320
value of the k derivative and this is uh

516
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,880
at c this is the k derivative of the

517
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,240
original function and then you have to

518
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,159
divide by a k factorial and then it's x

519
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,200
to the power

520
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,279
uh k like that

521
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,600
right

522
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:51,039
and so you see that if if x here is now

523
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,880
between zero and one. This means that

524
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:58,080
this thing here, this

525
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,880
remainder term here, the absolute value

526
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,600
is so c here is less than one. So this

527
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:10,720
means that this thing here is less than

528
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:14,960
e. So it's less or equal to e divided by

529
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,120
k factorial. This here is bounded by

530
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,880
since x is bounded by one, this is

531
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,840
bounded by one. So you're getting this

532
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,679
inequality here, right? And so you see

533
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,399
that if K is is very large, this is a

534
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,480
tiny number, right? So it's a really

535
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,799
good approximation. I mean, you don't

536
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,039
even need to make K very large because

537
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,640
it's exponential, right? Not

538
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,640
exponential, it's factorial. Yeah.

539
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Right.

540
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,279
Okay. So that's a kind of encouraging

541
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,240
example. Let's say that the the tail

542
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,399
expansion uh is is a very in this case

543
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,240
is a very good approximation to the

544
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,760
function.

545
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,120
Uh the another example that is less

546
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,760
encouraging and so again the moral is

547
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,000
that how well the tail expansion

548
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,880
approximate the function depend on the

549
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,720
function. So suppose that the function

550
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,599
here was

551
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,200
uh was a function that was zero here.

552
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:23,599
When x is less than zero less or equal

553
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:28,639
to zero and when x is bigger than zero

554
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:33,679
then it is e to the minus 1 /x^2.

555
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:36,240
Okay. So you see that when x becomes

556
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,200
very very small

557
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,119
you are looking at one over this

558
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,520
squared. So this here is huge

559
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,119
right but now it's with a minus sign. So

560
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,399
this means that this thing here is

561
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,399
incredibly small right and so it's

562
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,760
clearly it's clear that this function

563
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,320
here is continuous at zero. It's clearly

564
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,839
continuous everywhere else. But actually

565
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,800
it's you know sort of using in this sort

566
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,920
of argument it's easy to see that this

567
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,839
function f here is uh infinite

568
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,520
differentiable.

569
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,560
So it's you can differentiate it

570
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,560
infinitely many times and even at zero.

571
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Okay.

572
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,280
and and by it and of course the

573
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,480
derivative

574
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,160
uh the derivative is right so it's an

575
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,320
example of a function that looks like

576
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,839
this is zero until zero and then it goes

577
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,920
up like this right and so the derivative

578
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,880
at zero

579
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,720
is zero any derivative however many

580
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,480
times you take the derivative of this

581
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,079
function

582
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,160
sorry

583
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,960
this thing here

584
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,640
if you take any derivative and you

585
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,640
evaluate at zero, you always get zero,

586
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,640
right?

587
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,320
So, so this means that if you're looking

588
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,320
at the tail expansion

589
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:16,839
at zero, so you're looking at this k

590
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,839
minus one tailor polomial.

591
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,839
This polomial is all of the coefficient

592
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,880
in the polinomial are zero right. So

593
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,800
this polinomial is just zero. So this

594
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,440
means that

595
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,359
if you're looking at

596
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,160
f ofx

597
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:38,160
well f of x is actually equal to this

598
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,240
remainder term right. So it's somehow

599
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,320
you know the teleport number is like too

600
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,960
trivial. It doesn't really help you all

601
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,320
that much. Right? So it's equal to this

602
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,000
remainder term.

603
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
Okay.

604
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,079
Yeah.

605
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,240
>> Is there a way of um so like the

606
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,200
remainder like bounding this helps us

607
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,040
figure out how well the expansion

608
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,320
approximates the actual function. Is

609
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,480
there a way to determine like how far

610
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,800
from the point you're approximating like

611
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,520
a or zero in this case you can go a

612
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,920
>> Yeah. by it. That's right. I mean, so

613
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,839
you're asking, right? So you're asking

614
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,800
suppose and you definitely could do

615
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,040
this, right? You you asking

616
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,280
you you you're thinking that you have

617
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,119
you have a

618
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,720
you you you're thinking a slightly

619
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,320
different situation than here but

620
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,240
closely related that you have some a

621
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,560
here

622
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:43,359
and you have a function f and and you

623
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:46,800
want to and you are willing to maybe uh

624
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:50,240
look at you're willing to

625
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,920
take some fixed large k and then you're

626
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,280
asking

627
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:59,119
um what I'm interested in how well does

628
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,839
this how well does this function this

629
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,280
polomial approximate this but I want it

630
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,680
within an error certain area right so

631
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,640
it's a given epsilon and you're

632
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,440
interested in how far away can you go

633
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,280
from a so that this here is less than

634
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,839
epsilon and so this is so so this

635
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,240
becomes a question of this remainder

636
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,240
term, right? So this becomes a question

637
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,400
of this remainder term. When can you

638
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,720
always say that this remainder term is

639
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,119
less than epsilon

640
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,880
and so like in this particular you would

641
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,359
have to do it on a casebyase basis. Uh

642
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,640
but in this particular case the

643
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:44,000
remainder term is right if this interval

644
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:47,200
here in the in that example over there

645
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,599
if if you if you have here zero this was

646
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,720
a in our example and then you want to go

647
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,240
out here to some x

648
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,240
and now you know that c here is between

649
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,359
zero and x but you don't really know

650
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,480
anything else right so then it's like

651
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,520
this remainder term you will have this

652
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,280
remainder term in this example

653
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:18,440
uh at this c here this again was equal

654
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,440
to this thing here over k factorial

655
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,520
and so you would have that you would

656
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,320
want this thing here

657
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,000
r k

658
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,320
you would want this to be less than

659
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,280
epsilon and so you would have that this

660
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,839
thing here the the only the only thing

661
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,560
you can really do is that you can say

662
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,560
that C is less or equal to to X for C.

663
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,240
>> Yeah, that's right. But that no so so

664
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:51,280
you would do so what you would do here

665
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:54,880
is you would say R K C this here has to

666
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,839
be bounded by by because XC is less than

667
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,200
X. So this is E to the X you have to

668
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:06,160
eliminate C. So, so, so you would do

669
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:09,359
like this k factorial * x ^ k you have

670
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,839
to eliminate uh c right because you

671
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,800
don't know anything really about c and

672
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,760
so this here now has to be less than

673
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,560
epsilon so now you only have you know

674
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,240
you have fixed your k and so now you

675
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,800
only have one variable and you can solve

676
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,680
that but you you you really have to

677
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,680
eliminate change yeah

678
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:35,280
uh Okay.

679
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,160
Uh so so so again so so the how well the

680
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,920
tail expansion approximate depends on

681
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,839
the function.

682
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,640
Okay. The next topic is another

683
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,280
important topic and so this is uh

684
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,079
integrals

685
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,119
and there are

686
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:58,280
different ways of

687
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,280
of um defining integrals.

688
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,960
This here is

689
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,960
um

690
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,240
this here is certainly one of the maybe

691
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,760
the most natural one.

692
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,079
Uh and so this is what's called

693
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,960
reman. So it's after German

694
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,119
mathematicians reman

695
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,119
uh integrals.

696
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,520
And so the thing is that here now you

697
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,599
look at a function

698
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,839
you have a function on some interval

699
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:42,240
from a to b

700
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:45,240
into r and this function f here is um is

701
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,240
bounded

702
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,319
and the idea is so the idea is for

703
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,319
integrals is

704
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,160
that so you have a function function

705
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:05,160
and you want to be able to define. So

706
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,160
define

707
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,359
uh area

708
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,599
below

709
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,599
graph.

710
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,319
So so if this is a function you want to

711
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,680
be able to calculate

712
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,680
what is this area. Okay. Now, if the

713
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,599
function was to if the function was to

714
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,440
have crossed

715
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:40,079
um the x-axis, then this area here would

716
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,200
count negatively and this area here

717
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:47,119
would count positively. Anyway, so this

718
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,880
is this is what you want to do

719
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,920
and and you always starting with a

720
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:56,079
bounded function.

721
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,359
Now, to do that, right? And so so you

722
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:04,359
want to define that the only thing that

723
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,359
you know for sure is

724
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,880
so so there's only like one ingredient

725
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,880
you have.

726
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,119
So,

727
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:22,440
so only

728
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,440
only thing

729
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:29,079
uh no you know

730
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,079
at the outset.

731
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,480
So the only thing you know is that if

732
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,880
you take a right angle so if this length

733
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,280
here is

734
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:46,400
um uh is let's call it D and this here

735
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,400
is E right then you know that the area

736
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,800
here

737
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,800
so area

738
00:43:52,720 --> 00:44:01,119
is D * E right okay that's that's the

739
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:04,960
only thing we have so Now

740
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:08,720
how do we define the the area below the

741
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:12,680
graph? And to do that we first need to

742
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,680
talk about partitions.

743
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,480
So partition.

744
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,760
So suppose I have a

745
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,800
interval here. A and b are real numbers.

746
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,359
So I have an interval here. Then I talk

747
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,359
about a partition

748
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:46,880
and and it's useful to have a notation

749
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:50,240
for a partition. So I call it P of of

750
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:55,079
this interval here.

751
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,079
This is finite is finally many

752
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,200
many dividing points

753
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,200
and the dividing points always have to

754
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,720
start at A and end at B. So you have

755
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,480
finally many let's say k many and you're

756
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:22,400
looking at okay take I'll write it k +

757
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,359
one many. So uh the first one has to be

758
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,520
a

759
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:33,119
and then you have uh x1

760
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:36,160
up to the last one

761
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,079
and that has to be b.

762
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,920
Okay.

763
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,960
And so

764
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:47,119
so what you're thinking about is so you

765
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:51,119
have this interval here from a to b and

766
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:54,720
you have these dividing points

767
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,839
and you are thinking about dividing the

768
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,319
the original interval into these sub

769
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:05,079
intervals. Right? So these are the sub

770
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,079
intervals. Right? So you divide

771
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,920
the original

772
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,720
interval

773
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,240
into

774
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,240
sub intervals

775
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:31,200
and the sub intervals are I'll do it

776
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,760
like this. I will do it the where I take

777
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,800
from it's always from you know one to

778
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,280
the next and I will write it typically

779
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,359
where I'm starting where I'm ending at I

780
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,359
and beginning at I minus one.

781
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,079
So

782
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:51,359
right so I'm dividing it into these sub

783
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,079
intervals and so in this case here in

784
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,800
this case here where this is x0

785
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:01,280
uh there's going to be

786
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,200
uh k uh sub intervals okay and it's you

787
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,960
know you only

788
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,800
always go from one to the next right so

789
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,119
so that's a partition

790
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,359
and now we need a second notion

791
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,359
related to this and this is a sub

792
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,359
partition.

793
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,319
So subartetition

794
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,200
subartetition this is also sometime

795
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,200
called uh sometimes called

796
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,960
uh

797
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,960
refinement.

798
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,560
So a sub partition is so if you have a

799
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,560
partition so P1 is a partition

800
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,800
and then P2 is a sub partition of

801
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,800
refinement.

802
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,200
If if

803
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,480
P2

804
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:14,280
has all

805
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,280
the dividing points

806
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:27,280
of P1 and then some and then some I mean

807
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:30,720
it right right I mean of course it could

808
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:34,319
be a trivial sub partition where P1 and

809
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,920
P2 are the same. That's okay. But in

810
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:40,520
general, it would have some more points

811
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,520
also, some more dividing points. Okay.

812
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,920
Now,

813
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:52,800
um, right. So, now let me look at uh, so

814
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,240
what is then?

815
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,680
So, so now let's try to get closer to

816
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,920
try to define this with the area below

817
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,920
the graph.

818
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,200
Okay.

819
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:17,359
So again we have we have a function f

820
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:21,760
from a to b

821
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:25,160
into r. We assume that this is so uh

822
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,160
that is bounded.

823
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,960
We have P here is a partition

824
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,599
of of this interval here.

825
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:50,680
Then we defined a upper and a lower sum.

826
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,680
Then we define

827
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:00,280
upper

828
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,280
and lower sums.

829
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,319
as follows

830
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,280
right so again you have a given function

831
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,680
that is bounded and you have a partition

832
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,319
and so we define upper and lower sums

833
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:19,520
and the upper and lower sum I will

834
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:22,000
denote like this it depends on the

835
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,359
function of course and then on the

836
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,079
partition that's a upper sum and the

837
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:31,079
lower sum similar I would denote like

838
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,079
this

839
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,880
and so how are these defined?

840
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,880
So they are defined as follow

841
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:50,800
that you have here you have your

842
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:54,720
interval from a to b.

843
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:58,559
Then you have this here is x0 here I

844
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:03,559
have x1 and here I have maybe x2 and

845
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,559
then this thing here is then x3.

846
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,000
So I take uh I look at one of these

847
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,480
intervals

848
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,520
or it could be this one here. that's

849
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:19,680
between in this case it would be between

850
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,559
uh x1 and x2

851
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,559
and I would look at the function in this

852
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:29,040
interval here and I would so the

853
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,240
contribution from this here would be

854
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,160
that I would take so for the upper for

855
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,160
the upper

856
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,240
sum

857
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,119
with respect to this partition the one

858
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,599
that comes from this sub interval here

859
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:47,760
would be um would be

860
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:53,640
uh the soup

861
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,640
of f on this sub interval here.

862
00:51:53,680 --> 00:52:01,640
So the soup of the function

863
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,640
times the length of the interval

864
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,480
like that. So this would be the value

865
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,400
that in the upper that would come uh in

866
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,800
a minute I'll write it out more more

867
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,839
clearly but this would be what is coming

868
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:19,280
from here and likewise

869
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:22,000
uh for the lower one

870
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:28,280
um the contribution from this little

871
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,280
interval here would be the in of f

872
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:38,400
and then times and The idea right is

873
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:44,680
okay. So that would be the contribution.

874
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,680
Um the idea of course is that you have

875
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,240
but the only thing we knew was this with

876
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,520
the area of a right angle.

877
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,359
Right?

878
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:02,640
And so you have this function here and

879
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:07,440
you have some little interval here

880
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:10,880
between x i and x i - uh sorry x i - one

881
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,880
and x i right

882
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,440
and you're focusing on this little

883
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,880
interval here

884
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,359
and you're looking at the function the

885
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:23,760
function was bounded so there is a soup

886
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:27,200
on this and you try to look at the

887
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:30,880
smallest red angle angle that kind of

888
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:34,559
have the graph that fits where the graph

889
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,520
fits inside that right and then you're

890
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,440
looking at so this this is the

891
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,079
contribution

892
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:46,800
from this little interval

893
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:50,720
to P to to the upper sum and then you

894
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:54,079
have right that you're looking at the

895
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,800
largest right angle like this that fits

896
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:00,880
under the graph and that's then

897
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,000
contribution to the lower one.

898
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,240
Right? And the idea is that if the

899
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,240
function is reasonable, if you're

900
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,319
looking at finer and finer partition,

901
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,559
then you should you should certainly get

902
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,720
a better a better approximation to the

903
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,359
area below the graph, right? I mean, and

904
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,760
and and if the function is reasonable,

905
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:24,160
these two Okay, so now what is then the

906
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,839
uh let me just define this.

907
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:31,359
So this thing here

908
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:35,040
it would be convenient to to the length

909
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:39,200
of this interval to denote it by by

910
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:42,480
this. So this is x i x i minus one. This

911
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:46,079
just the length of that interval.

912
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:50,160
Okay. And so now written out this thing

913
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:59,040
and okay let me make one other notation.

914
00:54:50,160 --> 00:55:03,760
MI is the soup of f on x i minus one x i

915
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:08,119
that's m capital mi and little mi is

916
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,119
then the in on the same interval

917
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:20,160
like that. And so the upper sum

918
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:25,760
for this partition this is the sum from

919
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:30,319
i = uh one to k

920
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:36,480
of m i * delta xi.

921
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:39,359
That's the upper sum. And the lower sum

922
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:46,960
is then the sum

923
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:50,000
from i = 1 to k of mi delta xi.

924
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:53,040
Okay. So that's the upper and the lower

925
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,960
sum. Okay. The first thing you observe

926
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:00,319
is the first thing you observe is is a

927
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,480
trivial fact

928
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,200
and it's you know that really should be

929
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,559
the case because one is like what fits

930
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,960
inside the graph uh below the graph the

931
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:13,359
other is you know where the graph fits

932
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,280
below the right angle. So you clearly

933
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:17,839
have just be and this is just because

934
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,920
this number here is the in this is the

935
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,599
soup on the same interval. So you

936
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,359
clearly have

937
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:29,839
that uh L F

938
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:32,839
is less or equal to U FP. Right? So this

939
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,839
is

940
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,319
so this is clear. Right?

941
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,760
Okay.

942
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:48,599
Let's look at uh

943
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,599
let's look at an a couple of examples.

944
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,079
So just to make sure that this is

945
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:00,839
totally clear

946
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,839
uh let me look at a couple example.

947
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:07,799
So uh

948
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,799
the um

949
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,359
the first example is so I take a

950
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:21,960
function

951
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:21,960
f ofx = 2x^2 + 1

952
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,040
and my partition and the interval here

953
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,799
I'm going to think about this as a

954
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:33,760
function on minus2 two

955
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:36,400
to two

956
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,119
into R.

957
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:48,400
And my partition here

958
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:52,880
is going to be min -2 -1 0 1 and two

959
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:56,000
um and um right and so you have so let's

960
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,760
see so this so this here so if I draw

961
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,160
the function

962
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,839
then this is looks like if this here is

963
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,760
one

964
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:08,160
uh here you have one

965
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:12,079
then it looks sort of like this. Uh

966
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,960
doesn't more or less like this.

967
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,240
Okay. And so this means that here and

968
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:22,559
here you have two

969
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,040
uh and this here is minus one

970
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:28,040
um and

971
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,040
um

972
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:37,599
and uh and here you have uh minus two.

973
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,280
So now if you're looking at so that the

974
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:44,079
um right so so this means here that so

975
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:48,720
this is my partition so this means that

976
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:53,760
x0 is uh equal to minus2

977
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:56,640
x1 that's the next one is minus one x3

978
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,839
is the next one

979
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:06,079
that's zero x4

980
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:09,359
is uh one and x5 y is two, right? And so

981
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:11,280
of course all of these intervals here,

982
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:17,119
right? They all have the same length in

983
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:21,200
this case. So x i - x i -1. This was

984
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:25,720
what we call delta x i. This here is for

985
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,720
each of these is equal to one.

986
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,119
And now we have that the

987
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:47,680
and we have that the

988
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:50,960
when you're looking between minus2 and

989
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,839
two and sorry minus2 and minus one. So

990
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,480
on this interval here

991
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,960
um the function is the function on this

992
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,319
interval here is decreasing. So the

993
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:08,920
largest value is achieved at this point

994
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,920
here. Right? Uh so uh m

995
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:17,359
M1 this is the same as a soup of f

996
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:22,319
between uh x0

997
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:28,880
and x1. And so this is the same as the

998
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:31,599
soup of minus2 to minus1 right of f and

999
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,920
the function was decreasing so the li on

1000
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,799
this interval so the largest value is

1001
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:40,880
achieved here and that's five

1002
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:44,960
right so this would be five

1003
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:48,559
and uh on the second interval here

1004
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,119
right so this is between minus1 and zero

1005
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:54,319
still decreasing So the value is the

1006
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:58,960
largest value is here where it's two. So

1007
01:00:54,319 --> 01:01:03,119
this here is is two and m3

1008
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,200
this is now uh between zero and one. So

1009
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:09,680
now it's increasing. So the large value

1010
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:13,520
is over here. So that's again two.

1011
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:16,480
And then the last one is is is again

1012
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:20,880
five. Right?

1013
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:26,240
And then likewise for the the the ones

1014
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:28,799
that are the info. So the first one m1

1015
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,920
well the function was decreasing. So the

1016
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:34,640
smallest value is over at this end point

1017
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,680
there. The value is true.

1018
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,200
So you're getting uh this here is is

1019
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,319
two.

1020
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:45,839
And then between

1021
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:48,559
between minus1 and zero it's still

1022
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:54,200
decreasing. So there the smallest is at

1023
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:54,200
this point where it's one. So this is m2

1024
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:02,559
and then m3

1025
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:05,040
this is now here the function is

1026
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:08,400
increasing. So it's still the value

1027
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:11,200
here. So it's still one. And then the

1028
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:15,119
last one

1029
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:17,599
um is between one and two and there it's

1030
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,720
the infreom is the value here. So that's

1031
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,720
two right

1032
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,119
and so you see that in this case the

1033
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,280
upper

1034
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,839
for this function

1035
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:35,280
uh for this partition

1036
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:37,119
it's this right all of the intervals

1037
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,760
have length these small interval have

1038
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:44,400
length one so it's just the sum of these

1039
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:46,799
guys right so this is just equal to five

1040
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:53,920
if you will it's 5 * 1 that was length

1041
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:57,040
of the interval plus 2 * 1 + uh 2 * 1 +

1042
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:02,319
5 * 1. So in other words, you get here

1043
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:06,079
14. And for the lower ones,

1044
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:08,720
it's again this time I want rise times

1045
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:12,400
one. It's a sum of those guys and that's

1046
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:17,599
actually six, right?

1047
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:24,000
So So that's upper and lower sum. Okay.

1048
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:26,880
Now, uh and we had we had one um one

1049
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,079
observation that was a an immediate

1050
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,480
observation and that was uh this thing

1051
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,480
here.

1052
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,480
Now,

1053
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:43,359
what is useful is that you starting with

1054
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:47,440
a partition and then you you have a

1055
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:50,720
subartition. So the next one is so I

1056
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:56,440
take a function f on some interval from

1057
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,440
a to b and this function here is bounded

1058
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:04,200
and then I have p is a partition p1 say

1059
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:04,200
is a partition

1060
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,799
and then p2

1061
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,799
is a sub partition.

1062
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,720
of P1.

1063
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:23,160
And now the thing that is uh useful is

1064
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:26,300
the following.

1065
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,300
[Applause]

1066
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,599
that. So,

1067
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:46,599
so the following claim, the following

1068
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,599
leham

1069
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:58,000
that if you take a sub partition then I

1070
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:02,079
claim that the value of the upper sum go

1071
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:08,079
down and the value of the lower go up.

1072
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:11,920
So this is the following. So uh so lower

1073
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:16,160
of f * p1.

1074
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:19,680
This is less or equal to the lower of f

1075
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:22,160
of p2. We already proved that this thing

1076
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,839
here, this one here, this this

1077
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,640
inequality we haven't proved yet. But

1078
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:28,480
this one here, we have that this is less

1079
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,240
than

1080
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,280
than the upper one for the same

1081
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:36,240
partition. And the second claim is that

1082
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,920
this here is then less than the upper

1083
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,440
one for the first.

1084
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Okay.

1085
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,880
Now why is this the case? This is also

1086
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,920
actually a trivial statement but it's

1087
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:53,200
very useful statement.

1088
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:56,880
So imagine that you have your partition

1089
01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:00,880
P1 here and then you have the dividing

1090
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:03,520
points I minus one

1091
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:07,039
and here you have I

1092
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:10,000
right and P2 is a sub partition. So

1093
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,160
there may be intervals like this where

1094
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,880
there are no further dividing points

1095
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:17,280
right but in that case the what you the

1096
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,160
contribution that for the lower and

1097
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:24,799
upper is the same for the two partitions

1098
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:28,319
right but should there be one or more

1099
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:32,319
let's just say there's one right then

1100
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:35,039
for the upper one you would look at you

1101
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:40,000
would then get so you would get a a a

1102
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:42,720
new dividing point. Let's call it y.

1103
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,559
And then you would get for the new one,

1104
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:48,240
you would have you would look at the

1105
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:50,480
soup here on this interval here, right?

1106
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:53,039
But the soup on this interval here of

1107
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,559
the function is less than the soup on

1108
01:06:53,039 --> 01:07:04,079
the larger interval. So you would get a

1109
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:06,240
soup of f on the interval from i -1 to y

1110
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,039
of f

1111
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:11,119
you get that and then you would get

1112
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:15,200
times the length of the interval that's

1113
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:18,799
y - x i -1

1114
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:25,920
and then you would get a second soup but

1115
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:28,480
this is now from from y to x I of f and

1116
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,119
then you would have multiple by the

1117
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:38,160
length of this interval. So this is this

1118
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:40,799
here is then from x i to y. Okay.

1119
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:44,400
So this is this is what you get from the

1120
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:47,119
new petition. the contribution from the

1121
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,680
from the second

1122
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:53,119
from the this is what this is the

1123
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:59,760
contribution that you get from the upper

1124
01:07:53,119 --> 01:08:03,200
sum for this partition P2 from this part

1125
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:06,960
right but now you see that this thing

1126
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:09,039
here the soup over this little interval

1127
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:12,160
well that of course is less than the

1128
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:15,599
soup over the larger interval so This is

1129
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,759
less than m i and I just keep this one

1130
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:21,040
here

1131
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:23,759
and this one here is also a sub interval

1132
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:30,640
of this larger interval. So this is less

1133
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:34,080
than m i again time x i - x y.

1134
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,560
But now you can factor out the mi. So

1135
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:42,480
you're getting MI and you're getting the

1136
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:46,560
sum of these two Y - X I - one +

1137
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:53,600
uh X I - Y. And so you see that this

1138
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:55,040
here is exactly MI * X I - X I - one.

1139
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,000
Right?

1140
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:01,920
And so you see that the

1141
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:06,799
contribution that we get here to the

1142
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:11,040
upper sum from this part here

1143
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:13,520
that was this and this those two things

1144
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,279
this is less than the contribution we

1145
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,440
get from the upper sum from the first

1146
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:22,560
partition. Right? And so this prove this

1147
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:25,839
proves this inequality here

1148
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:30,000
and this inequality is just similar.

1149
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:32,400
It's just with the instead of the soups.

1150
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,799
Okay. So this is this is a this is like

1151
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,920
a key point. It's a you know each of

1152
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:40,640
these steps is like completely trivial.

1153
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,719
Uh but together it it actually means

1154
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,440
that you can really define something

1155
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:49,359
non-trivial.

1156
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:52,159
Okay. So now um and this may seem

1157
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:56,719
cheating. Now we uh well first of all we

1158
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:59,520
define the upper and lower integrals.

1159
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:04,280
So we have upper and lower sum and now

1160
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,280
we define the upper and lower intervals.

1161
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,360
So our

1162
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,719
and lower instruments.

1163
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:39,520
Okay. Um so the upper lower integral so

1164
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:43,280
the upper here is denoted like this.

1165
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:46,000
We take a bar over this and this is the

1166
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,960
upper lower integral. So this is the

1167
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,360
integral. This is the function. And then

1168
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,480
you write this.

1169
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,960
And so this is simply defined to be the

1170
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,199
info

1171
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,640
over all partitions

1172
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:05,840
of the upper integral

1173
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,400
upper sum. Sorry.

1174
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:12,480
Right. And so remember again that if you

1175
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:14,560
take a partition and you refined it, if

1176
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,120
you're looking at a subartition of the

1177
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,440
given partition, then this number here

1178
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,000
goes down, right? I mean it may stay the

1179
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:25,600
same, but it's certainly not bigger,

1180
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,880
right? So so this is so so the idea here

1181
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:31,280
is that essentially this number here you

1182
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:35,280
get by looking at finer and finer

1183
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:37,520
partition, right? So idea

1184
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:41,600
is that

1185
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:43,679
uh the infirmum uh that this is that

1186
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,960
this

1187
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:52,360
is a limit

1188
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,360
over finer and final partition.

1189
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:04,400
Right? So that's the idea sort of the

1190
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:07,440
the but the precise statement is is is

1191
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,920
that it's just the info right. So this

1192
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:14,199
is the upper integral and then likewise

1193
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,199
we define the lower integral

1194
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,640
>> asset

1195
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,280
many

1196
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,280
obviously

1197
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:28,000
>> right there it's it's not you know but

1198
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,480
there is a a key assumption is that we

1199
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,280
that for each partitions there are only

1200
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:36,800
finitely many divisions

1201
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:39,040
but there's not a but it's but but there

1202
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,320
are infinite many partitions. So it's

1203
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:45,920
really and so so when I say that it's a

1204
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,760
limit over uh finer and finer partitions

1205
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,440
you should really think about that in

1206
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,360
sort of quotation mark this not very

1207
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,640
precise statements okay so but the

1208
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,000
precise statement is just that it's

1209
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:58,880
infome all partitions

1210
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,880
and so

1211
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,880
so

1212
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:08,000
I mean you can make that precise but

1213
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:10,800
then that require a lot of stuff uh that

1214
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,320
we don't want to do here. Uh and there's

1215
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:16,400
no reason to it because there's a

1216
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:18,800
perfectly reasonable way of defining it.

1217
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:22,600
And so that was the upper integral. So

1218
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,600
this is the upper integral.

1219
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,280
And then similarly the lower integral

1220
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:41,239
the lower integral. And there I'm just

1221
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,239
putting the bar below.

1222
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:48,080
And you refine it like this.

1223
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,239
And this is now the soup, right? Because

1224
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,880
remember that if you took a partition

1225
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:56,080
and then you take a sub partition, then

1226
01:13:52,880 --> 01:14:02,679
this lower sum actually went up. So it's

1227
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:02,679
a soup of all partitions of these lower

1228
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:13,440
Okay.

1229
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:16,960
Right. And so now we say that uh and

1230
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:20,239
then we say that

1231
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,760
so now here's the the definition. And

1232
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:29,360
again this may initially seem like kind

1233
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:32,000
of we are uh wimping out uh because but

1234
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,800
but but it but in a minute we will then

1235
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,199
determine when this is the case. So we

1236
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:43,400
define so so f here. So if you have a

1237
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:43,400
bounded function like this

1238
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,800
then we say that

1239
01:14:52,400 --> 01:15:01,320
that uh f is reman integral.

1240
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,320
So

1241
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,520
if uh if the lower sum

1242
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,880
is equal to the upper sum.

1243
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,719
So if this has the case

1244
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:39,040
um and and uh and and in that case

1245
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,840
and then

1246
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,840
the reman integral

1247
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:55,440
is this this common uh so the reman is

1248
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,440
written like

1249
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:02,679
And this is just

1250
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,679
this this common value.

1251
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:15,440
Okay.

1252
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:17,840
Now, uh one thing I just want to remark

1253
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,640
um is

1254
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:24,400
that

1255
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:27,960
that we have you always have

1256
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,960
That's the

1257
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:36,920
so one remark is that so

1258
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,920
so note

1259
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:44,480
that so first of all we had this trivial

1260
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:49,840
statement that if you take a partition

1261
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:54,239
then the lower sum is less or equal to

1262
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:56,800
the upper sum Fine. Then we had that if

1263
01:16:54,239 --> 01:17:00,440
you took a sub partition, if this here

1264
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,440
was a sub partition

1265
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:13,440
of P1. Then this lower sum here

1266
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:16,080
under a sub partition, the lower sum

1267
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:20,360
went up,

1268
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,360
but it's still staying below

1269
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:33,199
So you have this inequality here. Okay.

1270
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:36,000
Now what what is this useful form?

1271
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:38,560
So as a consequence of this we get that

1272
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:42,080
the you know whether or not the function

1273
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:47,360
is rem integral you always have that the

1274
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:51,719
lower integral here of f dx is less or

1275
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,719
equal to the upper integral.

1276
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:57,600
So this here is for all functions. And

1277
01:17:54,480 --> 01:18:02,320
why is this the case? This is because if

1278
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:07,040
you take this here is the soup

1279
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:10,320
of these lower partitions, right?

1280
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:14,640
But if you take any given partition,

1281
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:19,400
then this lower thing here is less than

1282
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,400
than the upper one,

1283
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:27,600
right?

1284
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:32,640
And so now so now imagine that you take

1285
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:35,280
so if you take a lower partition

1286
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:39,840
right suppose sorry suppose now that you

1287
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:42,880
take the soup over all partitions then

1288
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:45,280
it means that there is one partition so

1289
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,960
that this value here is close to the

1290
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:51,600
soup.

1291
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:55,679
But uh but for this one here right you

1292
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,719
have this inequality here right and so

1293
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,880
in fact but in fact if you take any so

1294
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,040
any other partition you can think about

1295
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,960
maybe I'll explain this more detail next

1296
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,800
time because I only have a minute but

1297
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:11,679
but it basically come from this

1298
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:14,960
inequality here is coming from from from

1299
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:16,719
uh from this this inequality here it

1300
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,880
will take just a few minutes to explain

1301
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:22,640
it clearly. So maybe I'll just leave it

1302
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:25,760
here. But but but a key point here is

1303
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:28,239
that you have this inequality here and

1304
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,719
it comes from that

1305
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:33,440
and but but we return to that next time

1306
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:36,480
because it's to make it really clear it

1307
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:39,120
it would take a few minutes.

1308
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:42,560
Now the last thing I want to say in the

1309
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:45,920
is that so this so you may think that we

1310
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,840
sort of whimped out of saying when this

1311
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:51,199
uh right because we just define it we

1312
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:54,880
just say that it's reman integraable if

1313
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:56,640
if uh those two things are equal right

1314
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,199
and so but then the question of course

1315
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:02,320
become when are those two things equal

1316
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:06,280
right so that's the key question so the

1317
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,280
key question is

1318
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,880
when are they equal?

1319
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:24,880
And and we'll answer this next time.

1320
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:27,880
Um where we will show that if f is

1321
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,880
continuous

1322
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,960
then then they are equal.

1323
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,679
Okay.

1324
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:44,400
And so uh so anyways I'll return to

1325
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:46,480
this. I will first um um you know we

1326
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,560
need anyway some more information about

1327
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:52,159
this upper and lower integral and I will

1328
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:54,000
first show why the lower one is less or

1329
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:56,560
equal to the lower one is lesser equal

1330
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,199
to the upper one always and then we will

1331
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,120
talk about you know some criteria for

1332
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:04,000
when they are equal and then we will

1333
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:06,159
prove this for continuous functions

1334
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:11,199
>> is that only

1335
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:15,600
>> no no no it's not it's not it's Not it's

1336
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:19,679
um it's uh yeah it's not a total answer.

1337
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:21,600
It's it's a it's a good initial answer

1338
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:24,960
but there are many functions that are

1339
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:29,199
not continuous that are very worth you

1340
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:31,199
know that plays in key roles and they're

1341
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:33,280
still

1342
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,880
um and we will also look at an example

1343
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,520
it's in the notes but I didn't get to

1344
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:41,600
it. we look at an example of a function

1345
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:44,000
that is u that is not where where you

1346
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:47,400
don't have this equality and this is

1347
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,400
like an old
