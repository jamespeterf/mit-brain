00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,120
Researchers haven't yet found all the

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,519
genes that clearly increase the risk of

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,920
scat. We can increase the discovery of

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,160
genes associated with SCAD by collecting

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,240
health data and samples from larger and

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,080
more diverse patient groups. The

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
scarcity and unpredictable nature of

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,240
SCAD make it challenging to study. But

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,119
with the GVAS research study, we can

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,119
make significant progress.
