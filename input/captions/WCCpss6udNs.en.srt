1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,960
So last time

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,800
uh last time we talked about the basic

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,240
algebraic operation for limit of

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,160
sequences. We talked about the mono

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,240
convergence theorem. So the mono

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,920
convergence theorem was that you had a

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,400
sequence

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,439
that was increasing or it could be

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,280
decreasing. So either it was increasing

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,079
this meant that the next element was

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,000
bigger equal to the previous and then

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,960
they were all assumed to be bounded.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,879
If you had such a sequence or similarly

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,440
if you had a sequence so this was the

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,440
increasing case

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,680
then there was a similar decreasing case

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,359
where the the the

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,600
previous is bigger equal to the next one

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,000
and then they are assumed to be bounded

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,040
from below.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,520
So this was decreasing.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,400
So monotum convergent theorem was that

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,119
if you had a bounded increasing sequence

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,960
or a bounded decreasing sequence in

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,560
either case

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,759
uh uh the sequence is convergent

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,640
and it's converging in the first case in

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,640
this case here a

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,840
um it's converg to the soup

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,840
of the xm to the in case Okay.

31
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,280
And in the case B it converts to the in

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,680
case case B. So that was the mono

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,000
convergence theorem.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,119
And the third thing we talk about and

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,560
that's where we will continue today is

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,079
uh is cruise sequence. So we talked

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,560
about push sequence.

38
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,800
So let me and we prove a few things

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,920
about cruise sequence but we want to

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
examine that all today. So let me remind

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,800
you what a cruise sequence is. So a

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
sequence

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,160
is said to be

44
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:47,239
Uh if for all epsilon greater than zero

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,239
there exist

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,800
there exist n such that

47
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:03,200
if little n is bigger equal to the

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,440
capital n then Um sorry if little n and

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,200
little m.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,840
So if n and m m and n are big or equal

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,720
then they are

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,040
epsilon close together

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:25,440
xn

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:28,319
and x m the distance between them.

55
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,720
So this was a cus sequence and it just

56
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,959
meant quis sequence just meant that the

57
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,959
tail right of the sequence bunchs

58
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,959
together.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,760
Now, uh, let me just prove I think we

60
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,879
maybe talk about this, but let me but

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm going to let me

62
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,480
just a little theorem here.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,360
Um if

64
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,480
if uh xn

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,480
is a cruci sequence

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,439
then uh xn is bounded

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,720
and so the proof of this is a proof.

68
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,800
So now in the definition of it being a

69
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,800
frequency you can take epsilon to be

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,320
equal to one. So if you take take

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,320
epsilon equal to 1

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,440
in the definition

73
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,479
of being

74
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,479
accuracy sequence.

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,600
So this means that there exist there

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
exist

77
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,440
there exist some n

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,440
such that

79
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,400
uh if little n and little m are bigger

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,960
than this n then the difference between

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,800
these two

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,320
is less than one. Right? This is the

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,160
definition where I just apply it to

84
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,880
epsilon equal to one. We have this but

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,880
of course in particular

86
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,320
in particular we can set say m equal to

87
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
this

88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,479
and then you have that x all the other

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,479
ones. This means that for all

90
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,840
then for all

91
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,960
um little n bigger than capital n if

92
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,400
you're looking at this

93
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:07,039
difference here then this is less than

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,960
one I'm only applying this now I'm just

95
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,840
choosing just one single m and I'm

96
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,600
choosing it to be equal to that capital

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:22,319
so you have that And so this means that

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,360
that now you see that if you take now so

99
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,240
so if you take

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,319
uh x so now suppose that little n

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,960
so so for

102
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:41,440
little n bigger than capital n if you if

103
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,400
you look at little n

104
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,720
then you have this

105
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,759
so or

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,199
for or little n big or equal to capital

107
00:06:49,759 --> 00:07:00,400
n. Then you have that the norm of little

108
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:02,639
n. Well, you can write little n as as um

109
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,199
as a difference.

110
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,880
You can write little n

111
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,360
like you can subtract it first and then

112
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,680
add it again. So this is clearly the

113
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,319
same.

114
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
And now you can just

115
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,479
So you have the sum of two things. You

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
can think about this in here as one

117
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,880
number and this is another number. So

118
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:31,880
this is now less than x n minus x

119
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,880
capital n plus the norm of x capital n.

120
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,240
And this here was because little n was

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,599
bigger than capital n. This here is

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,880
bounded by one. So this is less than one

123
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,960
plus the norm.

124
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,440
this.

125
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
So you see that for all the the little

126
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,919
ends that are bigger than capture all of

127
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,479
those there is a uniform arch right and

128
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,160
so this means that if you're now just

129
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:06,879
taking them the maximum

130
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:10,319
of uh the norm of x1 the norm of x2

131
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:15,120
up to the norm of xn

132
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:18,879
uh minus uh sorry xn minus one

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,039
and then x capital n

134
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:28,319
+ one. If you take the maximum of this

135
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:31,800
and call this m then clearly for all n

136
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,800
for all n

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,440
clearly you have for all n

138
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,760
you have that x n is lesser equal to n

139
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,920
right because if n little n is bigger

140
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,600
than capital n then it's bounded by

141
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,399
capital M because it's it's a maximum in

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,640
particular of this and on the other one

143
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,720
that's sort of obvious.

144
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,040
Okay. So so it means that if you have a

145
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,920
cushy sequence it's automatically

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,320
bounded. Okay.

147
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,279
Now we have the

148
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,800
convergence theorem. So next we want to

149
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,800
discuss

150
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
is

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
convergence.

152
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:36,760
So this is the following that uh any

153
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,760
any precision principle

154
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,760
is convergent.

155
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:58,680
Okay. So remember that last time we

156
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,680
proved the following. So so recall

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,560
that last time

158
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,920
we showed the converse

159
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,240
So namely we prove the following

160
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,240
theorem.

161
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,560
to prove that if

162
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,200
that any

163
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,200
convergent sequence

164
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,079
is a cushy sequence

165
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,920
and so the cushy convergence theorem is

166
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,959
to

167
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:55,440
Now uh so we'll come back to the proof

168
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,839
in just a little bit

169
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,839
but before that let me talk about some

170
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,839
applications

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,800
and so the first one we we sort of

172
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,120
started talking a little bit um last

173
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,000
time and this is uh the contracting

174
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,040
mapping the so contracting And that in

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,040
itself have a number of applications. So

176
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,040
contracting

177
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,519
mic

178
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,959
and for that I need some I need to uh

179
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,120
call some definitions.

180
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,760
So,

181
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,760
so a map

182
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:55,720
a map t from r e to r

183
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,720
uh is set to be

184
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,240
a contracting map.

185
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,320
If there exist

186
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,279
some constant C positive C is positive

187
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,360
and the key point is it's it will have

188
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,320
to be positive. So that but the key

189
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,519
point is that this constant has to be

190
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,639
strictly less than one. And then

191
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,920
contracting mapping just means that if

192
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,440
you looking at the difference

193
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,000
between the images

194
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,360
then they are closer together. This

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,160
they're strictly closer together

196
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,639
than than the points that they are

197
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,600
images of.

198
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,519
Okay. So this is a contracting map

199
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,720
right then. So the contracting mapping

200
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,120
again this here inequality is it say

201
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,880
that under the map the images are

202
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,680
squeezed more together.

203
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,880
So now

204
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,800
that's one concept. The other one we

205
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,800
need is that for fixed points.

206
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,600
So the other concept is fixed point.

207
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,880
So So X here is a fixed point.

208
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,240
for MF.

209
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:51,680
See if if it is

210
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:55,600
if under the map the the points uh

211
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,399
remain unchanged. So T of X is equal to

212
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,440
X. So this is what it needs to be. Yeah.

213
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,360
>> But that it's not the same C for X and

214
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,680
Y. It is the same scene. It is.

215
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
>> Yeah, it's the same scene.

216
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,720
>> And we'll come back to this in just a

217
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,920
second, but but it but it it is supposed

218
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,120
to be the same scene.

219
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
You can weaken that a little bit. Uh but

220
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,560
essentially, I mean, you sort of, you

221
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,199
know, at least we'll talk about this in

222
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,199
just a second, but it it's important

223
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,680
just think about it that it's a

224
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,320
requirement that it's the same seat for

225
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,839
all. And the key point is that this C is

226
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,399
strictly less than one. Okay. So this is

227
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,399
a fixed point.

228
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:46,600
And now um so now the first

229
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
little

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
that.

231
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,320
So we have a lema here.

232
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,040
Uh if t

233
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,320
uh is a contracting

234
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,680
then

235
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,680
then um there's at most

236
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,079
at most one

237
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:40,839
there cannot be more than one fix. Okay.

238
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,839
So let's prove that. a pro.

239
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,440
So yeah, so I'm going to So suppose

240
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,800
X and Y are fixed points

241
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,320
and I want to show

242
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,279
that X is equal to Y.

243
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,519
So I'm looking at the

244
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,920
images.

245
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,720
So

246
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,720
uh

247
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,120
Let's continue.

248
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:38,639
So I'm looking at the images under F. So

249
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,480
I'm looking at So I take T of X

250
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,240
and I'm looking at the difference

251
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,560
between T of X and T of Y

252
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,920
and I want to estimate that difference.

253
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,079
Well, on one hand T X is supposed to be

254
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,920
a fixed point. So T of X is the same as

255
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,800
X and likewise for Y. So this here is

256
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,400
the same. So T of X is the same as X. T

257
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,120
Y is supposed to be the same as Y. So I

258
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,000
have this. On the other hand, it's a

259
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,319
contracting map. So this here is less or

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,839
equal to C

261
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:20,160
times the norm of X - Y.

262
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,640
Right? But now C here remember C is

263
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,959
strictly less than one.

264
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,439
So you can only have an inequality like

265
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,400
this, right? If this number here is

266
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,400
zero, right? when c is strictly less

267
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,720
than one. So this here implies that x -

268
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,000
y

269
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,679
the distance is zero and so of course

270
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,360
this means that x is equal to y.

271
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,360
>> Okay. So that's what we want to prove.

272
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Yeah.

273
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,320
>> Yeah. I'm sorry that was uh yeah it

274
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,320
should

275
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,559
because otherwise you know it's it

276
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:07,080
wouldn't be if x is equal to y would be

277
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,080
so should be let's change

278
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,679
okay so a contracting map have at most

279
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,880
one fix one

280
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,720
okay now let's

281
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:25,120
uh so so so let me Just so you're going

282
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:28,799
to do this. So um

283
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,080
um I have harassed the graders to give

284
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,160
you back the homework. I uh it should be

285
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,600
back today. I mean otherwise they're in

286
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,600
trouble. So hopefully but but but and

287
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,919
the assignment for next week is already

288
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,160
posted.

289
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:49,840
And and here's

290
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:55,720
here's um

291
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,720
so this is on the next so I I will

292
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,520
so here's um here's something on pet

293
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,520
stream

294
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,320
and I think it's uh

295
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,520
okay uh yeah I forget which one it is

296
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,960
but anyway on on the third pet

297
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,559
You will be asked to prove the following

298
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,919
that if uh t here

299
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,919
is a contracting map

300
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,240
and

301
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,919
and x here is any point

302
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,919
any point in the domain of this

303
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Then if you form the sequence a n so a1

304
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,760
say that's just x

305
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,360
a2 uh let's let's call it a sorry let's

306
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,080
let's call it a z is x

307
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:07,200
uh a1 here

308
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,200
is t of x t of a is zero so this is t of

309
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,760
and a2

310
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:20,480
is t of a1. So this is the same as t of

311
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:27,160
this. So this is t

312
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,160
* t of x which I'm will write like this

313
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:36,480
and uh a3 so we continue this way a3 is

314
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:40,559
t of a2. So that is

315
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
t applied three times. So t g

316
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,679
t g t g t g t g t g t g t g t g t g t g

317
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,919
t g t g t g t g t g t g t g t g t g t g

318
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,120
of x and I'm going to write this as g c

319
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:55,360
2 of x

320
00:20:49,120 --> 00:21:00,120
and and so on. So a n is going to be t

321
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,120
of a sorry it's t

322
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,919
a n + one

323
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:13,679
is going to be t of a n. So that's the

324
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,840
same as uh t to the power n + one

325
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,520
of x.

326
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Okay.

327
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,720
So if you have a contracting map and you

328
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,039
just start with any point you want and

329
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,440
now you form a sequence that is based on

330
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,080
that point and uh and the nth element is

331
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,200
just where you have applied the map n

332
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:41,840
times to the original point. So if you

333
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,240
form that sequence then you will prove

334
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,440
uh you will show

335
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,799
that uh

336
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,159
in the homework you will show that this

337
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:58,880
sequence so this set

338
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,280
three and I I will just do a

339
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,799
special case of it that you will start

340
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,520
with but we'll just do this now

341
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,080
and then the rest to you to you know I

342
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,720
leave you for the homework but but on

343
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:18,280
piece of three you prove that this a is

344
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,280
a secret

345
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,159
and what is the the key starting point

346
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,679
starting point for this

347
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,120
so now

348
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,120
because you're there you know you're

349
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,200
already uh well started on on p three is

350
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,320
a key starting point for this is to

351
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,720
prove that it's a cruise sequence so I

352
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,799
want to estimate

353
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,480
so this is not enough right I mean I

354
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,039
need to prove what I need to show is

355
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,400
remember I need to prove that when

356
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,720
little m and little m

357
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,120
are sufficiently large then I want to

358
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,120
estimate the distance between these two

359
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,799
and show that they're bunched together,

360
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,840
right? That's what we need to prove.

361
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,720
Prove this precision. I I won't quite do

362
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,840
this, but I do a special case that is a

363
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,400
key starting point. And that is the

364
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,640
where I'm looking at this thing here.

365
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,520
I'm looking at two consecutive element

366
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,320
in the sequence and I'm estimating the

367
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,799
distance. That's not enough to prove

368
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,200
that C sequence, right? Because I need

369
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,080
to prove that for all n and m

370
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,720
sufficiently large. And I'm just proving

371
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,679
here that for any ns sufficiently large

372
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,880
if I'm looking at the neighbor then that

373
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,240
this is very small but but but you can

374
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,320
use the estimates that we will now prove

375
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,600
to prove that it is in fact a sequence.

376
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,400
So in order to estimate this right I'm

377
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:02,640
can think about this thing here

378
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:10,320
as t as a to the n + one this here is

379
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:14,320
just t of a to n and a n itself this is

380
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,760
t of the previous element right this is

381
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,679
how we define them so this means that

382
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,159
this thing here so again I could just

383
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:30,520
write this in here. So this thing is

384
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:30,520
equal to a n minus t of a n minus one

385
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,440
and now I can use that contracting map

386
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,760
right because now I have these two gez

387
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,600
here so I can use that contracting map

388
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,880
so I get less or equal to and then a n

389
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,120
minus a n minus one

390
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:54,559
and so you see that that's the Next the

391
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,279
distance between the next pair is

392
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,960
because C is strictly less than one. It

393
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,600
has decreased with some factor. Right?

394
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:09,400
And so now the the the key starting

395
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,400
point is that if you just iterate this.

396
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,480
So now if I iterate this, so I'm looking

397
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:25,279
at a n + 1 minus a n

398
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:30,720
and I now have that this thing here is

399
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:33,520
less than c a n minus a n minus one. But

400
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,440
now I'm writing forget about the c for a

401
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,559
second. I'm just writing this thing

402
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,679
here. So I do the same thing again. I

403
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:46,880
write this here as the image of a n

404
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:50,080
minus one and I write this n minus one

405
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,919
as the image of the previous one. So n

406
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,880
minus two right and now so I write this

407
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,799
so c here I just have to carry along for

408
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:06,480
the right and then I have t a n minus

409
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:08,960
one minus t a n minus 2.

410
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,760
And now forget about this just use this

411
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,960
contracting mapping. So then this is

412
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,440
less than equal to and then the C here I

413
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,279
to carry along. But then there's another

414
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,279
C that pops out. Right? So this is times

415
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,720
C that pops out because of the

416
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:31,039
contracting mapping and then a N minus

417
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:34,480
one minus A N minus 2. And so you see

418
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:39,840
that you have written this as c^ squ a n

419
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:42,320
minus 2 - one minus a n minus 2. And so

420
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,039
now you continue it and so you see that

421
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,400
the further out you get right. So you

422
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,880
continue this all the way down to that

423
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,760
you're getting that this element is the

424
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,799
initial point and and this one is the

425
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,159
first ele you know a1. This is a z and

426
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,919
this is a1 right

427
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:07,360
and so you see that you're getting

428
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:10,000
something which is like a a c to some

429
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,760
power n times the distance that you

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,080
started with right so this is bounded by

431
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:23,039
uh something like c to the n * a 1 - a z

432
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,039
something like that

433
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,840
and so that's a key starting point. So

434
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,279
if you going very very far out remember

435
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,320
that this number is smaller than one. So

436
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:37,520
this here will become incredibly small

437
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,039
when n is large. Right? And so this is

438
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,080
the key starting point uh to prove that

439
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:48,000
to prove that if you take a contracting

440
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:52,799
map start with any point and you form

441
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,640
this sequence here then it's a sequence.

442
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,480
So now

443
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,840
so and I leave the rest for the

444
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,840
homework. Uh

445
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,799
now let's prove the

446
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:11,000
contracting mapping theorem

447
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,000
using the cush convergence.

448
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,279
cushion

449
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,440
will not prove the contracting Not going

450
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,440
to serve.

451
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,679
Okay. So what is a contracting mapping

452
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:55,960
theorem? The contracting mapping theorem

453
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,960
is that if t here is a contracting map.

454
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,880
So T g from R to R

455
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,919
maps R into R gives a contracting map.

456
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,440
Then

457
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,440
then T has a fixed point.

458
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,679
We already know that such a fixed point

459
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,880
is unique, right? We already proved that

460
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,520
it can at most be one fixed point.

461
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, so let's try to prove that. So

462
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,000
we're going to use like this result from

463
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
PC.

464
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,520
[Applause]

465
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:07,440
So I start with I start with any point

466
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,559
X. You pick any point you want and then

467
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,720
we form the sequence

468
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,720
where you apply this uh uh end time to

469
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
X.

470
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,080
Now we have that. So, so then we have we

471
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:29,080
have so this is this pie set from P

472
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,080
three

473
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,360
that a

474
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,360
is a sequence.

475
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:47,039
[Applause]

476
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:51,399
Okay. But then the but then from the

477
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,399
from Kushik convergence

478
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,320
we have

479
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,159
that

480
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:11,200
uh we have that am

481
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,320
is converging right that this here is

482
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,880
this here is a cushy sequence but the

483
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,600
cus convergence I'm saying that any

484
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,880
cushy sequence is actually convergent so

485
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,320
this here converts to some a

486
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,600
okay and now the idea is that we want to

487
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,600
show so want to show

488
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,320
that

489
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,320
a is a fixed

490
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,159
So that's

491
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,960
this is a kind of uh it's a you know

492
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,080
it's it's it's the contracting mapping

493
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,039
is actually extremely powerful

494
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,039
uh it can be used to again can be used

495
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,880
to solve

496
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:09,120
uh you know uh what's called o ordinary

497
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
differential equations.

498
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,880
And we talk a little bit about that at

499
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,039
some later point in the class. And but

500
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,279
it can also be used to solve uh PDS

501
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,200
which is more complicated partial

502
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:27,760
differential equation and in all kind of

503
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:31,200
other areas of math. Um and um

504
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:35,240
okay so now we want to prove that this a

505
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,240
here is a fixed point.

506
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,640
So

507
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,640
I

508
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,840
have and and we we will come back in

509
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,679
just a minute we'll through something

510
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,880
um related to this but but let me just

511
00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,320
very simple uh so I talking about a n

512
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:05,200
here I know that it's converted to a I

513
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:10,399
then look at the sequence t of a

514
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,159
Well, t of a n that was a n was wrong,

515
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,000
right? It was just one further out of

516
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,799
the sequence, right? But so since a

517
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,320
converge, this means of course that

518
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,679
since

519
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,640
since a n converts to a n, this means

520
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:31,279
that this here will also converge to a

521
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:35,679
n. So since this here a n + one as n

522
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,200
become very large for converge to

523
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,919
okay

524
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,880
now

525
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,279
if you're looking at t

526
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,240
of a n

527
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:51,519
so you want to estimate now

528
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,960
uh so what I want to prove is right so

529
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,840
now I'm looking at this distance so I

530
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:02,919
want to show

531
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,919
So want to show we want to show

532
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,399
that C of A right is equal to A. That's

533
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:16,079
what we want to do.

534
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:20,399
And so if I'm looking at T of A N,

535
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:25,359
right? T of A N, this here was A N +

536
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:30,879
one. And so if I'm looking at t of a n

537
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:34,399
plus uh a n minus uh t of a

538
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:37,280
right because it is a contracting map

539
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:43,560
this thing here is bounded is lesser

540
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,560
equal to c a n minus a

541
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:55,200
and this is also equal to a n + 1 - g of

542
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That was just the definition of the a +

543
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,480
one.

544
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,480
So now I have that a m converts to a. So

545
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:10,480
this means that this here converts to

546
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:14,720
zero. Right? Since so now since

547
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:18,079
a n converts to a then you have that a n

548
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,920
minus a you can think about this as a

549
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,880
sequence that converts to zero.

550
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,760
But this inequality here say that since

551
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:33,000
this goes to zero this in here must also

552
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,000
go to zero. So you see that therefore

553
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:45,040
a n + one minus t of a

554
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,200
goes to zero. Right? So but this but

555
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,160
that this here goes to zero. This just

556
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,720
means that a n + one this much converge

557
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,240
to t of a

558
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,160
right.

559
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,040
But this sequence already converts to a.

560
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,119
There can only be one limit. Right? So

561
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,560
we already had that a m + one converts

562
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,119
to a. But then these two numbers must be

563
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:20,040
the same. Right? So the conclusion here

564
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:20,040
is that that a must be equal to g of a.

565
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,480
Okay.

566
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,800
So from the cus convergence theorem

567
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,200
then you get the contracting mapping

568
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,160
thems

569
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,880
and and we already proved that there was

570
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,359
you get a fixed point and we already

571
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,760
knew that there was at most one fix

572
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,520
point

573
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,640
and so so and so this is a very powerful

574
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,359
idea because for many things

575
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,160
it's almost impossible to find the

576
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,040
actual

577
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,680
fix point. But what you do is that

578
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,800
you're starting with some right. So in

579
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,200
this case you just said you pick any X

580
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,000
and then you just apply the map enough

581
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,880
times. Right? Sometimes you would start

582
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,800
with a you can't

583
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,920
find a fix point but you can find

584
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,680
something pretty close to the fix point

585
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,720
and then then you iterate from there on

586
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,000
and we'll see we'll see just in a

587
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,720
second. which I already talked about

588
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,760
that this applied to the existence

589
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:36,160
of solutions to OD and to PD. And now

590
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,960
let me illustrate this last point.

591
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,280
Another example and this come backs to

592
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:46,000
your question uh about you know is this

593
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,480
the same but but do think about it as

594
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,960
being the same for all X and Y. But you

595
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,520
could have some kind of local statement

596
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,000
where it was true for X and Y in some

597
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,880
small range and that would be enough to

598
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,359
guarantee you a fix point. But but but

599
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,880
in general just I mean it's the same in

600
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,079
the definition it's supposed to be the

601
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,560
same for all x and y but so let me

602
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,000
explain that

603
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,000
in what's called Newton method.

604
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,839
So this is Newton measure

605
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,560
and so the idea is that you have a

606
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,920
function you have some function here f

607
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,880
maybe it doesn't look like a function

608
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:42,880
but it's supposed to this is f ofx

609
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,720
and you want to find where this or you

610
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,440
want to find points where this function

611
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,040
vanishes. Okay.

612
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:59,640
And so so the method is sort of a

613
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,640
numerical method to find such a

614
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,240
you know just you know if if this

615
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,640
function was very simple like a linear

616
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,560
function or quadratic function then of

617
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,240
course it would be easy to find but

618
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,119
maybe this is a very complicated

619
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,200
function and so you wouldn't be you

620
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,160
wouldn't necessarily be able to say

621
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,400
exactly what the point is

622
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,599
and so

623
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:32,560
the idea is that so Newton method

624
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,320
Newton method is that Newton's methods

625
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,240
require that you start with a good guess

626
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,760
and but this is the idea of the Newton

627
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,480
method.

628
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,480
So here's the idea

629
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,720
that we're looking at a function like

630
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,760
this. I'm going to assume that this is

631
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,440
um that is not zero. So it's actually

632
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,440
monotom is either increasing or

633
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,440
decreasing.

634
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,760
So I I'm assuming that there's nowhere

635
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,480
where the the fractional vanishes.

636
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,640
And then I defined a map t of x to be

637
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,160
equal to x

638
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:20,480
minus uh f ofx

639
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:25,119
frime of x. This seems kind of uh quite

640
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:30,040
it seems uh yeah seems far away from

641
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,040
now. But if you define it like this.

642
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:38,800
Now let me take the derivative of this.

643
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,640
If I take the derivative of this now

644
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,599
then I get that this in here the

645
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,400
derivative of x that's just one. The

646
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:50,160
derivative of this in here

647
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,920
um it's the this is a closing. So it's f

648
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,839
prime

649
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,480
uh times

650
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:03,119
my derivative of this time frime and

651
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:07,920
then f prime squ minus

652
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:12,760
and then uh f fp prime like that right

653
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,760
that's a quotion for taking

654
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,560
and so you see that you can write this

655
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,359
if you split this up into two this has

656
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,880
one you split it up to two this has

657
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,760
frime

658
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:32,960
2 / frime squ and then this here becomes

659
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,640
plus and then I'm writing it as f f

660
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,640
prime

661
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,640
fr

662
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,240
and so you see that this here cancel

663
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,560
with that so these are cancel so you

664
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,839
have that the derivative of this map

665
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:59,359
is just f of x

666
00:41:51,839 --> 00:42:02,400
uh frime prime of x frime of x²

667
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:06,280
that's the derivative

668
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,280
and now of course

669
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,680
if I'm using the mean magnet

670
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,040
Then I have that uh derivative.

671
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:36,079
Then I have that t of x minus t of y. By

672
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,000
the mean man theorem say that this thing

673
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,000
here is the derivative

674
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,720
it's actually like wer theorem or

675
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,920
whatever but but you can also think

676
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:52,160
about this is the derivative at

677
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:56,440
somewhere in between x and y times the

678
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,440
difference between x and y

679
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:11,160
so We see that if we already knew. So if

680
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,160
we can show if we knew

681
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,720
that the derivative

682
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,640
was bounded everywhere was bounded by

683
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,760
some C little C that was less than one.

684
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,680
If you had that then of course then you

685
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,000
just take absolute value of this. So

686
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:36,880
then you had the t of x minus t of y the

687
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,760
absolute value was was equal to t prime

688
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,520
in this intermediate point x - y but in

689
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,680
this intermediate point we're assuming

690
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,560
that everywhere the derivative is lesser

691
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,480
equal to c. So this here is now this is

692
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,560
lesser equal to c. So c x - y and we're

693
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,359
assuming that c is strictly less than

694
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,400
one. So you see that this here if we

695
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:03,040
knew that the derivative of t was

696
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,880
strictly less than one everywhere then

697
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,400
we would know that this map was

698
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,280
contracting that.

699
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,760
Okay. But but of course you know what we

700
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,000
have for the derivative is we have this

701
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,000
in here.

702
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:26,760
And so now but now the idea is that if

703
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,760
you start with a really good guess

704
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,440
so if you start with a so so the idea is

705
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,640
so so idea

706
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:45,160
the idea of with Newton method

707
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,160
is start with a good this

708
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,160
like this and I'm not going to make that

709
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,839
too precise.

710
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,079
I'm putting it in quotation marks but

711
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,560
the idea is that you want to so good

712
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,119
guesses remember that what we want is we

713
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,359
want to find a point we're interested in

714
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,680
this point here where this function here

715
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,880
we're interested in a point where the

716
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,200
function vanishes right so starting with

717
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,920
a good guess means that you're starting

718
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,319
you may not start where the function

719
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,800
vanishes but you're starting somewhere

720
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,640
where where the values is really small,

721
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,160
right? That would be a good guess,

722
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:34,440
right?

723
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:34,440
And so start with a good guess meaning

724
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:42,240
that f at that point

725
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,000
is is is small

726
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,520
is is very small.

727
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,880
Now, of course, you're going to ask what

728
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:55,680
do you mean by very small? So very small

729
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:59,200
here is going to mean that the value.

730
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,400
So so now we have right from this here.

731
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:07,280
So we have that we have that the

732
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:10,240
derivative here of this map here

733
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:16,000
was equal to these two terms cancel out.

734
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:18,319
So this is f of x f prime of x

735
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,560
uh frime

736
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,359
of x².

737
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,240
So starting with a good guess means that

738
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:28,319
this thing here is really really small

739
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,640
and in fact I want it to be small

740
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,960
compared with this. Right? So if this

741
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,040
here is really small compared with that

742
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,200
then I can guarantee that the absolute

743
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,880
value of this is smaller than one.

744
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,040
Right?

745
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,079
And so you see that if you start with a

746
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,880
really good guess then it would be a

747
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,440
contracting mapping right and then of

748
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,000
course you need to prove that so you're

749
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,920
forming the sequence right and you need

750
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,920
to prove somehow you need to estimate

751
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,040
that you need to be able to say that

752
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,920
that once you form the sequence you you

753
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,960
know the next thing that is spitting out

754
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,680
is also a good guess right so that you

755
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,960
stay in this range of good guess, right?

756
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,359
And if it has this property, then it

757
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,240
would be a contracting map and you would

758
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,079
guarantee to get a fixed point, right?

759
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,560
But and but that's all the Newton

760
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:26,800
methods say, right? So you need to kind

761
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,440
of justify why if you start with a good

762
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,000
guess, why you keep as you're iterating

763
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,800
this process, why you keep in the range

764
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,119
of good guesses.

765
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,079
But but but you know the news method

766
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:43,200
doesn't doesn't tell you anything about

767
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,079
that but but but it require that to be a

768
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,960
part

769
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:52,880
and so okay so it's a contracting map

770
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,520
this T is a contracting map right if if

771
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,160
I can start with a good guess and when I

772
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:02,400
do this when I form so I start with this

773
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,280
good guess and then I'm looking at that

774
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,079
the next thing is this t of x and then I

775
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,079
t^ squ of x

776
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,880
right then and I want all of these to

777
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:16,720
also be good guesses and then I'm saying

778
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,400
that as n goes to infinity this here is

779
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,800
cons

780
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,520
is going to converge to this fixed point

781
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,400
I guess I called it x well this is the

782
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,599
fix point

783
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,640
fix point

784
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,960
for for t

785
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,119
Now,

786
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,040
so now we we we started with a function

787
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,440
and what we were interested in, we

788
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:48,480
wanted to find a root. So, x0 where this

789
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,760
function vanishes, right? And I

790
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,079
constructed a contracting map. But now I

791
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,319
need to relate this contracting map or

792
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,040
the fixed point for the contracting to

793
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,480
the original problem. So, what is a

794
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,119
fixed point for the contracting map?

795
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,760
So the map here

796
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:13,680
the map we defined

797
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:17,839
was g of x is equal to x - fx

798
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:21,680
over frime of x

799
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:24,240
but a fixed point fixed point. So if x0

800
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,359
is a fixed point

801
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:31,839
then this means that uh this here is the

802
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:34,640
same as x0 minus f of x0

803
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:37,119
frime of x0

804
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:42,640
and now you can just write. So therefore

805
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:46,880
this implies that f of x0 minus f of x0

806
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,359
over frime of x0 this here you subtract

807
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,240
x0 on both sides and this is equal to

808
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:56,440
zero but that of course means that

809
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,440
denominator must be zero.

810
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:03,040
So a fixed point is indeed a point where

811
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,760
f of x0

812
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,760
is equal to zero.

813
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,680
Okay.

814
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,240
Now,

815
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:18,000
um, so now we want to prove the C

816
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,680
convergence,

817
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,319
but we're going to cheat just a little

818
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,720
bit because we are going to deduce it

819
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:27,119
from another theorem that I will prove

820
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,119
next time.

821
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,119
So,

822
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,160
so to prove the component

823
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,559
and that's we'll prove next time.

824
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,280
So, what is a bosano?

825
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:15,319
So the person theorem. So the person

826
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,319
theorem says that every bounded sequence

827
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,559
has a convergent

828
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,839
substitution.

829
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,240
So that's a coal is

830
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,760
okay.

831
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,720
Now let's try to so I assume this again

832
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,000
I'll prove this next time. So let's but

833
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,760
let's

834
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,760
This is to prove the cush

835
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,359
from the

836
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,559
from the device. I show

837
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,640
kids.

838
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,160
>> That's fall off.

839
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,160
So remember the cushy convergence here

840
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:45,480
I'm saying that if you have a C sequence

841
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,480
then it is converted. So suppose

842
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,920
XN is a C.

843
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,119
Okay, I want to prove that it's

844
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,839
convergent.

845
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,640
But I already we already showed we

846
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:07,520
already show

847
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:12,520
we already proven

848
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,520
show that any C sequence

849
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:23,640
uh any C sequence

850
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:23,640
shown that XN any C sequence is bounded

851
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,800
right this is this earlier.

852
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,960
So now by therefore by the biosium

853
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,160
by the pano biosium

854
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,920
there's a subsequence

855
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,280
a converted subsequence

856
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,000
So there's a converted subsequent x and

857
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
k.

858
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,599
So So now

859
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,160
So you have

860
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:37,200
you have that uh you have that this

861
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:39,760
subsequence here convert to some x

862
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:44,400
and now I want to show that the original

863
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:49,440
sequence converts to x.

864
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:54,280
So uh so give so since

865
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,280
xn is accus

866
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,920
given

867
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,160
given uh epsilon greater than zero.

868
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,160
There exist

869
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,720
there exist uh capital n. So that so

870
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:21,520
that if

871
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:25,920
m and n are bigger than capital n then

872
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:29,520
uh x n minus xm

873
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,440
is less than epsilon

874
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:36,599
using the epsilon

875
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,599
in the definition of being

876
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:42,960
but now I and this let's call this the

877
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,960
exist n let's call it n1

878
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,799
So now since

879
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,319
x and k

880
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,839
converge

881
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,839
to x there exist

882
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:11,280
for that epsilon there exist

883
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:15,359
uh n2 uh k2 n2. Yeah. So that if uh if k

884
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:21,520
here is bigger than n_sub_2

885
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:24,960
then uh x n k - x

886
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,960
is less than ep 2.

887
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,960
Okay.

888
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:48,720
So now,

889
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:54,400
so now you just take, so now we take um

890
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:57,599
we take um n to be equal to

891
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:00,720
um the maximum

892
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:06,400
of uh n1

893
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:10,400
and n sorry and n

894
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,960
two. This is the one that corresponds to

895
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:17,160
right. So this is where where k is

896
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,160
taking equal to this n2.

897
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:26,720
So if we take n like that and you're

898
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:30,079
looking at uh n bigger equal to n and

899
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:32,160
you now want to estimate this thing here

900
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:38,640
then you can think about this difference

901
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:40,240
here as x - x n2

902
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,440
plus

903
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:49,119
uh sorry x n

904
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:52,160
like this minus plus uh x

905
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:58,480
x n

906
00:57:52,160 --> 00:58:05,400
uh x uh x n - uh x

907
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:05,400
uh n / x terms like like that

908
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:15,440
and this here is now in this. So this is

909
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:18,720
now in this uh subsequence and so one of

910
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,520
them this is less than epsilon / two and

911
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,520
this here is less than epsilon / two and

912
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:28,119
so you get that this difference here was

913
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,119
less than epilon. Okay

914
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:37,240
now so this is why the balsano vastra

915
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,240
theorem implies a cush convergence.

916
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,280
Okay. So now the next thing is that I

917
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:47,440
want to give another

918
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,079
uh application of so of the kus

919
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:54,680
convergence. So here's another

920
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,680
application of the cus convergence.

921
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,079
Right.

922
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,640
So one one application was to the

923
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:17,040
contracting mapping theorem. But here's

924
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:20,040
another application of the of the cushy

925
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,040
convergence

926
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:31,799
theorem.

927
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,799
So this is the extreme value theorem.

928
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,640
them.

929
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:47,599
Now before I I um before I explain that,

930
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:51,440
let me

931
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:54,240
introduce uh this notion of a function

932
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,520
being continuous

933
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:01,839
in a rigorous way. So what does it mean

934
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,839
for a function to be continuous?

935
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,119
So a function

936
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,319
f say from r to r it could be a subset

937
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:19,240
of r

938
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,240
all of them is set to be continuous

939
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,799
to being continuous

940
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:34,000
at x0 at some points x0.

941
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,960
If

942
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:42,359
for all

943
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,359
epsilon greater than zero there exist

944
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:49,200
there exist delta greater than zero such

945
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:53,280
that

946
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:57,040
if x minus x0

947
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:59,040
is smaller than delta then the images

948
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,680
are

949
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,839
within epsilon.

950
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,839
each other.

951
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:14,079
So if you think about it, so if you have

952
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,160
like the function, this is a function

953
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,760
you you

954
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:23,760
to say that it's continuous at some x0

955
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:27,359
means that if this thing here is this

956
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,440
here is now f of x0.

957
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:32,559
If you take a little interval around

958
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:36,079
here, this is a epsilon interval around

959
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:38,160
here. Then there should be some delta

960
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,640
interval around here. So that if you're

961
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,720
looking at images here, then it will map

962
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,079
into here.

963
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,079
Right? That's what it means to be

964
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,079
continuous.

965
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,280
Okay? So this is continuous at a point

966
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:58,040
and a function is set to be continuous

967
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,040
if it's continuous at all points.

968
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,920
So,

969
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,440
so a function

970
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:17,000
is set to be continuous.

971
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:29,480
If it is continuous

972
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,200
at all.

973
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:49,599
And so now we have a little theorem here

974
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,920
and this is often useful way of thinking

975
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,920
about continuity.

976
01:02:53,200 --> 01:03:00,599
So if

977
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:00,599
f is continuous.

978
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,160
So let's say f let's just say it doesn't

979
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,319
need to be all of r. You just have to be

980
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,480
careful that everything that you talk

981
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:13,920
about is in the domain. But let's just

982
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,920
say that f is a function from r to r is

983
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,920
continuous.

984
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:26,799
So if f is is continuous

985
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:32,000
uh and

986
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:34,559
xn is a sequence that converts to x

987
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,880
then

988
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:42,079
then the images so f of xn this is

989
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:45,079
another sequence those converge to f of

990
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,079
x

991
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:52,480
this is this This is a usual way of

992
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,000
thinking about it being continuous.

993
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:59,640
Um,

994
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,640
and so now so now why is this the case?

995
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,520
So,

996
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,880
so

997
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:16,200
since

998
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,200
f is continuous,

999
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,640
the only leaf that is continuous at is

1000
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,760
x.

1001
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:31,240
So since it continue at x, this means

1002
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,240
that for all epsilon you're given

1003
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,319
Given epsilon greater than zero there

1004
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,319
exist

1005
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,839
there exist delta greater than zero such

1006
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:46,319
that

1007
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:50,319
if

1008
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:52,960
uh x - y

1009
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,599
this is this this x here that you think

1010
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:59,119
about fixed if x if you have another

1011
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:06,119
point that is within delta

1012
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:06,119
And uh the images f of x - f of y

1013
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,920
this is just that is continuous at that

1014
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:17,839
one point x. Okay.

1015
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:24,640
Now since

1016
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:28,160
since um xn converts to x right since xn

1017
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:32,079
converts to x this means that if you use

1018
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:36,559
this delta here in the definition of uh

1019
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:39,799
convergence then uh there exist

1020
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,799
there exist

1021
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:48,640
capital n such that If x if sorry if

1022
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:52,079
little n is bigger than capital n then x

1023
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:54,799
n minus x

1024
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,119
is less than delta.

1025
01:05:54,799 --> 01:06:01,280
But now you see that if little n is

1026
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:04,960
bigger than capital n then these lies

1027
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:10,280
this close to x. But then this say that

1028
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,280
the images. So therefore the images

1029
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:17,319
f of xn

1030
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,319
minus f of x

1031
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,839
is less than epsilon. And this was just

1032
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,319
as long as little n was bigger than

1033
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:27,039
capital n. That's exactly proving that

1034
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:31,319
this sequence converts to that. Right?

1035
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,319
So that's okay.

1036
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:41,559
Now let's prove the extreme value. I

1037
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,559
need to state that first.

1038
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,200
And there's two versions

1039
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:57,160
uh of it.

1040
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,160
So extreme guys.

1041
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:12,079
So you take a function f on some

1042
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,880
interval a and b a real number.

1043
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:19,000
They're both included.

1044
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,000
And f here is continuous.

1045
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:26,640
It's continuous at all points.

1046
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:29,839
It needs to be continuous at all points

1047
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,599
and this interval needs to contain the

1048
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:36,319
ins.

1049
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:42,599
So if this is continuous then

1050
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,599
the soup of f is achieved

1051
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:51,799
at some

1052
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,799
uh x.

1053
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:00,680
So meaning that soup

1054
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,680
of f over this interval

1055
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:10,559
is equal to the value

1056
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:14,000
um let's say let's call it x capital m

1057
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:16,560
yeah capital m for max

1058
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:20,080
at some point in particular the soup is

1059
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:24,080
finite right the soup is finite and it's

1060
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:28,239
not really a soup it's a max Right? And

1061
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:31,040
so likewise it also said that moreover

1062
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:33,199
just the same thing and you could in the

1063
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,679
usual way you could obtain it from this

1064
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:37,199
by looking at the function minus f if

1065
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,359
you wanted or you could just prove it

1066
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:44,400
directly with the same that we're going

1067
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:48,480
to give here. Moreover, uh the in

1068
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:52,480
of f over this interval

1069
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:54,799
is equal to the value at some point. So

1070
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:58,159
it's not, you know, it's not just a in

1071
01:08:54,799 --> 01:09:02,440
it actually is a minimum where x little

1072
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:02,440
m is.

1073
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:13,440
And so now let's try to prove that. And

1074
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:16,159
so this is going to use this theorem

1075
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:22,040
that we proved this theorem and then

1076
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:22,040
it's going to use uh the kushi conver

1077
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:51,120
So um okay so and I'm just going to

1078
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:53,520
prove like just because the two the two

1079
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,920
there's two parts to the extreme values

1080
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,400
the this with a soup and that's this

1081
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,880
with in but the proof uh you know with

1082
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,960
obvious modification

1083
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,440
they're same

1084
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,679
okay so I'm just going to focus on the

1085
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,840
soup.

1086
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:14,960
So, so I so I want to prove so looking

1087
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,760
at the soup of this function I pro the

1088
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,159
soup could be infinity. Okay. So,

1089
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,520
usually we like soup to be finite but

1090
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:28,120
let me allow this that if if there is no

1091
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,120
upper bound then I will write infinity.

1092
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:37,640
So in any case I um there exist

1093
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,640
there exist

1094
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,080
xn

1095
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:46,840
so that xn

1096
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,840
so that f there exist a sequence

1097
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:56,840
in this domain here so that the f of xn

1098
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,840
converge to this

1099
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,040
of

1100
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,000
Okay.

1101
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:04,640
>> Okay. I'm allowing here and we don't

1102
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,600
usually like this but I allow this here

1103
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,080
to be infinite. If it's infinite then I

1104
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,719
just mean that there's a sequence where

1105
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,800
the value of these become larger and

1106
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:17,800
larger than

1107
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,800
right.

1108
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:26,080
So I have that but now you see this here

1109
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:29,280
is in this range. So this is a bounded

1110
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:31,280
this is a boundary. So note that xn So

1111
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:36,520
note

1112
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:36,520
that xn is a boundary sequence.

1113
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:45,480
So then I'm using not kushi conversion

1114
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:54,320
but I use the banana vas. So it's a

1115
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:57,320
bounded sequence. which I know that they

1116
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,320
exist

1117
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:02,520
a convergent

1118
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,280
subsequent

1119
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:16,000
it's a good exercise to see that this

1120
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,440
sequence in itself you know you can just

1121
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,719
draw a little picture and you'll

1122
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:23,520
convince yourself that it this sequence

1123
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:26,800
it in itself may not be convergent. But

1124
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,760
after you pass to a subsequence, you you

1125
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:34,480
can find a converging subsequence.

1126
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:37,120
So it converge. So this here converge

1127
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,920
and it converts to something in this

1128
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:44,400
interval, right? And that's important.

1129
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:48,000
So it converts to some to some x and I

1130
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:51,199
call this x capital m.

1131
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,120
Okay. So converging and the key point

1132
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:59,360
here is that this thing here is lying in

1133
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:00,960
this interval and and the function is

1134
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:04,000
defined

1135
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:08,080
in particular at this point. Right? So

1136
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:11,360
if this had not included the end point

1137
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:13,760
it converts to one of the end point but

1138
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:16,320
the function would not be defined there.

1139
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,199
So you wouldn't be able to conclude the

1140
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:22,000
extreme direct but anyway. So should we

1141
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:24,640
include the end point here?

1142
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,840
Then now we have

1143
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:31,040
now we have that from this theorem that

1144
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:33,520
is right here we have that since this

1145
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,840
sequence converts to that we have that

1146
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,840
the images

1147
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:44,960
converge

1148
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:49,040
to sorry to the image of

1149
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:52,560
X capital N right

1150
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:55,520
but on the other hand this sequence here

1151
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,080
was a subsequence of a sequence that

1152
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,560
converts to the soup. Right? But if you

1153
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,280
take a sequence that converts to

1154
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,440
whatever number, then any subsequence

1155
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,760
will convert to the same number. So this

1156
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,280
here also

1157
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,520
converts to to

1158
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,920
the soup

1159
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,280
to soup.

1160
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:21,679
And so this means that these two numbers

1161
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,800
here must be the same.

1162
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:26,480
And so you should just you know it would

1163
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:30,159
take you just a second to convince

1164
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,880
yourself that everything is fine if you

1165
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:35,760
know if a I didn't know that the soup

1166
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:39,440
was a finite number but infinite right

1167
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:42,320
that it's that is still fine but but

1168
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:45,120
it's that should also take a minute to

1169
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:47,840
convince yourself about that. So that

1170
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,560
that proves the extreme value theorem

1171
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,640
right that the if you take a function

1172
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,360
that is continuous

1173
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:58,880
and defined on an interval where the

1174
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:01,520
interval include both end points then uh

1175
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:05,120
the s the soup is achieved. So the soup

1176
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:07,840
is really a max and the in by very

1177
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:12,679
similar proof the inom is also achieved

1178
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,679
and so both the min and max

1179
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,159
Sorry.

1180
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:27,440
>> Okay. So that was the So yeah, that's

1181
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,040
right. So you're saying just so it was

1182
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,719
clear enough that it was a boundary

1183
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,280
sequence because it lying in this

1184
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:36,000
bounded interval, right? So it's a

1185
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:39,360
boundary sequence. Are you asking why

1186
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:45,480
such a bound sequence exist?

1187
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:45,480
>> So okay. So, so I just so

1188
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,520
you have you have this function,

1189
01:15:51,440 --> 01:16:00,480
right? So, so like this. So, you you

1190
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:03,600
take the soup of f over this in term

1191
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:06,960
and so this means that that if you take

1192
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,920
any any epsilon and you subtract it from

1193
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:14,000
the two, right? Then actually there must

1194
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:17,199
exist a x depending on this epsilon

1195
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,880
there must exist so that the value at

1196
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:22,880
this x is larger than this right and so

1197
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,760
you could imagine instead of epsilon

1198
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,400
here take looking at a sequence like

1199
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,320
this and then this gives you a sequence

1200
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,760
like that

1201
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:36,080
and so right so that would be how and

1202
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,640
the same when you do

1203
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:40,719
and so once you have it it's bound

1204
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:43,840
sequence because it's lie between A and

1205
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:46,239
B, right? You're using the Banana Vest

1206
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,640
theorem that we prove next time to get a

1207
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:51,920
convergent subsequence and then you

1208
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:54,880
apply the theorem this theorem here to

1209
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,880
get that in that case the maximum and

1210
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,600
likewise for the minimum that they

1211
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:03,080
achieved.

1212
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,080
Any questions?
