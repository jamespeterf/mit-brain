1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,440
right. Well, welcome to the first math

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,680
lecture. Uh the topic today is linear

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,880
algebra. And what I expect is that for

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,680
most of you the topics will be very

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,679
familiar. At least we'll be covering

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,840
basic fundamentals of vector algebra.

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,280
Then dealing with uh special matrices,

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,000
matrices that are used in applications,

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
igen vectors and igen value uh

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,640
decompositions,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,000
singular value decompositions, and then

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,800
uh finally uh the peron froinius

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,680
theorem. And what's really neat about

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,960
quantitative finance is that linear

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,120
algebra can really be very useful in

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,320
understanding different computations we

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,520
want to do. So uh it makes our life

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,360
easier. Well, let's just begin with a

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,600
discussion of basic linear algebra

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,960
concepts. Um I'll use a notation where

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,360
often I'll have a bold vector notation

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,759
for or bold letter for note noting a

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,799
vector. Uh so this bold v is a vector in

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,680
m dimensional space and it just consists

26
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,799
of an ordered list of numbers and it we

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,680
can think of it as a column vector

28
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,159
typically sometimes we'll think of it as

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,880
a row vector but uh special cases of

30
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,880
vectors will be the vector of all zeros

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,479
and the vector of all ones. Uh and we

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,159
can think of a graphical representation

33
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,360
of

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,479
a vector um

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,560
where we can think of it as perhaps just

36
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,760
a single point in in this case

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,080
two-dimensional space

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,760
or with an origin. Here we might think

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,239
of the vector representing the directed

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:30,080
line segment from the origin to that

41
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,599
point where this is v1 and this is v2.

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,440
Um depending on our application uh both

43
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,280
of these can be useful. Um

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,440
and

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,720
a basic example for us would be could be

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,720
the closing prices on a given day for

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:55,040
all stocks in the S&P 500 index. So we

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,800
can think of P boldface being a vector

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,000
of 500 values corresponding to the

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,560
closing price of stocks that are in the

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,440
S&P 500 index.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,080
Importantly uh the prices are positive.

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,800
So that's where the R plus comes into

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:22,879
play. And if we consider a portfolio

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:27,920
holding shares of the S&P 500 stocks,

56
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:32,319
we can represent that with a vector Q.

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:36,560
And the value of such a portfolio at the

58
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,519
end of the day is simply the sum of the

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,680
quantities, the shares times the price

60
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,159
per share.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:51,280
Now um with this

62
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,200
uh and later on we'll see that um sort

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,080
of Q

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,840
dop the dot product of those two vectors

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,439
gives us the value of the portfolio.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,040
Um

67
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:13,040
what we're going to find useful um is to

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:18,639
actually add to our 500 stocks the value

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:23,199
of a cash holding in the u in the

70
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,560
portfolio. So we can think of p 0 of t

71
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,960
just being a fixed $1

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,280
and then q knot tells us how many

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,680
dollars we hold. And so um our portfolio

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,040
value

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:44,960
uh will

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:48,880
be given by this number. Um and we can

77
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,160
think about rebalancing portfolios,

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,759
computing portfolio and loss on a daily

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,360
basis.

80
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,639
And

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,280
we can characterize rebalancing the

82
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:08,160
portfolio as shifting from shares held

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:11,160
at the end of day T

84
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,160
um

85
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:20,320
QJ of T+1 to be held through day T + one

86
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:26,639
by adjusting the quantity for each stock

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:30,800
by a delta J. And if we constrain the

88
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,080
sum of the change in shares

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,840
across the J stocks

90
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,520
and cash and the PJ multiplying by the

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,720
PJ of T, we can constrain this sum to be

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,520
equal to zero. So this would correspond

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,960
to a rebalancing of the portfolio.

94
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,960
um and uh

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,240
basically not taking any sort of

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,680
distributions from from the account. Now

97
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,240
uh with the net gain

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:10,000
um let's see this terminology PNL

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:14,000
uh it's in a sense a misnomer I think

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,039
because it's really pro profit and loss

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,840
uh but it's referred to as P&L portfolio

102
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:25,440
net gain. We can just look at the change

103
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:30,000
in value from day t to day t + one. And

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,240
this will have this simple form for uh

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,800
the change in portfolio value. Basically

106
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,319
the shares that are held from the end of

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,319
day t to t + one times the change in

108
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:46,639
price from day t to day t+1.

109
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,840
And uh so this is uh the portfolio uh

110
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,479
net gain. And

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,240
here we're talking about portfolio

112
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,960
management maybe on a daily basis where

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,960
at the end of the day we make a decision

114
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,919
as to how to rebalance our portfolio and

115
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:12,400
there's a net gain during that period.

116
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,919
um one could adjust the period of

117
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,199
rebalancing to be intraday on a regular

118
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,840
or irregular basis and you know we'd

119
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,080
have to have extra notation to do that.

120
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:30,080
Um now

121
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:36,000
with with uh vector uh concepts

122
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,800
um if we multiply a vector V by a scalar

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,240
C then we just multiply through each of

124
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,639
the components of V by that scaler. And

125
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,840
if we add two vectors,

126
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,800
we simply comprise the sum of components

127
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,639
uh element by element. And the

128
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,240
dotproduct between two vectors is simply

129
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:05,520
the sum of the product of the two. So

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,840
this allows us to work with

131
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
vector algebra associated with

132
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,240
portfolios.

133
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,479
If we have two portfolios

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,960
uh we can consider

135
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:28,319
um let's see we can think of a uh

136
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:31,759
a QT and a in this notation a WT

137
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,279
as two different portfolios.

138
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:39,760
And with each of these portfolios,

139
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:43,599
we can determine what the profit and

140
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,360
loss is of each portfolio.

141
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,040
So for Q, it's the value at the end of

142
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,760
day minus the value at the beginning of

143
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,560
the day. And similarly for portfolio W.

144
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,720
And it's

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:05,440
useful to include in the notation here

146
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,360
this sort of BOD and EOD to represent

147
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,120
beginning of day, end of day. And what's

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,360
um

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:19,040
relevant actually is that um the uh QT

150
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,040
uh

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:28,399
portfolio composition is while it's

152
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,800
indexed uh by T um it's actually uh

153
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
determined at the end of day t minus

154
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,519
one.

155
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,160
And so uh

156
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,080
one needs to be careful in doing

157
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:46,000
computations with portfolio value

158
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,480
measurement that you're always using

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
portfolios that are defined using only

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,600
information up to a given time point. So

161
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,959
if we're going to be rebalancing at the

162
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,880
end of the day uh for investment the

163
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,839
next day um we can't know what will

164
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,920
happen on the next day.

165
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:12,080
All right. Well with these portfolios

166
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,040
that are just um simple vectors we can

167
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,200
look at their difference. And so if we

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,200
look at

169
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,399
dt equal to qt minus wt.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,079
Okay, this defines another portfolio.

171
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:34,560
We often constrain portfolios to be long

172
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:39,600
only meaning the Q's and W's are

173
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:43,519
positive or zero. Um but there's no

174
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,880
reason why we can't allow component uh

175
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,760
weights in uh portfolios to be negative

176
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,880
and in this case it's negative shares

177
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,480
and so one can have a long short

178
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,480
portfolio

179
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,320
that

180
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:06,079
is given by D and we can calculate the

181
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,720
profit and loss of that D portfolio by

182
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:14,720
subtracting ing the profit and loss of

183
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:17,680
the Q and W. Um, now let's see with

184
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,360
uh short selling in markets. Um, let's

185
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,120
see who in the class might offer a

186
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,000
description of what it means to sell

187
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,240
short a stock. So suppose that we have

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,320
DT

189
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:39,519
sub 2 is equal to say minus 200

190
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,480
What would that

191
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,160
mean? Or, you know, can we actually

192
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,160
realize a portfolio where we're short

193
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,760
one of the

194
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,760
stocks by 200 shares?

195
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm sure someone Okay. What's your name?

196
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,120
>> Okay. Thank you, Alex.

197
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:06,639
>> I believe it is someone else's stock.

198
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,279
>> Yes. You basically sell first, buy back

199
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:14,639
later, and you sell by you don't have

200
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:16,639
the stock, so you uh borrow it from some

201
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,399
seller. And

202
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,639
uh brokerage accounts that have margin

203
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:29,440
allow you to engage in this kind of uh

204
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,240
transaction. And so the policy

205
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,680
of the brokerage is is that if you want

206
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,279
to sell short a stock, they need to

207
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,920
locate some shares for you to borrow.

208
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:46,560
And what's rather neat about that

209
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,160
selling short is that your brokerage

210
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:54,720
account gets credited with the sale of

211
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:58,480
those shares. So your brokerage account

212
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,639
will um have a positive cash flow due to

213
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,920
the short selling.

214
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,639
And with such a positive

215
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,360
uh contribution to the uh brokerage

216
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:14,560
account, you can actually invest long in

217
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,040
more than say 100% of your wealth that's

218
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,440
in the or of your bank account or

219
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:26,160
brokerage account. So um so that's quite

220
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:29,040
advantageous and allows for very uh

221
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,160
interesting trading opportunities.

222
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,519
All right. Well, an important special

223
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,200
case of a long short portfolio

224
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:43,760
is a zerocost portfolio.

225
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,079
And this would be one where the sum of

226
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,079
basically the values of the long and

227
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,600
short positions balance each other

228
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,839
perfectly.

229
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:58,480
And so we have a portfolio DT in this

230
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:02,800
case which where the D components are

231
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:06,480
not all zero but the value the net value

232
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:10,560
of the portfolio is in fact zero.

233
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:15,040
And we can

234
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,959
hope for the possibility of an arbitrage

235
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,480
portfolio,

236
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:25,839
which could be a portfolio that has zero

237
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,320
cost but has a positive

238
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,800
profit and loss

239
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,360
over a period.

240
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:39,360
And this kind of opportunity

241
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,720
generally uh well it it's doesn't exist

242
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,040
sort of inefficient markets but markets

243
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:51,279
are never completely efficient and so it

244
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,560
can be feasible to

245
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,199
identify portfolios that may be close to

246
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,279
an arbitrage portfolio.

247
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,160
Um

248
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:08,639
what in fact happens is that this profit

249
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,120
and loss of a zerocost portfolio will be

250
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,680
random

251
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,959
and depending upon the market model that

252
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,320
applies to the u market we're trading

253
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:26,320
in. Um it may be that there are

254
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,920
opportunities that uh yield a positive

255
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,440
profit uh all the time in which case we

256
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,399
would say that's an arbitrage

257
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:39,600
opportunity. What we'll see later today

258
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,440
is the question of under what conditions

259
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,279
is there

260
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,880
no arbitrage in a given market

261
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:52,560
and uh how do we characterize

262
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,240
prices of assets in a market with no

263
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,759
arbitrage.

264
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,959
And ultimately it turns out that uh

265
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,360
option pricing theory

266
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,480
that that was intro or mentioned last

267
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,880
time of black shores and merin is all

268
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,959
based upon arbitragefree markets and the

269
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:18,800
implications of that and uh we'll see

270
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,480
that uh in arbitragefree markets there

271
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,440
does not exist any arbitrage portfolios

272
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:30,000
and what will be neat as to understand

273
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:33,600
why that's the case. All right. Um

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,120
All right. So, we have random uh prices

275
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,320
at the end of day t. Um and so the

276
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,320
profit and loss is going to be random.

277
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,360
uh

278
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,920
I guess it's relevant to note that there

279
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,600
are strategies of of statistical

280
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,079
arbitrage

281
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,320
and those are strategies where we have

282
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,519
sort of portfolio

283
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:03,199
specifications D star for which this

284
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,400
random profit and loss is a distribution

285
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,240
that tends to generate positive returns

286
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,839
and so there's sort of a statistical

287
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,199
likelihood of making money. Uh but it's

288
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,120
often uh not sort of a pure arbitrage

289
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,880
but what we might call a statistical

290
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,679
arbitrage.

291
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,520
All right. Well, let's uh review just

292
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,160
some other concepts of vectors. We have

293
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,559
the norm of a vector

294
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:36,240
being the uh

295
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,039
length of a vector. So if we have a

296
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,760
vector V here

297
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,960
and um

298
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:49,760
the norm of V

299
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:53,039
is basically the length of this vector.

300
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,640
Um and if we consider what the

301
00:17:53,039 --> 00:18:00,880
dotproduct is between two vectors

302
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,600
uh we have this cosine sort of formula

303
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,080
for what the dotproduct is. It's

304
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:12,400
actually the length of V times the

305
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:16,320
length of W times the coine of the angle

306
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,880
between the two. So if we have another

307
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,120
vector

308
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,520
W here

309
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,440
then uh the dotproduct corresponds to

310
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,000
that formula.

311
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,840
And what's interesting about that

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,600
formula is that it actually corresponds

313
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,679
to

314
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:45,039
um the dotproduct sort of corresponds to

315
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:48,559
the length of the segment along W that

316
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:53,200
is closest to V.

317
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:57,440
And so um with this uh dotproduct

318
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:02,640
notation we actually can talk about

319
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:06,320
orthogonality between vectors in uh n

320
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:10,799
dimen or md dimensional space and those

321
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:15,120
can be very useful. um we'll actually

322
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:18,080
see this sort of orthogonality applied

323
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,240
when we talk about regression and le

324
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,480
squares regression. So you may be

325
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
familiar with some of these topics from

326
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,679
that discussion.

327
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,200
All right. Uh well

328
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,200
with with vectors a really important

329
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,720
topic is whether vectors are linearly

330
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,679
independent

331
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,200
of each other. And so if we have two

332
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:47,520
vectors V and W

333
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,320
they are linearly independent if

334
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,640
the only linear combination of the two

335
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:58,080
which gives us the zero vector is

336
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,080
the linear combination with C1= C2

337
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,480
equals zero.

338
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,880
So um

339
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:11,280
linear independence is uh

340
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,799
essentially the case that um we have a v

341
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:19,360
and w that aren't uh aligned with each

342
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:21,919
other in two dimensions um and uh at

343
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,520
least vectors emanating from the origin

344
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:29,919
having that property. And the utility of

345
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:34,960
linear independence is that we can

346
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:39,679
work with a vector space

347
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,400
capital S here. And the definition of a

348
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,960
vector space is that

349
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,039
any vector can be rescaled by an

350
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,080
arbitrary constant C and it's still in

351
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,159
the space. And with any two vectors V

352
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,080
and W in the space, their sum is in the

353
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,840
space.

354
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:02,080
Um with with a vector space what's very

355
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:07,120
useful is a basis for

356
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:11,120
the space which corresponds to linearly

357
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:14,240
independent vectors V1 to VP

358
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,760
such that the only linear combination

359
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,360
giving the zero vector is the linear

360
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,159
combination where all the coefficients

361
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,360
are equal to zero.

362
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,640
All right. Um

363
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,640
well, let's just uh you know go through

364
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,960
sort of all of matrix algebra pretty

365
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,120
much. Um we can extend from vectors to

366
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,919
matrices

367
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:45,919
where we have m rows and n columns in a

368
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:51,280
matrix a a rectangular matrix.

369
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:54,880
And one very useful representation of a

370
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,760
matrix is as a collection of column

371
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,600
vectors that are stacked one after the

372
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,799
other.

373
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:07,760
And so um we can denote bold a sub one

374
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,480
through bold a subn as the column

375
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:18,080
vectors.

376
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:22,000
And with uh matrix algebra um let's see

377
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:26,720
well let's see we can multiply a matrix

378
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
capital a by a constant and we end up

379
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,120
multiplying each of the components

380
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,120
elements of the table of a values by the

381
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:41,520
same constant c um with a transpose

382
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,679
operation. A transpose is simply to flip

383
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,400
rows and columns.

384
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:54,000
And so um if we have a subig j being the

385
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:58,799
i row, j column element of a then a j i

386
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,200
corresponds to the j row and i column.

387
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:06,559
Now um if we think of the transpose of

388
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,600
each of the column vectors in A

389
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:14,880
um that's a row vector

390
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:18,400
and uh our transpose of the matrix A can

391
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,679
be thought of as stacked row vectors

392
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,440
corresponding to the same uh vectors A1

393
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:29,919
through A N. Now, one of the reasons for

394
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,480
thinking of a matrix as having a being a

395
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,919
composition of different column vectors

396
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,440
is that when we multiply

397
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,480
a matrix A by

398
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,880
a vector V,

399
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:51,840
then this corresponds to the linear

400
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,520
combination of the columns of A with

401
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,120
coefficients.

402
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,440
uh corresponding to v1 through vn. So we

403
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:04,799
have a linear combination of a's columns

404
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,520
and uh this

405
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,000
representation of matrix vector

406
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,799
multiplication turns out to be very very

407
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,240
useful. Um

408
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:19,600
perhaps less useful is that if we look

409
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,039
at the uh

410
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:28,480
matrix vector product, it's also a

411
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:32,559
vector of dotproducts of A's rows with

412
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:37,760
V. And so being comfortable with

413
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:41,039
dotproducts is uh potentially useful. uh

414
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:45,520
but for the moment thinking of linear

415
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:49,520
combinations of columns of a um is uh is

416
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:54,400
very useful. So um I guess you know if

417
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,039
we think of the columns of A

418
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,559
corresponding to potentially a basis of

419
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,760
vectors

420
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:08,480
then AV corresponds to another vector in

421
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,720
uh the space spanned by those columns.

422
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,960
All right. Now when we multiply two

423
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,960
matrices together

424
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,480
um we actually have

425
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,520
a matrix A and a matrix B

426
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,440
each with their respective columns

427
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:32,000
vectors and we can basically expand the

428
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:35,520
matrix B into B1 through BP and then do

429
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,360
the matrix vector product for each term.

430
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,760
uh

431
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,279
this is equivalent actually to looking

432
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,720
at element CI which are just these

433
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:52,640
double sums. When I learned linear

434
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,799
algebra decades ago, um I used these

435
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,919
double sums which were not very

436
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:01,520
intuitive to interpret.

437
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,000
um although one with the simple algebra

438
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,400
notation can prove everything but things

439
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,520
are much easier to prove u with this

440
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,400
other notation. Now what's important

441
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,440
when we multiply two matrices together

442
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,559
is that the matrices have to be

443
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,840
conformal meaning

444
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:26,880
we need to be able to multiply a times

445
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:29,440
the column vectors of b. So the

446
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,320
m byn matrix

447
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:39,200
um of uh

448
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:44,159
uh a has to be able to multiply the uh m

449
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:49,000
byp matrix of uh of b.

450
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,000
So um actually I think there's a

451
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:59,760
or let's see yeah sorry n there are n

452
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:03,200
columns in a and n rows in b and so the

453
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:08,559
result is an m byp matrix.

454
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,120
All right. uh well with um different

455
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,480
matrix operations. You learn in linear

456
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,559
algebra all of these rules, these laws

457
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,159
associated with matrix uh algebra

458
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,600
computations.

459
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:27,120
Everything is pretty obvious except

460
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,480
maybe when you transpose a product,

461
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,039
you reverse the order of the product of

462
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,600
transposes.

463
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,600
And if you consider

464
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,600
reversing the order of matrix

465
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,120
multiplications,

466
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,440
if one can sort of reverse the order, if

467
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,720
A and B have the same number of rows and

468
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,960
columns, it turns out that uh you the

469
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,679
commutative law for multiplication

470
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,279
doesn't apply to matrices. So you want

471
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,960
to be careful with uh those

472
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,440
distinctions.

473
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,360
All right. So special matrices. Okay,

474
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,279
there's the um when we have a symmetric

475
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,360
matrix um then it's transpose

476
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,840
equals itself.

477
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,880
So the matrix has uh

478
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,760
basically uh

479
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,279
di well let's see the off diagonal

480
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,520
entries are matched one by one

481
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:35,840
with a j equaling a ji. Um the identity

482
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,360
matrix is a matrix with ones along the

483
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,159
diagonal.

484
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,760
And it can be convenient to represent

485
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:48,880
this as the matrix of columns

486
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:54,799
where E subj

487
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:59,360
is a simple matrix or a simple vector

488
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:03,120
which is all zeros but then a single one

489
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,799
where this is the J row

490
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:11,120
and uh different computations

491
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:15,840
um can be made easy with that sometimes.

492
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:22,240
Now um there's a notation of using the J

493
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:25,840
matrix to be the matrix of all ones. Um

494
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:32,240
and the matrix J turns out to be a

495
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:36,880
vector one times its transpose. Um

496
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:39,120
and we have diagonal matrices where

497
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
it's the matrix is all zeros except for

498
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,720
the diagonal entries which may or may

499
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,000
not be zero and are given by the list d1

500
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,360
through dn. All right. Okay. Well, now

501
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,120
we can turn to some applications

502
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,919
of

503
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,360
uh that use matrices.

504
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,480
And the first one we want to discuss is

505
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:08,480
uh stochastic matrices.

506
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:11,919
So these are matrices um which um we'll

507
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,679
consider uh a stochastic matrix that

508
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,799
square

509
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:21,799
and the columns of a sum to one.

510
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,799
So,

511
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:32,159
so we'll have an a with a1 a2 up to a m

512
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:38,080
or a n.

513
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:41,120
And um basically the sum of a iig j i i

514
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,080
equaling 1 to m is going to equal to

515
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,679
one.

516
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,919
So this uh

517
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:55,440
this kind of matrix is associated

518
00:30:51,919 --> 00:31:01,120
uh with marov chains where we think of

519
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:05,279
there being uh m possible states

520
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:10,320
and we can think of um so we basically

521
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:12,880
have m rows and m columns

522
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,880
and we have this notation

523
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:21,039
AIG or lowerase AI is equal to the

524
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,039
probability that the state the next

525
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:28,880
state

526
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:31,440
equals I given the previous state equals

527
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,039
J

528
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,960
um

529
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:44,720
is given by this AIG. So um so we have

530
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:47,600
um let's see for each column J we have

531
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:52,240
if the previous

532
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:57,039
state at time t was j

533
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:00,320
then there's a transition to a state at

534
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,880
time t + one

535
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,320
and this

536
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,360
transition these transition

537
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,320
probabilities ities uh in some cases can

538
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,640
be assumed to be stable or stationary

539
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,760
over t.

540
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:21,519
Um and with a marov chain we can think

541
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,919
of there basically being different

542
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,760
states

543
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,200
um

544
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,159
which are indexed from one

545
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,480
two up to m.

546
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,000
And

547
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,679
we might think of these as

548
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,919
being sort of nodes

549
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:49,600
in a graph.

550
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:52,399
And there's a probability of moving from

551
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,039
one node to another

552
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,760
for each time point.

553
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:02,240
And

554
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:05,120
um these probabilities of transitions

555
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,480
might be stationary in a stationary

556
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:12,320
marov chain model. Well, if we have a

557
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,320
vector

558
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,799
pi,

559
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:24,480
which is going to be uh basically pi of

560
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:29,039
t equaling pi 1 of t, pi 2 of t down to

561
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:35,600
pi m of t.

562
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:40,240
So this uh m vector pi tells us at time

563
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:43,279
t what's the likelihood of being in any

564
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:48,080
of the states.

565
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:51,200
Then um if we want to compute the

566
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:55,679
probabilities of states at time t minus

567
00:33:51,200 --> 00:34:02,240
t + 1 then it turns out to be simply the

568
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:07,600
matrix vector product of a * pi of t.

569
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:11,359
So this uh formula gives us

570
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:16,159
the model for how the probabilities of

571
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:18,480
states occurring changes from time t to

572
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,240
t + one.

573
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,440
Now

574
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,440
if we consider

575
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:32,000
what is the probability vector at time t

576
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:37,359
+ 2. Well, we have the same matrix

577
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,839
vector model where the stationary

578
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,839
transition probabilities a are

579
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,720
multiplied by the vector of

580
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,240
probabilities at t + one. And we can

581
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,760
substitute in what that

582
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,200
product is, which is a pi. And so we

583
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,240
basically get the square of the

584
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,480
transition probability matrix times the

585
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:06,800
pi vector at time t.

586
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:12,560
Now what's interesting to ask with marov

587
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:18,000
chains is if we start out with

588
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:20,720
a pi zero vector at time zero

589
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,760
and we have the model that the

590
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,440
likelihood of different states evolves

591
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,040
such that the sort of t- period

592
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,880
transition

593
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:38,960
uh probabilities uh from

594
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:45,440
pi 0 to t is given by this formula. Then

595
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:47,920
does this limit exist or not? And so um

596
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,720
let me just ask

597
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,079
um

598
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,720
that question to the class. Anyone

599
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,079
remember from

600
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:04,400
stochastic processes perhaps or linear

601
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:08,240
algebra whether that

602
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,160
has a limit? Yes,

603
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,720
>> if it exists, it's the stationary

604
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,960
distribution.

605
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,960
And so

606
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:23,440
basically if if pi star is the

607
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,440
stationary distribution is equal to a pi

608
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,440
star.

609
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,200
So that we're at a limiting distribution

610
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,839
where there's no change in probabilities

611
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,560
continuing sort of from t equal to

612
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:43,200
infinity to infinity + one. Um then this

613
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,320
would be the formula.

614
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,400
Now uh

615
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,720
are there circumstances where such a

616
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:56,000
stationary distribution doesn't exist?

617
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,400
Yes. Okay. And when is that? I see some

618
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,880
solid nods. Yes.

619
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,920
>> What is periodic? Yeah. So you could

620
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,760
have cycles in the process and

621
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,079
you know a simple case would be two

622
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,839
states that just alternate even odd

623
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:17,839
being one state or the other as an

624
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:22,160
example. So we need to have um asyclic

625
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,680
distributions or or the uh transition

626
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:31,920
pro or the what the mark of chain needs

627
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:35,200
to be as cyclic. Um and uh so uh and

628
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,160
actually it's all these topics are quite

629
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,960
interesting when you study them. Uh it

630
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:48,160
turns out that you can prove that a uh

631
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:53,040
uh a markoff chain is as cyclic if um

632
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:56,800
all of its components of the A matrix if

633
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:00,000
every single one is non zero.

634
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,400
So that there's always a possibility of

635
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,560
transitioning from one state to another.

636
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,760
That's a bit too restrictive. But it

637
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:14,480
turns out that if you consider a

638
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:18,000
particular power of a

639
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,960
that for some power not necessarily very

640
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,680
big but there's at some point of looking

641
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:29,200
at powers of a the a to that power is a

642
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,880
matrix of all positive entries. So it's

643
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,400
sort of interesting just how these

644
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,839
mathematical

645
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,160
uh features um can be shown.

646
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,640
Now um

647
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,599
let's see all right so if it does exist

648
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,079
we have a stationary distribution

649
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,079
um and uh that's that's nice. Um let's

650
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,440
see let me just point out that I guess

651
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,920
in the first problem set for the course

652
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,800
that's been posted that's due a week

653
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,480
from Friday. So this is a good healthy

654
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,200
amount of time away I hope for

655
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,280
everybody. Um we're asking you to look

656
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,640
at some simple Markov chains and explore

657
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:15,680
the stationary distribution of those

658
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:20,960
cases. And uh um the Markov chain model

659
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:27,920
is used for modeling whether uh say

660
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:31,760
trades um at the buy or sell side uh um

661
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,920
or whether trades successive trades in a

662
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,079
stock will be at the buy side or sell

663
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,800
side depending on what the previous

664
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,920
trade was at. All right. Well, let's

665
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:48,160
move on to another class of matrices

666
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:50,240
that's of interest. And actually um

667
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,280
actually before doing that I'm going to

668
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,920
jump ahead just in terms of topics but

669
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,640
um this formula for the stationary

670
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,520
distribution

671
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,920
is a formula

672
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,440
that's very specific

673
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,800
to

674
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,800
igen values and IGEN vectors.

675
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:20,520
And so if you think of the matrix A

676
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,520
having Igen values and IGEN vectors,

677
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,520
what's the igen value and what's the

678
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,520
igen vector in this case?

679
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,640
Does anybody?

680
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:42,400
Yes. Kai value of one. the vectors would

681
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:47,440
be all the five stars are satisfied.

682
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:50,720
>> So, so this so this basically is a case

683
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,119
where one of the igen values is one or

684
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,440
sorry one of the igen values is one and

685
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:01,440
this is satisfied.

686
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:04,240
Um we'll see uh later that um

687
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,560
basically the other igen values may be

688
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:13,200
smaller than one and when you multiply

689
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:16,160
the a matrix by itself

690
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,920
to many many powers then it's only this

691
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,640
one

692
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,760
vector that doesn't get shrunk to zero

693
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:28,000
in the limit. So all right well let's

694
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,440
turn to positive matrices. Um positive

695
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,560
matrices arise in economics where we

696
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:39,359
think of there being say prices of goods

697
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,040
under different sort of states of the

698
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,319
market

699
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:49,599
um or costs of goods under states of the

700
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:54,720
market. And those are all uh positive.

701
00:41:49,599 --> 00:42:01,680
And we can think of this arising

702
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:03,839
um in a single period market model

703
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,880
where we have

704
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:11,680
uh n assets indexed by i

705
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:16,160
and um

706
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,160
let's see we have uh two periods or

707
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,119
sorry two a single period with a

708
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:29,200
beginning and and t0 and t= capital t.

709
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:32,880
And um if we think of what is the

710
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,319
price of assets at time zero

711
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,000
um we may know what those are at time

712
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,599
zero and then what are the subsequent

713
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,240
prices at the end of the single period

714
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:52,960
um capital t and um

715
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:57,680
those prices may or may or may not be uh

716
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:02,079
known. And so let me just uh give an

717
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:05,359
example here with two assets.

718
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:09,160
And um so we're going to think of the

719
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,160
two period model

720
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,880
and we're going to have n equal to two.

721
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,920
And

722
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:22,160
for um

723
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:25,040
we're going to consider um basically

724
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,960
a bond

725
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,240
B

726
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:34,040
which um

727
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,040
takes on values

728
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,800
that will be B 0

729
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,880
um

730
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:48,560
at t equals z and BT

731
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:53,200
at time capital T.

732
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,720
And we'll consider the case of a bond

733
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,079
which

734
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:02,359
basically pays interest at the interest

735
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,359
rate RF.

736
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,400
So this

737
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:14,720
B 0

738
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:17,520
price of the bond at time zero grows to

739
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:22,079
B sub capital T which is basically

740
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,920
growing at a simple interest rate of RF

741
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,800
and

742
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:34,160
um let's see we can talk about RB

743
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,680
the return of this just being BT minus B

744
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:41,359
0.

745
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:46,000
So this is um the absolute return

746
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:49,000
and we could also um define the percent

747
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
return

748
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:57,280
which would be um looking at

749
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:00,240
r subb equal to

750
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,359
the absolute return divided by the

751
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,880
initial value. So this would be the

752
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:12,240
percentage uh return

753
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:17,359
and uh let's see if we subtract this

754
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,880
here we end up getting that this is um b

755
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,280
0

756
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,680
rf

757
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,720
* t.

758
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,440
So this turns out to be equal to simply

759
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,880
RFT

760
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,640
as the percent return.

761
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,560
And

762
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,720
let's see

763
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:44,079
we can also talk about the simple

764
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,560
rate of return

765
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,160
which would be given by um

766
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,640
well let's see actually maybe here I

767
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,800
should write R subb

768
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,960
um and here R subB

769
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:04,960
instead of R subf because I want to

770
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:08,880
define R subf to be equal to um

771
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:14,160
the uh basically one over t the average

772
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:19,680
rate of return. So it's equal to this *

773
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:24,400
bt minus b 0 over b 0. And so this is

774
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:29,359
simply in this uh case um is equal to

775
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:34,079
that rb. Um and

776
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:36,000
I guess I'll be using a notation of

777
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,160
characterizing an interest rate as being

778
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,200
a risk-free interest rate. if

779
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:47,040
this bond is sort of guaranteed to have

780
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,599
that final value. And so um in

781
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,520
quantitative finance we often talk about

782
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:56,400
risk-free rates and um the risk you know

783
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,200
nothing in the world is risk-free but uh

784
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,079
when governments can print money to pay

785
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,800
off their liabilities then it

786
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:09,680
essentially is sort of a risk-free rate.

787
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:12,960
um and we worry less about it uh with

788
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:17,839
countries with stronger economies. Now

789
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:22,319
this is um the first um asset. Let's

790
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:26,560
also consider a stock S which has at

791
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:30,640
time zero a value of S0

792
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:33,280
and then at time t

793
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:40,400
it's going to be random.

794
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:43,680
And so we have s subt is going to equal

795
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,760
different possible outcomes.

796
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,560
And we'll consider a special case where

797
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,440
it's stu

798
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,440
and std

799
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,440
where

800
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,040
we have an underlying state being an up

801
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,920
or a down market.

802
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:11,200
So

803
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:13,040
we have a random outcome for ST.

804
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,160
We're not yet specifying what

805
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,200
probabilities are associated with these

806
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,680
different states. And so there are two

807
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,400
states

808
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,400
at time t.

809
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,599
Omega equal to

810
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:37,040
well maybe I'll just write u and omega

811
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:40,160
equal to d for that and so um

812
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,599
in thinking of a single market model

813
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:48,160
with n assets not just two

814
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:51,359
we are defining basically two assets

815
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:55,839
I guess I'm using j for the assets

816
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:59,599
instead of uh i but um we basically they

817
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:03,520
have known asset prices at time zero and

818
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:05,520
potentially random prices at time uh

819
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:12,000
capital t.

820
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:15,520
And so we can model this by

821
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,839
associating different states

822
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:24,559
at or scenarios at time capital T that

823
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:27,920
are indexed W1 to WM.

824
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:33,359
and uh we then

825
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:36,160
can have uh different prices in that. So

826
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,800
so here's the framework for this right

827
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,280
now. Um

828
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,200
and at least the framework with two

829
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,400
assets

830
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:49,040
and we can also uh characterize

831
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:54,119
portfolios

832
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,119
of the n= 2 assets.

833
00:49:54,319 --> 00:50:01,119
And we can define a pi vector

834
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:05,599
being simply equal to a weight in the

835
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:09,040
bond and a weight in the stock.

836
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,079
units of the stock, units of the bond

837
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,400
given by this vector.

838
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,400
And so

839
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:24,880
what we can then do is

840
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:26,480
deal with modeling the outcomes

841
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,880
of

842
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,960
this portfolio.

843
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,599
Um

844
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,599
if we uh

845
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:42,079
consider sort of v 0 the value of the

846
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:51,400
portfolio at time z this would be just

847
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:51,400
pi b * b 0 plus pi s * s0

848
00:50:52,240 --> 00:51:00,640
and at time capital t

849
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:05,599
Then our portfolio

850
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:09,119
would have values pi bt

851
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,640
plus pi s

852
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:19,040
time s tu

853
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:23,119
for the up case and pi bt

854
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:26,880
plus pi s * std

855
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:29,920
when w is equal to d when the state is

856
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,160
down. So

857
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,359
this

858
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,000
value of the portfolio

859
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:43,880
will be random depending upon the

860
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,880
likelihood of these up and down states.

861
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,599
Well, um,

862
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:54,800
with this setup,

863
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:58,400
it's useful at this point to introduce

864
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:03,559
you to some cont concepts

865
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,559
which is contingent claims

866
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:11,000
and

867
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,000
replicating portfolios. those

868
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,440
portfolios.

869
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:27,920
And so um suppose that we have a um

870
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:32,240
a contingent claim C

871
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:38,559
which has a value C 0

872
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:41,599
um is the value at T equal to zero

873
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,839
and CT

874
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,079
will be the value of this contingent

875
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:49,520
claim

876
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:52,240
depending upon on whether we have an up

877
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,119
or a down. Actually, I'll reverse it. A

878
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,119
down or an up market.

879
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,680
The uh

880
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:12,880
what we end up doing in uh these market

881
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:18,720
models is being able to

882
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:22,000
model the prices of contingent claims

883
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,599
when we can replicate the contingent

884
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,920
claim

885
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,599
with a portfolio of the underlying

886
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,640
assets.

887
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,440
And so um

888
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,760
you know so we can ask does there exist

889
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,760
a portfolio

890
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,079
of B and S

891
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,480
such that

892
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,480
pi B

893
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,480
um

894
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:55,480
V + pi S

895
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,480
uh

896
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,040
T U

897
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,040
um equals

898
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:12,240
C uh CT

899
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:15,520
D and pi B V plus pi ST

900
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:19,000
uh I've got these notations wrong

901
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,000
equal CTU.

902
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,720
So

903
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:32,119
if this were the case

904
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,119
then

905
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:41,520
if so then uh we could have c 0 equaling

906
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:46,599
pi b

907
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,599
0 plus pi s0.

908
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:55,200
and we would replicate this contingent

909
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:59,240
claim payoff at time capital T.

910
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,240
Now, mathematically,

911
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,800
can we solve for

912
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,839
a portfolio

913
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,480
coefficients that satisfy this

914
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,480
contingent claim?

915
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Any

916
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,040
thoughts?

917
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:34,599
Well, let's see. If we look at CT

918
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,599
versus CT U,

919
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,599
and here's the origin.

920
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,680
Um,

921
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:50,319
if we had a portfolio that was just

922
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:54,079
um the uh the bond, we might have BT T

923
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:57,119
here and BT here.

924
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,960
And here's the point corresponding to

925
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,839
BTBT.

926
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,880
And here's the vector corresponding to

927
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:08,960
the portfolio. That's just the bond.

928
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:11,040
And if we look at the

929
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,240
stock,

930
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:20,920
the portfolio, that's just a the stock.

931
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:20,920
Um, we might have STD here.

932
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,799
And then way up here, maybe S TU, the

933
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,559
value of the stock when the market is

934
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,720
up.

935
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,640
And so

936
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:39,920
this would be our ST vector in the

937
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,520
two-dimensional space corresponding to

938
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,520
down market state versus up market

939
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,520
state.

940
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Now given this

941
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,920
figure um

942
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,119
if we think of just

943
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:04,400
an arbitrary point in this space of

944
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:06,799
contingent claims,

945
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,880
can we construct a portfolio that

946
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,520
matches that? Yes.

947
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,599
>> Can you explain what

948
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:19,359
>> Yes. Um Okay. The contingent claim

949
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:22,880
is a payoff

950
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:27,760
that is contingent upon

951
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:30,960
the state of the market at that time.

952
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,599
And it's either a down market or an up

953
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,920
market

954
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,599
over the one period.

955
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:42,640
And the payoff if it's an up market is

956
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,359
CTU. And the payoff if it's a down

957
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:49,599
market is CTD.

958
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:53,440
And in this space of contingent claims,

959
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:58,440
we can draw vectors corresponding to the

960
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,440
stock and the bond

961
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,960
as these vectors.

962
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:15,280
And so what's curious to think about is

963
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,880
suppose we have a contingent claim

964
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,200
that

965
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,000
well let's see suppose we consider a

966
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:25,799
call option

967
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,799
uh contingent claim

968
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,960
so C

969
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,760
well let's see okay so so let's see the

970
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,839
uh there would be a strike

971
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,359
price

972
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:43,359
of uh

973
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:46,799
let's see

974
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:49,599
a strike price of K

975
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:53,839
to uh

976
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:56,640
to buy the stock

977
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:00,000
at time t.

978
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:04,079
And in order for this to be of interest,

979
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,680
we might have K

980
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:10,559
being smaller than STU and greater than

981
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:15,200
ST

982
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:20,640
D. So we have a call option with strike

983
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:25,760
price K to buy the stock and the

984
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:28,640
contingent claim of the call

985
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:33,599
would be

986
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:38,559
zero if uh we have

987
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:44,440
the down market and it would be STU

988
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:44,440
minus K if it's the up market.

989
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:53,280
So we could consider zero in the down

990
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,920
market and

991
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,720
um basically maybe this would be CT

992
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:03,520
minus K here.

993
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:09,480
So this vector here would correspond to

994
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:09,480
the payoff of this call option.

995
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:18,400
So under what circumstances can we

996
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,760
take a linear combination of these two

997
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,760
vectors and get this vector?

998
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,880
>> Yes.

999
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:38,720
>> Yeah. I mean basically we can solve for

1000
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:41,920
this here

1001
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:45,119
by substituting in for this

1002
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:49,359
zero and p minus k and then just solve

1003
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:52,160
it to get our two equations and two

1004
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:54,640
unknowns. So if this system of equations

1005
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:58,480
two equations and two unknowns has a

1006
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:05,920
solution then we can solve it.

1007
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:08,240
And what is interesting um is to uh

1008
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,440
consider sort of what are the space of

1009
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:16,160
all possible contingent claims. And let

1010
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:18,240
me uh let's see just turn to this uh

1011
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,040
note.

1012
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,040
This is on canvas.

1013
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:26,079
But this note that's been posted in

1014
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,480
canvas talks about a one period economy

1015
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,839
with two assets in section one. That's

1016
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,200
what I've just outlined on the

1017
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:37,680
chalkboard here. One can generalize that

1018
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:40,240
to a single period model with

1019
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:44,640
more than two assets. That's chapter

1020
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:47,920
section two. And then one can generalize

1021
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:50,960
to uh not generalize but one can

1022
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:54,319
consider visualizing the assets and

1023
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,240
portfolios in section three here.

1024
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:58,480
And so

1025
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:02,960
what I

1026
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:07,119
do in the last section here is looking

1027
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:12,799
at the vector of payoffs of the bond and

1028
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:16,640
the stock colored differently. Um, and

1029
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:18,960
so this is a bond that may pay off the

1030
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,079
same amount in the down versus the up

1031
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:25,040
market. And the stock pays off more in

1032
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:27,520
the up market than the down.

1033
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:29,359
And then one can consider collections of

1034
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:34,240
portfolios

1035
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:36,480
that sort of weight the bond and the

1036
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:41,440
stock

1037
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:45,280
so that the positive weights sum to one.

1038
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:49,599
And so these vectors correspond to the

1039
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:54,880
payoff vectors of those long portfolios.

1040
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:56,720
Um and if we consider

1041
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,119
well let's see looking at those long

1042
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,400
portfolios

1043
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,720
instead of representing vectors as

1044
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,119
pointed segments from the origin one

1045
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,880
could just represent them as points in

1046
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,440
the space

1047
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,359
and that representation is helpful when

1048
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:19,280
we want to consider a variety of other

1049
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:22,400
uh portfolios in the mix. And so here's

1050
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,880
a graph showing

1051
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,720
the uh

1052
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:31,599
value

1053
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,680
of the payoff. If we consider portfolios

1054
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:37,520
that can invest

1055
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,760
um up to 100%

1056
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:44,799
in each

1057
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:46,319
of the bond or the stock or both. And so

1058
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:49,200
um

1059
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:54,160
if we invest 100% in both we basically

1060
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:58,480
get the payoffs that are really high and

1061
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:00,880
um if we don't invest much uh close to

1062
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:07,440
zero in both then we get the zero

1063
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:10,720
vector. Um but this uh this graph sort

1064
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,400
of shows the contingent claims that are

1065
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,359
mapped

1066
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,520
or equivalent by replicating portfolios

1067
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:22,400
of these types.

1068
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:24,559
And so if we then allow for shorting,

1069
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:30,640
this sort of extends the contingent

1070
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:34,079
claims to allow for negative payoffs.

1071
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:36,000
um which uh

1072
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,880
are graphed here basically over the

1073
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,839
payoff in the down market versus the up.

1074
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:46,240
And what's of interest here, although

1075
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:49,920
it's not quite easy to see, but is um

1076
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:54,400
let's see, there are portfolios where

1077
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:56,559
the initial value of the portfolio

1078
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,119
um is zero.

1079
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:04,160
And so that would correspond to a long

1080
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:06,799
short portfolio that um is implemented

1081
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:11,200
with zero cost.

1082
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:14,880
So um and then um let's see. Okay, so

1083
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:20,160
this is sort of the payoff vector at t

1084
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:23,520
um and looking at the value where we uh

1085
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:28,240
sort of white out those portfolios that

1086
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:32,319
have zero cost. Um now what's useful

1087
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:35,280
here to see is that um with these kinds

1088
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:38,480
of portfolios we can

1089
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,039
replicate different contingent claims

1090
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,680
which correspond to different points in

1091
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:48,799
this space.

1092
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:51,520
If we were able to invest

1093
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:55,520
sort of more than 100%

1094
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:58,400
of our portfolio

1095
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:01,119
long or short, then we could actually

1096
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:05,839
realize

1097
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:09,760
any point in this space in some cases.

1098
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:13,440
And so any contingent claim could be

1099
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:16,319
solved for, you know, with this

1100
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,559
equation here.

1101
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:24,240
And that's rather neat, but it also is

1102
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:26,079
reasonable to consider if we make

1103
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:31,599
certain assumptions on the market such

1104
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:35,359
as as you buy more of an asset, you

1105
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:37,200
don't change the price of the asset.

1106
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,200
There's basically a fixed price is

1107
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,960
suitable regardless of how much. And

1108
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:46,480
there's no constraint on shortselling uh

1109
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:50,000
the asset that you can do that with uh

1110
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:54,319
liberty. So so there are um these kinds

1111
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:57,440
of properties that arise. Now um

1112
01:06:54,319 --> 01:07:00,160
with the case of extending from the bond

1113
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,839
and the single stock to

1114
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:06,079
m

1115
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:10,000
sorry little n assets then everything

1116
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:12,880
generalizes and we end up having a

1117
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,200
positive price matrix

1118
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:20,720
um at time t corresponding to different

1119
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:25,680
payoffs of the individual assets at time

1120
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:28,480
capital t for different states omega 1

1121
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,960
through omega m.

1122
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:34,559
And uh

1123
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,400
with this kind of setup

1124
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,319
um

1125
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:42,000
one can

1126
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:43,760
represent sort of the initial value

1127
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,920
of

1128
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,640
a portfolio

1129
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,920
Q

1130
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:55,520
being the sum of the Q weights times the

1131
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:58,960
initial prices in the A0 vector and then

1132
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:01,039
the payoff of the portfol folio at time

1133
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,400
capital T

1134
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:08,400
is given by the same weights QJ times

1135
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:11,520
the time capital T prices but we have

1136
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,200
different prices depending upon what

1137
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:18,960
state

1138
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:23,679
uh occurs and so um in this case we have

1139
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:28,480
um basically our matrix A * Q giving us

1140
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:32,480
the vector of state dependent

1141
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:36,880
values at time capital t.

1142
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:39,440
And so with this model

1143
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:42,480
um we can

1144
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,000
contemplate there being a an arbitrage

1145
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:50,080
portfolio

1146
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:52,159
where the initial value is not positive.

1147
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,159
I guess one could constrain this to be

1148
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:57,199
zero, but it's easier to just say less

1149
01:08:54,159 --> 01:09:00,080
than or equal to zero.

1150
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:03,600
If this initial if we have a negative

1151
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:06,159
cost that means we get paid to

1152
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:10,560
implement this portfolio

1153
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:16,319
and it will be an arbitrage portfolio if

1154
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:19,520
the likelihood of a negative

1155
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:22,159
payoff is zero

1156
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,159
and there's some likelihood of a

1157
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:28,560
positive payoff.

1158
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:32,400
So this port such a portfolio would be

1159
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,120
risk-free in terms of downside risk. We

1160
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:38,480
never lose money. We either make money

1161
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:41,679
all the time or uh in at least one of

1162
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,000
the states. So this is an arbitrage

1163
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,719
portfolio.

1164
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:52,400
Now

1165
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:55,440
with this model there can be um

1166
01:09:52,400 --> 01:10:01,920
conditions that ensure that there's

1167
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:04,159
there is no arbitrage in the market and

1168
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:08,159
um

1169
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:10,080
so so that's one issue to think about

1170
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:12,640
what conditions would ensure no

1171
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:16,159
arbitrage

1172
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:21,280
And another condition that's of interest

1173
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:23,520
is called market completeness which is

1174
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:27,600
are there portfolios

1175
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:31,840
that can realize any payoff vector.

1176
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,600
So in looking at the contingent claims

1177
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:39,040
payoff,

1178
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:41,679
can we sort of span this space fully

1179
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:46,960
with portfolios of the underlying assets

1180
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:51,040
in the in the market? And so if we can

1181
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:53,920
uh represent any contingent payoff as a

1182
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:56,400
portfolio then we say that the market is

1183
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:00,239
complete.

1184
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:02,880
And it turns out that

1185
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:05,920
the conditions of

1186
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,880
no arbitrage

1187
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,800
are a and market completeness are

1188
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,320
related to whether a pricing measure

1189
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,040
exists

1190
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:19,199
on scenarios.

1191
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:22,159
And so

1192
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,840
think about Qstar being a probability

1193
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:26,480
distribution

1194
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,440
over the underlying states. Omega 1

1195
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:32,719
through Omega M.

1196
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:36,520
And um

1197
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,520
it turns out that

1198
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:41,199
if the initial

1199
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,040
price

1200
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:48,480
of the J asset

1201
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:53,120
is sort of the discounted expected

1202
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:55,440
terminal price of that J asset across

1203
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,400
the different states

1204
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:01,360
then this is QST star is called a

1205
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:06,000
pricing measure. measure. So, our

1206
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:11,520
initial prices equal a discount factor

1207
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:14,080
times the expected terminal uh

1208
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,600
time t values.

1209
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:20,480
Um

1210
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:23,840
if such a pricing measure exists then um

1211
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:27,760
there's no arbitrage

1212
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:30,800
and um let's see. Okay, so it's no

1213
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:34,000
arbitrage if all of the QJ stars are

1214
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:36,080
positive. So if this pricing measure

1215
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,400
gives positive weight to each of the

1216
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,080
underlying states, then there's no

1217
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:44,159
arbitrage

1218
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:46,400
and we say that the market is complete

1219
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:48,640
with no arbitrage if this pricing

1220
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:54,560
measure is unique.

1221
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:58,560
So it's uh it's an interesting set of uh

1222
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:03,199
properties that actually are quite um

1223
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:06,000
well useful to know about and these

1224
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:09,440
models actually underly

1225
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,320
uh uh option pricing theory and

1226
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,800
arbitrage uh relationships in

1227
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,400
quantitative finance.

1228
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:21,440
Um

1229
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:24,080
so um and in this single period model uh

1230
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,880
note that we have distributed there's

1231
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:31,920
this reference

1232
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:34,400
of this book by Albanese and Campoleetti

1233
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,960
uh where they go through proofs of these

1234
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,679
and they can get a bit technical but but

1235
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,640
the basic ideas I think are relatively

1236
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:46,239
um accessible.

1237
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:50,880
Now let's see

1238
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:55,600
moving on um to other applications of uh

1239
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:59,520
matrices um we can

1240
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:03,440
consider systems of linear equations

1241
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,600
and their solution where we basically

1242
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,080
have

1243
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:12,480
m equations

1244
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,480
in n unknowns.

1245
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:27,840
And so um the uh with these m equations

1246
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:32,560
um we have ax= b a b vector and um to

1247
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:34,719
solve such a system of equations. Well,

1248
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,960
one case where we can solve these is

1249
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,719
where our

1250
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,600
number of unknowns and number of

1251
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,880
equations are the same.

1252
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:50,400
And our coefficients matrix A in the

1253
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:54,320
system of equations has full rank. So a

1254
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:57,840
being square and a full rank

1255
01:14:54,320 --> 01:15:00,800
has a determinant that's non zero

1256
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:04,800
and it's inverse

1257
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,199
matrix exists. And so we can actually

1258
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:11,600
just take our system of equations and

1259
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:17,120
multiply both sides by the inverse of a

1260
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:19,199
and get our answer. um when the number

1261
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:23,360
of equations

1262
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:26,560
is smaller than the number of unknowns

1263
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:28,640
then we have an undetermined system of

1264
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,040
equations. When m is greater than n is

1265
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,360
overdetermined and so forth. So these

1266
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:36,480
are different cases that you likely are

1267
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,760
familiar with from your study of linear

1268
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:44,960
algebra. Um

1269
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:48,000
all right uh the uh next topic in our

1270
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:50,960
remaining few minutes is uh let's see

1271
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:56,159
igen values and igen vectors.

1272
01:15:50,960 --> 01:16:00,800
Um when we have square matrices A,

1273
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:07,679
uh we can consider the existence of an

1274
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:12,080
igen value lambda and a igen vector V

1275
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:17,360
such that the matrix A * V is equal to

1276
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:22,400
just the scalar lambda* V. So the matrix

1277
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:24,800
vector product just rescales V by the

1278
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:29,040
factor lambda.

1279
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:32,960
And one can solve for igen values and

1280
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:36,400
igen vectors by just reexpressing

1281
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:40,239
the igen value igen vector relationship

1282
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:43,600
as this system of equations.

1283
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:46,320
And so this system of equations

1284
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,480
will um

1285
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,440
correspond to

1286
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:55,520
uh

1287
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:59,199
let's see this system of equations will

1288
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:03,920
uh let's see can be solved

1289
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:08,960
um by saying that the determinant of a

1290
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:14,000
minus lambda i is equal to zero. And so

1291
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:16,640
um if lambda equals one of the roots of

1292
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:23,679
this polomial

1293
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:27,760
then um that lambda will be a uh an igen

1294
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:32,880
value and one can then for that fixed

1295
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:36,640
igen value uh solve for the igen vector

1296
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:40,560
v that satisfies that

1297
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:42,239
Um now uh

1298
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,960
there are properties with igen values

1299
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:50,080
and igen vectors that are very useful.

1300
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:51,840
Um you know one of which is that um the

1301
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,920
uh

1302
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,920
maximum

1303
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:03,199
value magnitude corresponds to the

1304
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:05,360
maximum length of av for vectors v that

1305
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,880
are of length one.

1306
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,280
Um

1307
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:14,320
and

1308
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:19,199
when we have uh a matrix A that has

1309
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:22,719
independent igen values or igen vectors

1310
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:26,400
then uh in this special case we can

1311
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:30,480
consider defining the matrix S to be the

1312
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,480
matrix whose columns are the different

1313
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,520
igen vectors.

1314
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:38,800
And if you look at this

1315
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:43,199
equation here, if we multiply

1316
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:46,800
the original matrix A by this S matrix,

1317
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:48,640
then each column of the product is the

1318
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,120
corresponding

1319
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,760
igen value times the corresponding igen

1320
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:57,120
vector. This

1321
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:01,840
this equation here is very

1322
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:06,560
straightforward from the notation above.

1323
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:08,239
And if we consider the inverse of this S

1324
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,600
matrix

1325
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:14,320
that exists if the igen vectors are

1326
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:18,640
linearly independent,

1327
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:20,560
then we can write A to be S lambda S

1328
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:27,679
inverse.

1329
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:30,800
And this representation of the matrix A

1330
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:33,920
also gives us the way of diagonalizing

1331
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:37,600
A by pre and post multiplying by S

1332
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:40,800
inverse and S respectively.

1333
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:45,440
And so with powers of a diagonalizable

1334
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:48,000
matrix A, they have a very nice form.

1335
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:51,920
We basically got cancellation of s and s

1336
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:57,360
inverse in the products of a times

1337
01:19:51,920 --> 01:20:02,560
itself. And so powers of a simply are

1338
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:05,199
the same ve matrix s times lambda the

1339
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,400
diagonal matrix of igen values to the k

1340
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:14,480
power time s inverse. And so these are

1341
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:17,600
very uh useful in defining uh state

1342
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:22,880
equations and common filters.

1343
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:26,560
So um all right. So let me just uh I

1344
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:28,400
guess I'll finish there. Um there's um

1345
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,480
some interesting key theorems in the

1346
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:33,199
remainder of these notes. I think

1347
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:35,280
they're pretty readable. Um and I'll

1348
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:41,040
maybe point out these during our next

1349
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:47,520
lecture. Um but um there we are also um

1350
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:51,440
let's see I posted a uh an R studio

1351
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,679
program that computes

1352
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:57,440
uh portfolios

1353
01:20:53,679 --> 01:21:02,080
of S&P 500 stocks and looks at the

1354
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:04,640
changing value over time. And so I hope

1355
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,920
people can sort of explore those

1356
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:11,480
programs and try to use those in the R

1357
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,480
Studio cloud.
