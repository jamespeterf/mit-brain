00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,719
Hi everyone. Uh my name is Punar. I'm a

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,599
postto here at the Shiman Center and I

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,920
will um talk about our efforts to use

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,680
deep learning to identify um regulatory

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,800
interactions that are driving solid

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,880
state transitions um across the

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,480
different um regions of the uh

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,359
trajectories different um

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,599
differentiation trajectories and so on.

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
So many of the biological systems that

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,239
um a lot of us are interested in uh and

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
many of the biological systems that we

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,480
see in nature are characterized by

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,120
dynamic cell state transitions. uh where

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,920
cells move between different functional

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,000
identities like um embryionic stem cell

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
differentiation and development or the

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
opposite of it where with cellular

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,879
reprogramming we have the somatic cells

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,039
being reprogrammed into stemlike state

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,160
or it also happens daily in our bodies

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:05,040
with T- cell maturation and aging and so

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,960
on. So of course um the the there is an

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,720
underlying dynamical process that uh

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,840
governs all of these cellate transitions

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,799
and these are um driven by uh gene

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,320
negligatory interactions. Um so these

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,479
are non-static uh they're contextual and

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,920
they also operate at different scales.

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,200
For some interactions effects may be

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,280
instantaneous and for others there are

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
delays.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,479
So some of the questions of interest

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,840
when studying these dynamical systems is

35
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,159
uh why do cells that look initially

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,280
pretty similar uh in terms of their

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,840
genomic profiles end up um going into

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,439
different uh sulfates and what are the

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
regulatory interactions that are driving

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,040
these uh across different scales of

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,520
biological time. And once we have uh

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,600
insights into these we could get an idea

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,280
about uh how to intervene in these

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
systems so that we can reroute the

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,960
trajectories. So of course the fact that

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,960
single cell sequencing is destructive

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
makes this challenging because uh we

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,000
can't track the cells across time. What

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,720
we have usually is just snapshots uh

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,760
from subsets of the population at

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,800
different time points. Uh but since the

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,840
sampling is random uh we could actually

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,319
very likely um match cells across time

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,239
points because um with random sampling

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,160
we can assume that it's going to be a

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,200
pretty good representation of the uh

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,440
population at that time point. Um but

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,800
now comes the challenge that

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,200
um at any given experimental time point

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,519
we have a heterogeneous mix of cell

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,680
states because cell state transitions

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,239
are asynchronous. Uh they don't happen

63
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
at the same time. Um so we get these uh

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,560
cells across different um regions of the

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,280
landscape. This is actually both a

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,160
blessing and a curse. Um it's a blessing

67
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,879
because that means that with a limited

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,640
number of or with just a few snapshots

69
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,760
it's possible to cover a um large part

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,560
of the data manifold. Um so that makes

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
the um computational methods to infer

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,959
trajectories possible. Um but it's also

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
a curse because that means experimental

74
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,040
time is not the same as biological time

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,239
and also because the uh progression

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,440
speed changes along trajectories.

77
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
So there are a lot of different

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
approaches to uh understand drivers

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
because this is a very popular uh

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,040
problem in computational biology since a

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,360
lot of uh systems are um characterized

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,840
by these dynamical uh changes. But a

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,720
common theme is that a lot of them are

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,720
identifying individual genes and uh some

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,120
of them are identifying drivers per

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,879
trajectory and not the uh progression

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,879
along the trajectory. um but then the

88
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,879
same transcription factors for example

89
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,720
end up coming up multiple times in

90
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,879
different processes or in different

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,599
trajectories within the same population.

92
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,040
So the question is are they uh leading

93
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,400
to different trajectories because of

94
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,760
their uh different regulatory

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
interactions and can we capture that

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,159
from uh the uh snapshots by

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,400
understanding the dynamical process

98
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,040
behind these

99
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,040
cells. Um so our approach is to first

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,479
learn a continuous time dynamics of

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,359
these systems. um we're going to use uh

102
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,120
some flow-based uh models in order to

103
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,360
parameterize the um velocity fields and

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,560
that's going to allow us to learn a time

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,600
dependent evolution of the um of

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,479
individual cells. And given these uh

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,000
we're going to first of all from the

108
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,840
velocity field we're actually going to

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,400
try to infer a biological notion of uh

110
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,800
time and then along that time we're

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,680
going to uh use graph neural ods in

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,280
order to understand gene regulatory

113
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:57,120
dynamics. Um and the way we're defining

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:01,360
um a driver for interactions is that the

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,759
interaction should both be uh strong. um

116
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,160
it could be negative or positive but the

117
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,880
strength should be high and also the

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,840
effect of the interaction. So the

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,160
um so if you perturb the target uh gene

120
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240
that's being upregulated for example if

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,840
that makes a big difference uh in the

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,120
velocity landscape um

123
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,400
then combining these two together

124
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,400
defines a notion of a driver for a um

125
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,280
interaction. So of course ideally we

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,440
would um have multiomic data since that

127
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,880
gives a lot more information into cell

128
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
states and also the regulatory

129
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,360
interactions but we're going to start

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,960
with transcrytoic

131
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,600
data right so what we have is um samples

132
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,440
from different time points right and

133
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,840
what we're going to try to learn is a

134
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,080
flow over these um samples and the data

135
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,479
distribution that the samples define um

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,800
this is similar to the diffusion um

137
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,479
model that a previous speaker described.

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,120
But in our case, we don't we're not

139
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,440
starting from a noise distribution uh

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,280
because we already have data at t equals

141
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,520
z. So we're going to define mixture of

142
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,160
gaussians over our uh data points um at

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,120
multiple different time points and we're

144
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,520
also ignoring stoasticity for now.

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,440
So given this the velocity field that we

146
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,080
learn um basically defines a flow that

147
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,440
takes a cell that's at a specific

148
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,919
location at time zero to a different uh

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,680
location in the gene expression space at

150
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,440
a later time point. And you want to

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
learn these velocity fields such that it

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,800
can explain the data that we see.

153
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,319
And these velocity fields over in

154
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,280
individual um samples also define a flaw

155
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,680
over the probability distributions. So

156
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,199
but we don't assume that this um change

157
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,360
in the gene expression is the only

158
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,039
reason the gene expression will change.

159
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,199
We'll also incorporate a growth term. So

160
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,560
um you could compute these growth terms

161
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,919
from um prior data as in um annotations

162
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
of apoptosis and proliferation uh genes

163
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,440
and that actually helps with

164
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,599
convergence. But we're going to uh we're

165
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,520
not going to keep it uh static and we're

166
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,599
going to um learn it in the model as

167
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,599
well. There's no unique solution to this

168
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,199
uh setup because the continuity equation

169
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,120
could be satisfied with multiple

170
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,960
different velocity fields. So that

171
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,880
requires us to make some assumptions on

172
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,720
the velocity field and we're going to

173
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,400
basically penalize uh long paths and uh

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,319
unnecessary mass destruction. So

175
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,599
basically trying not to make any changes

176
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,000
to gene expression or the u density uh

177
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
distribution unless we need to in order

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,400
to explain the data and this basically

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,080
defines a uh optimal transport distance

180
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,440
in the dynamic setting.

181
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,599
Um, and we also want to make sure that

182
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,080
while we're trying to anchor a shortest

183
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,039
pass, the data flow actually happens on

184
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,240
the manifold. And we're are uh going to

185
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,039
pre-train a a VAE that basically uses a

186
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,319
triplet uh loss to make sure relative

187
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,280
distances in the um neighborhood graph

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,280
based um distances in the PCA space um

189
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,919
is also preserved in the

190
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,759
VAE, right? Um we continue to actually

191
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,360
learn uh update the VAE uh after the

192
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,360
pre-training while jointly learning the

193
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
velocity field because we found that

194
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,919
this really helps with reconstruction uh

195
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,719
and simulation of new data and also the

196
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,039
sharpness of the um partial derivatives

197
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,880
that we're going to compute later on. Um

198
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,200
and that's with both matching densities

199
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,519
and also matching uh predictions

200
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
observed to the observed data after uh

201
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,839
reconstructing with VAES. And there's

202
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,519
just a word of caution um because

203
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
there's no correspondence between the

204
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,160
predictions that we make and the cells

205
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,440
that we see um we're going to use a

206
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,600
Waserstein distance but was distance is

207
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
actually biased in the sense that your

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
probability the entropy of your

209
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,640
marginalss will influence the uh scale

210
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,279
of the distance. So we use the biased

211
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,680
version in order to u make sure every

212
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,600
batch has the same amount of influence

213
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,320
over

214
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,200
training. Right? So before moving

215
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,279
forward, I just want to show you that um

216
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
using linear tracing data set where we

217
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,800
have barcoded cells that encode clonal

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,959
relationships um we can actually check

219
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,560
how well the uh trajectory inference

220
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,360
happens and if you look at all of the

221
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,120
data sets so what we have here is um

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
hematopotic stem cells differentiating

223
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,920
into neutrfils and monocytes. So we

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,480
don't know which cell at the initial

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,600
time point um the late final cell from a

226
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,519
final uh faith came from uh but we do

227
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,760
know that the progenitors um we can

228
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,760
calculate basically the uh faith

229
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,160
probability of progenitors using the

230
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,399
clonal

231
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:02,240
barcodes. Um oh this did not update. All

232
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,040
right. Um my bad.

233
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,360
If you look at the whole uh data uh if

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,640
you look at the whole data set actually

235
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,240
I think it should be because this

236
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,279
was if you look at the whole data set we

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,959
get about n close to 99% accuracy but

238
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,040
the thing is of course making

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,680
predictions along yeah of course making

240
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,279
predictions along the um differentiated

241
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,320
like the final fates u will be very easy

242
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,959
so that's not really a good notion of uh

243
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,440
um accuracy the more difficult task is

244
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,160
trying to figure out what the

245
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,120
progenerous from the initial time point

246
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,760
is for uh each of the cells at the um at

247
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,120
the end and for that we get close to um

248
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
89 uh%

249
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,880
accuracy right so this learns the

250
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,720
generative model over the um cell state

251
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
transitions but one thing that we

252
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,079
mentioned is that u we want to learn

253
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,120
these um interactions over a notion of

254
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,320
biological time and not uh not

255
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,079
experiment experimental time but right

256
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,880
now the velocity field is taken in

257
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,200
experimental time and is generating uh

258
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
samples at a given experimental time. So

259
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,880
in order to convert this into a bi

260
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
biologically meaningful notion of time

261
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,240
we're going to decompose it into three

262
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,279
components uh gradient uh flow

263
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
rotational flow and harmonic

264
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,680
flow. The gradient flow has no curl

265
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,360
curls at all. So this is basically

266
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,680
solving attracted to a specific point

267
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,519
and uh that describes the Wington

268
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,480
landscape if you're familiar with the uh

269
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,720
notion of marbles rolling down a hill to

270
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,920
reach a final state um along a along a

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,360
potential landscape of uh

272
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,200
differentiation. A rotational flow

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,360
captures local cycle. So it's more

274
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,880
related to cell cycle and stuff. uh for

275
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,560
our questions because we're interested

276
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,560
in uh initial cells ending up in final

277
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,600
phase, we're going to use the gradient

278
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,480
flow decomposition. And what we do is uh

279
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,720
basically order the cells on this

280
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,000
landscape and the landscape is not going

281
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,519
to be um a straight line. Uh but this

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,120
ordering is going to give us a notion of

283
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,200
yeah

284
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:19,600
stse. So then what we can do is create

285
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,880
these trajectory specific time series

286
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,920
data um order them based on the

287
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,399
landscape

288
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,279
um and then learn uh train a graph

289
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,519
neural OD in the biological time such

290
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,839
that

291
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:39,600
the changes in the gene expression of

292
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,519
your um regulators um of the regulator

293
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
regulators of a target will try to

294
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,680
predict the uh change in the gene

295
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,480
expression of the target gene at that

296
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,560
time point. Uh for this what we found is

297
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,200
looking at expression itself is not very

298
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,800
useful but looking at the velocities uh

299
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,279
ended up being more useful and we were

300
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,360
able to capture

301
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,560
um biologically meaningful um

302
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,760
relationships and we add a time delay in

303
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,079
order to um also preserve

304
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:12,040
interpretability. um we are we're using

305
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,399
assigned and linearized attention uh

306
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,320
mechanism. I'm going to just highlight a

307
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,480
few um results and I move on. So first

308
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,000
of all

309
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,079
uh in IPS-C trajectory early on in the

310
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,240
um differentiation uh we or I I guess I

311
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,320
should say reprogramming trajectory uh

312
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,519
we found that um there's an interaction

313
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,639
between poxd and foxo and foxd was uh

314
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,800
previously um validated experimentally

315
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,200
to increase um potent reprogramming

316
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,360
efficiency. Um on top of that we also

317
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
see

318
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,279
some interactions that come up for

319
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,680
multiple different trajectories like u

320
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,560
make and kf4 interaction. But what we

321
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,639
see is the dynamic of um when they

322
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,160
influence the trajectory and how much

323
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,279
they influence the trajectory actually

324
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,440
changes for iPSC trajectory. it becomes

325
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,920
uh a highly influential interaction

326
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,880
early on goes down but then comes up

327
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,560
again uh during the IPS-C when the cells

328
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,240
reach the uh pur potency um states but

329
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,320
we don't see that in the neural

330
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,839
trajectory and stromal trajectory it

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,320
goes down and stays low uh relatively

332
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,560
low and um importance of make for

333
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
stemlike pur potent cells were also

334
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
experimental

335
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,760
validated right so when we look at the

336
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,600
top 20 interactions of the very early

337
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,120
day one um or actually day day two is

338
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,839
when they start to um sequence. Uh what

339
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,839
we see is the enhancement of uh

340
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,160
enrichment in pathways related to pure

341
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,560
potency and also down reggulation of

342
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,880
epithelial messenymal transitions which

343
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,480
is the opposite of meenymal epithelial

344
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,079
transition that cells are required to go

345
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:04,079
through for pur potency. Um so this also

346
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,399
um validates our um insights. Uh we look

347
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,000
at a very small part of the regulatory

348
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,839
network and also see that sou and nano

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,800
uh their influence and their

350
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,440
interactions with other um uh

351
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,720
transcription factors go up as we

352
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,000
approach the pur potency stage in the uh

353
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,440
um transitions.

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,720
Lastly, we capture similar um insights

355
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,320
for mouse hematopois where we see that

356
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:39,680
sp1 is a driver that comes up for both

357
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,399
the CMP and LMPP trajectories. Um but um

358
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,880
when we look at the when we don't rank

359
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,120
trae when we don't rank drivers just

360
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,680
based on the gene itself but look at the

361
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,279
interactions as well the uh speed one

362
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,720
gata one becomes the top one the top uh

363
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,199
um interaction for the CMP trajectory uh

364
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,720
whereas gata 3 doesn't appear in it uh

365
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,480
top 10 at

366
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,199
all lastly the gold standard for

367
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,199
basically um understanding that we

368
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,959
learned A good gene regulatory model is

369
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,680
to test out uh perturbations. We there

370
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,959
is a published paper that uh performed

371
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,320
um gene accounts for hundreds of uh

372
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,680
genes in hematopois. So we look at the

373
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,720
um difference in how the relative

374
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,040
population sizes change with knockouts

375
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,360
um and we compare it to our results in a

376
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,959
different data set. um because of the

377
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,279
growth term we can also um now learn

378
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,440
whether the uh changes in the gene

379
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,920
expression leads to a apoptosis. So be

380
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,320
in uh incorporated as well. And we see

381
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,880
that while the numbers aren't exactly

382
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
super correlated, the directions are

383
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,839
very very well

384
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,199
correlated. Right? Limitations. Um of

385
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
course the transcrytoic data only

386
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,279
provides uh um one view of the uh cell

387
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,799
state. So extending this to multiomic

388
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,480
data would actually be very informative

389
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,760
not just only for regulatory

390
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,120
interactions but also um when we look at

391
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,799
um tracing data sets with multi ohm data

392
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:20,720
we see that using both of the data uh um

393
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,919
data resources actually increases the um

394
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,199
predictive power of our progenitors by

395
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,280
um quite a lot. Um and we could also

396
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,120
generate hypotheses on accessibility

397
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,679
gene expression relationships by looking

398
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,880
at the delay jacobian. So the partial

399
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,640
derivative of the um OD after

400
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,240
integrating it for a while. And that

401
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,640
could uh give us now insights into

402
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,440
potentially new interactions that we may

403
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,679
not have uh in uh curated data sets.

404
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm excited about uh the potential of

405
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,960
using this for understanding um a cell's

406
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,640
environment on its spatial temporal

407
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,799
trajectory uh as we have um spatial

408
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,880
temporal data sets now as

409
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,039
well. Uh I'd like to thank Caroline and

410
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,000
uh Shiva for being supportive during

411
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,559
this project. Um I also like to thank

412
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,200
the members of Shimiss Center and Ulab

413
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,840
uh especially Dora who um we I had very

414
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,559
useful discussions with on trajectory

415
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,600
inference early on and uh GTN for

416
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,600
discussions on graph neural

417
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,160
networks. Uh we have time for one

418
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
question.

419
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,240
All right, thanks for the great talk. Um

420
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,640
my question is you know um in in in the

421
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,360
underlying physics that uh it's chemical

422
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,840
reaction dealing with all these like um

423
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,360
interactions, right? Um so that

424
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,120
basically means it's always um

425
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,120
stochastic and I to my understanding

426
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,000
that um you're using an OD model which

427
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,240
all stoasticity is in the initial state

428
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,240
um and I do understand that um yeah

429
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,880
indeed even if you use an SD you will

430
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,120
still have a proalistic flow OD but I

431
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
guess like once you start to use OD and

432
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,600
you admit that there well I admit there

433
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,360
is stoasticity like how do you interpret

434
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,919
like the interaction because you got the

435
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,720
stoasticity absorbed into your into your

436
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,039
um velocity. Yeah. So we actually don't

437
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,600
know the shape of the noise in single

438
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,760
cells, right? So with stochastic models,

439
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,880
people make the assumption that um there

440
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,559
is gaussian noise uh in all cells and

441
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
they place a gaussian noise over the

442
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,280
gene expression data of all cells. But

443
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,280
um that's probably not very

444
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,280
um biologically

445
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,280
um that's probably not biologically

446
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,480
accurate. Um I would expect it to be

447
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,520
more uh cell states uh dependent um in

448
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,600
early u versions not for the trajectory

449
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,600
inference uh part but for the gene

450
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,679
regulatory inference part I did consider

451
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,559
using SDS I don't see a accuracy

452
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,559
increase I see thank you
