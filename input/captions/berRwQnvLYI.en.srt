1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,919
good morning everyone uh I'm calling in

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,799
from the West Coast this week so still

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
morning for me even though on the East

4
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,320
Coast we're getting in the afternoon uh

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,440
I'm Sam wso Director of Business

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,200
Development at Alam energy we are new

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,039
battery cell chemistry uh battery cell

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,320
manufacturer uh really with the key

9
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,279
differentiating factors of being

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,039
non-flammable uh but yet still high

11
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,240
performance and cost competitive with

12
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,240
incumbent lithium ion

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,080
technology just real quick I want to

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,720
show you some of our leadership so we're

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,320
by mes chatter he's a Serial

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,600
entrepreneur has built and exited

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,719
companies in the Telecom industry Krypto

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,200
Varanasi is our MIT connection from the

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,320
uh Department of mechanical engineering

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,000
and then we also have representatives

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,680
from RPI Harvard uh and Industry

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,680
Executives like Mark little from

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,600
GE so in the energy storage uh Market

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,559
the situations is that you know demand

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,000
is increasing across all sectors um and

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,800
the fact of the matter is energy storage

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,199
is never going to become a primary uh

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,880
Renewables are never going to become a

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,720
primary source of power until we have

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,040
energy storage paired along them so when

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,320
the sun's not shining when the wind's

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,640
not blowing you have to have a bank of

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,000
energy that you can draw on uh so that

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,159
we're not turning to fossil fuels um

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
lithium ion is the incumbent technology

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,680
it's it's great uh it has high energy

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,159
density but the drawback is that it

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,320
really doesn't have a suitable safety

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,560
profile for all segments um and what we

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,000
also see in the market is that there's

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,280
demand for more uh longer durations

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
across uh different

43
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,520
markets I'm sure you've also seen in the

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,880
media lots of different uh lithium ion

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,079
fires I like I said I'm in La this week

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm looking out the window at a wildfire

47
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,280
across the way and just down the the

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,399
coast there is another lithium ion fire

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,159
in San Diego which is still burning and

50
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:03,439
you know we also have fires with with um

51
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,119
fossil fuels every day which we we deal

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,079
with and I'm not saying I'm not waving

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,879
the red flag stop everything lithium ion

54
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,119
is is a challenge but the fact of the

55
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,599
matter is that we have to be really

56
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,280
careful about where we're citing energy

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,800
storage systems uh in urban or Suburban

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,360
centers because you can have really you

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,840
you can have problems uh even uh

60
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,680
recently the fire department in New York

61
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,680
has spent over a million dollars

62
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,120
launching a public education campaign

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,879
about the dangers of lithium ion

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,959
technology

65
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,560
so that's where we come in uh we are a

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,120
new chemistry that doesn't exist on the

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,280
market today uh and importantly we are

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,560
cost competitive with lithium ion even

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,879
with recent uh price drops um from

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,040
overseas within the subset of

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,480
non-lithium energy storage Technologies

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,680
we have the highest performance across

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,760
round trip efficiency and uh energy

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
density and the the really key factor is

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,280
here is that we're inherently

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,599
non-flammable and what I mean by that is

77
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,840
that our materials cannot burn some

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,360
other aspects we don't release any toxic

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,159
gases uh and that our materials are

80
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,159
readily available from us free trade

81
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,440
Partners our first product will be Elum

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,680
green uh this is targeted towards a

83
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,760
stationary grid storage Market uh it'll

84
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,120
have an energy density of 3.4 megawatt

85
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,159
hour in a standard 40 foot container yes

86
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,360
that is less than lithium ion uh but

87
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,760
it's higher than all other lithium ion

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,680
Alternatives that'll be available q1 of

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,439
2026 of course we're always looking

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
ahead to Future markets too for marine

91
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,760
and

92
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,120
just a few other things to highlight

93
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,680
about that first product Alum green so

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
uh I said safe stable chemistry we're

95
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,840
not using lithium we're not using Cobalt

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
we're not using nickel all of our

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,560
materials are readily available um and

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
again the key the key factor being we're

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,239
nonflammable and

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,000
non-toxic our battery form factor looks

101
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,439
like a lithium ion cell is built like a

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,360
lithium ion cell so as we scale we can

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,079
use all that existing lithium ion

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,799
infrastructure just without the

105
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,200
considerations for dry rooms fire locks

106
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,200
uh worrying about uh dangerous solvents

107
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,959
everything that we do is processed in in

108
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,239
water um and then looking at the the

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,920
battery energy storage system itself uh

110
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,959
cost competitive high performance there

111
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,880
are some specs the 1.7 megawatt hour

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,079
there is in a 20 foot container format

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,160
uh footprint with 92% DC roundt trip

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,759
efficiency you can also configure the

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,040
system for short duration medium

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,360
duration long duration uh so as you see

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,880
demand for intraday and Inay storage uh

118
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,880
are our batteries are capable of

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,240
that over the past few years we're we've

120
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,919
been focused on uh prototyping and and

121
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,440
scaling up our sampling so we have a

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,600
line a sampling line coming on coming on

123
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,000
end of this year and then in 2025 we'll

124
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,000
be scaling our commercial

125
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,639
production the ask for you all today is

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,240
we're we're seeking Partners so we're

127
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,280
working towards our first system pilots

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,840
in the field both grid scale as well as

129
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,400
residential so we need uh where the

130
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,600
battery cell manufact but we need

131
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,880
partners for integration for project

132
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,080
developers uh oems then we also need

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,440
off-takers so whether it's utility data

134
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,039
center uh heavy industry that want to

135
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,199
Pilot a novel battery chemistry and

136
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,960
Technology uh please reach out my email

137
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,000
there is there at the bottom um reach

138
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,680
out today we have a couple colleagues at

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,919
energy storage conference this week in

140
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,080
La so uh maybe there's opportunity to

141
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,520
set up a meeting today thank you very

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,479
much thank you

143
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,080
Sam um um as questions come in let me

144
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:37,720
ask you you mentioned pilot field tests

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,400
what kind of size are we talking about

146
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,360
so if we're talking utility scale that

147
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,000
would probably be a one container to

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,240
start but with plans to to scale out to

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,360
multi megawatt hour but also for the

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,360
residential scale think like a a Tesla

151
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,919
power wall size unit so um 10 kilowatt

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,919
hours something to power a

153
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:02,080
home okay again a reminder to POS your

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,720
questions to the Q&A chat uh tab at the

155
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,960
bottom of your screen um Tom also um

156
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,720
could you tell us more about the use

157
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,000
cases for utilities data centers data

158
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,280
centers is also a key word coming up um

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,840
and heavy industry for example yeah so

160
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,160
everyone needs energy um and if you're

161
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,919
uh if you're paying high prices during

162
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,800
the day and Peak loads it would be great

163
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,919
to have a bank of energy there that you

164
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,840
can draw on when prices are high so that

165
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,240
you're not pay that expensive expensive

166
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,039
cost or you're not causing the grid to

167
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,520
turn on fossil fuel um utilities like

168
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,919
peer plants which are high power but um

169
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,440
High

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,440
emissions and can you talk a little more

171
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,039
about what the chemistry is um sure so

172
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,520
it's still proprietary but what I can

173
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,440
say is that our electrodes are mixed

174
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,000
metal oxides and then our electrolyte is

175
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,160
uh is water-based so water with salt

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,800
compare that to lithium ion where you

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,840
have um A flammable

178
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,199
liquid okay thanks Sam more questions

179
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,199
coming in so we'll put them in the chat
