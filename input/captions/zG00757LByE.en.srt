1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,640
to me now I believe if you ask me who I

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,399
am I believe I'm a lifelong learner and

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,519
that's what ocw introduced to me being

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:11,920
that idea that if you want to learn

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,260
anything you can simply go and look for

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,880
the content it's probably

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:21,240

ueli and open myself from Uganda and I'm

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,250
Michael Jordan Pilgreen an open learner

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,079
from Memphis

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,520
[Music]

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
Tennessee so Emanuel do you want to do

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,039
the honors of introducing today's

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,239
learner sure today we are going to hear

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,039
from Jerry Vance anguzu an open learner

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,079
from my home country of Uganda Jerry is

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,399
what I would consider a super learner he

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,239
took his first ocw class and statistics

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,680
in 2020 while he was a student at chambo

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,960
University a prestigious University here

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,399
in Cala in the past four years he not

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,159
only graduated from chogo University

27
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,280
with a bachelor's degree but he also

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,040
completed his MIT certification in

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,240
statistics and data science he also

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,360
earned a certificate in computer and

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
data science through mit's emerging

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,240
Talent program which goes to show the

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
kind of drive that Jerry has he not only

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,400
achieved The Bachelor during that time

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,759
but went on to add on more certificates

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,479
more degrees and ocw has been very

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,920
crucial to that Journey so I can't wait

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,680
to hear what the episode well Manuel so

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,399
so he's really done a lot of different

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,479
programs at MIT it's so impressive for

41
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,200
those of you who don't know mit's

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,640
emerging Talent program is a part of the

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,520
MIT Jam World education lab it is

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,360
formerly known as MIT react and you'll

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,000
hear us refer to the program as both MIT

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,439
react and emerging Talent throughout the

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,759
interview calling the program by its

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,119
current name emerging Talent develops

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
Global education programs for talented

50
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,320
individuals living and challenging

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,119
economic and social circumstances around

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,520
the world emerging Talent is a year-long

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,160
program of courses and workshops its

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,280
goals to give participants tools to

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,319
advance their careers Jerry was just one

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,840
of 50 people to be accepted in the 2021

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,280
cohort and he hasn't let the skills he

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,680
acquired there go to waste that's right

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,000
Michael Jerry started his own business

60
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,120
in September 2023 it's called Eva PESA

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,239
it's a banking and investment fintech

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,160
platform that also provides financial

63
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,680
literacy resources to people in

64
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,319
subsaharan Africa Jerry's going to tell

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,680
us all about that during the interview

66
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,000
but I have to say he's really meeting a

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,120
real need on the continent how did you

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,519
first meet Jerry Michael it's funny I

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,519
think both you and I met Jerry through

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,000
Linkedin right after the covid pandemic

71
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,560
and we sat down and talked to him about

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,720
his journey through Co and this was

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,480
before he had graduated from the

74
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,879
emerging Talent program program and we

75
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,440
were just so fascinated by his story and

76
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:11,040
his drive to continue his education

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,840
despite being the sole income earner in

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,640
his household during the lockdown this

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
is such a great conversation Michael

80
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
actually um he talks about doing online

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,799
courses without a computer or Wi-Fi

82
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,799
which is very impressive and harder than

83
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,840
it sounds uh he talks about how the

84
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,080
pandemic affected him and his family and

85
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,920
how he grew from entering data to owning

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,280
a business in just four years which is

87
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,000
impressive Jerry's journey is really

88
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,040
incredible but let's hear from Jerry

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,480
himself here is our conversation with

90
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,480
Jerry vuzu of kalala

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,040
Uganda let me introduce myself in my

92
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,959
mother tongue there's a lot of cultural

93
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,439
diversity in Uganda today I think if

94
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,239
this is the opportunity I have I want to

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,799
say something in a different language a

96
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,239
Ugandan language but probably one many

97
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,720
people around the world have probably

98
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,200
never never heard of so that particular

99
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,799
language is called L I come from the

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,200
northern the Northwestern part of the

101
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,280
country so let me introduce

102
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,280
myself

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Ang

104
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,280
MIT so what I simply said is my name is

105
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,960
Jer

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,160
and uh fun fact my last name anguzu it's

107
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,919
in the same language and it simply means

108
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,240
long journey that's really cool Jerry in

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,800
our first conversation we had when

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,039
Emanuel you and I met just kind of

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,199
informally before this all became a

112
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:54,560
thing I'm interested to go back to

113
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,080
before Co you know when you were kind of

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,440
using open course where but before

115
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,720
emerging talent and all that maybe you

116
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,360
could tell us like what your day-to-day

117
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,199
life was like I started getting when I

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,440
was still in high school or towards

119
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,639
finishing my high school I I knew I

120
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,120
wanted to get a career in particularly

121
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,520
in the financial space to be specific I

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,039
wanted to be a Trader I got to watch

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,080
this documentary about the black and shs

124
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,639
model which really got me so interested

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,240
in the whole financial landscape and

126
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,319
from then I really started going down

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,800
into that rabbit hole then very quickly

128
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,680
you if you're interested in finance

129
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,400
you'll get to learn about the 2008

130
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,440
financial crisis so I try to read very

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
extensively about any kind of

132
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,080
information that I could actually get

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,360
about that whole crisis so question to

134
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,120
me was what do I then pursue after

135
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,000
because I was then convinced like I

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,199
really wanted to be in the financial

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,960
field that's really what I wanted to do

138
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,840
unfortunately there isn't a course of

139
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,000
financial Engineering in Uganda so if

140
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,880
you wanted to become a financial

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
engineer you have to look for your way

142
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,400
around and get something else and I

143
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,960
think to me the closest thing to

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,039
financial engineering at that time was

145
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,000
statistics around that time now when I

146
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,520
started doing the math trying to study

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,880
and all that however it very quickly

148
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,240
became obvious to me that I might not be

149
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,479
able to derive the kind of value that I

150
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,360
really want from this particular course

151
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,560
because so happens that the course was

152
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,919
very theoretical in nature there were

153
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
really very few practical ways or to see

154
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,639
how you can actually make an application

155
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,560
of all these various Concepts that

156
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,880
you're studying so from then I started

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,440
really looking for content looking for

158
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,120
can I get certain types of content which

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
can supplement me supplement me so that

160
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,840
yes I am doing this course because as a

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
person I'd always been a very very

162
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,319
curious person so when I was really in

163
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,039
this point that is when I started

164
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,479
looking around online what kinds of

165
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,479
materials are there and growing up as a

166
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,840
child I'd always known about MIT in

167
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,759
particular because I I was interested in

168
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,560
physics a lot so I kept on reading about

169
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,199
famous physicists and many times if you

170
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,039
read about physics long enough you come

171
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,759
across ideas from MIT but you always had

172
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,720
that kind of aspiration there that one

173
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,240
day maybe I want to go to MIT and maybe

174
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
study from MIT however that didn't seem

175
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,560
to be something which I could easily

176
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,479
realize in the short term so I started

177
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,240
getting into what kind of material is

178
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,160
actually out there is it possible to

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,360
learn from MIT without necessarily going

180
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,560
to campus so that's when I started

181
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,479
looking through and seeing what kind of

182
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,680
content is actually out there and very

183
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,639
quickly you come across the MIT open

184
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,840
coare it's very hard because on the one

185
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,280
hand I have all this classwork I have to

186
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,000
do on the other hand I'm trying to learn

187
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,879
something which is it is related but

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,840
then it's not particularly what I am

189
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,599
studying at the University so you have

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,479
to create your own time to do that kind

191
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
of extra study which was a problem

192
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,639
because you have exams they examining

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,599
you on what they're teaching you at the

194
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,599
University not necessarily what you're

195
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,479
interested in learning so I tried doing

196
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,280
the course but several times I I I

197
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,159
couldn't manage it like you watch a

198
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,720
couple of lectures you're unable to

199
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,560
follow because you've never really

200
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,960
programmed a computer Compu so you get

201
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,080
lost in the weeds you don't know what to

202
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,680
do next so you aband on the course what

203
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,400
happened after you took that course lead

204
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,680
us up to the pandemic and kind of where

205
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,639
you were during that time too the

206
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,360
pandemic happened when I was in towards

207
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,800
my final years in the University so now

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,680
remember like what I had told you

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,759
earlier that it was really hard to

210
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,800
particularly study the course while I'm

211
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,280
also having my class work so to me in a

212
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,599
way the pandemic provided a very great

213
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,719
opportunity because here we were schools

214
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,719
had closed University had closed and we

215
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,000
really had nothing to do just literally

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
sitting home so this is the time I

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,640
really started taking this course

218
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,880
seriously because when I had time on my

219
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,880
hand and I it was indefinite we didn't

220
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,480
know when this was coming to an end now

221
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,200
as soon as I finished the first course

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,360
which was introduction to computer

223
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,480
science and programming in Python I was

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,320
immediately interested and got to the

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,720
second course which I also completed

226
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
during that time of the pandemic and

227
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,279
like I mentioned there reason why I

228
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,440
believed I was able to because finally I

229
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,000
had time I had a computer at that time

230
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,720
and I just acquired a computer then I

231
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,839
get all the time I need to actually

232
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,560
concentrate on this course oh wow that's

233
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,760
amazing uh you mean you are doing all

234
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,480
these classes before without a computer

235
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,600
first yeah yeah give us some background

236
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,440
on that so I I didn't have a laptop

237
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,880
initially what I had was a smartphone so

238
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,640
what I will do is uh explicitly remember

239
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,600
my smartphone a Huawei y330 so I love it

240
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,240
because it was my first ever smartphone

241
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,399
that I owned so uh I used to download

242
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,560
the content and keep it on because it

243
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,240
was very hard watching it online so

244
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,399
funny enough there used to be a place

245
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,560
near where I used where I stayed it was

246
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,600
a university not where I went but was at

247
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,880
Medical Institute so they they had Wi-Fi

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,480
on so uh you know internet is quite

249
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,480
expensive in Uganda so you wouldn't be

250
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
able to download a file of 500 MBS at

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,640
least in that time when you have no

252
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,640
income that's a lot of data only 500 MBS

253
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
don't even talk about about 1 GB and you

254
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,360
know these courses are a lot of content

255
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,120
so what we used to do is uh we used to

256
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,320
run to the the institutes uh outside

257
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,079
because of course they couldn't let you

258
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,600
in so outside there the Wi-Fi could sort

259
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,560
of reach where we could stand so believe

260
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,240
believe me believe me we there used to

261
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,880
be a line of people who are literally

262
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,320
standing on the road and we ter it as

263
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,320
tapping the Wi-Fi in hindsight when I

264
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,360
think about it it might also be one of

265
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,800
the reasons it was initially hard for me

266
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,040
to complete the course because yes you

267
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,320
go through these videos but you have

268
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,440
nowhere to practice it exactly I used to

269
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,399
download the number of apps the number

270
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,680
of coding apps you can have on the phone

271
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,839
but those I feel like are not the most

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,079
effective ways but yeah yeah it's cool

273
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,639
so you mentioned you didn't have any

274
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:47,240
background in any of this what was your

275
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,800
background like what did you study in

276
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,720
high school and maybe as a follow-up

277
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,120
question I know in Uganda most from like

278
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,040
primary we are using English all the way

279
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,120
was that the same case with you as well

280
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,800
or because most of ocw courses are in

281
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,040
English yeah I you know uh English is

282
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,600
the okay I believe now it's not the

283
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,480
official but it's one of the official

284
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,079
languages in Uganda English and kahili

285
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,200
so for me English has never really been

286
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,880
a problem it's something which I learned

287
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,800
from from way back when I was growing up

288
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,800
so that was really never a challenge in

289
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
terms of communication I'd always known

290
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,680
how to speak English for for as long as

291
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,800
I can remember during my high school in

292
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,720
Uganda so you stud a lot of courses

293
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,440
especially in lower high school so when

294
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,839
you get to Upper high school that's when

295
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
you specialize I particularly did

296
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,079
physics mathematics and economics yeah I

297
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,040
always I always love physics like I

298
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,560
mentioned I I thought at one point I was

299
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,360
going to be a physicist I love physics

300
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,040
too yeah and chemistry chemistry didn't

301
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,760
love me back

302
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,399
but it's a whole other story yeah and

303
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,839
just you know we do have a global

304
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,560
audience so I'm curious you know Emanuel

305
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,760
or Jerry if you want to talk about this

306
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,959
how was the pandemic in Uganda how did

307
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,360
it impact you and then how did having

308
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,560
access to online education and you know

309
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,880
we'll get into it here in a bit but

310
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,279
having access to that online community

311
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,839
helped you during that time too when the

312
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,399
pandemic started out all schools all

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,320
Institutes of Education those were the

314
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:28,040
first ones which ended up being closed

315
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,160
right so now when that happened we we

316
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,320
all thought believe like everyone else

317
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,320
that maybe this is something which is

318
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,639
going to take a week and this gets

319
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,839
resoled maybe two weeks at most or

320
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,279
whichever now very quickly uh the

321
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,320
situation starts to escalate it's now

322
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,040
not just schools which are closed

323
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,639
businesses get closed down now this

324
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,440
really to us as a from my experience it

325
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,519
presented a very big problem because you

326
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,920
see in Uganda and uh maybe most of

327
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,320
subsaharan Africa particularly for our

328
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,560
case most people leave hand to mouth

329
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
right so you go to the market you're

330
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,519
probably selling something so whatever

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,440
income you're going to get from that

332
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,320
particular sale of that day that is what

333
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,959
is going to feed you you do not have any

334
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,279
kind of Social Security net or anything

335
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,320
which is looking out for you so you

336
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,600
don't have any savings basically you

337
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,040
need to work to be able to eat you need

338
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,760
to go to work to earn some money so that

339
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
you can be able to buy food so when the

340
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,079
pandemic comes and the economy is

341
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,920
literally shut down that became a very

342
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,160
very difficult period because getting

343
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,279
food itself became very hard because

344
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,240
there was now no kind of economic

345
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,680
activities taking place remember

346
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,199
everything Remains the Same there's

347
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,360
still rent which had to be paid funny

348
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,160
story uh because during the time

349
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,800
actually when the pandemic started I I

350
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,360
was renting out a hostel the University

351
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,680
where I was staying but now because of

352
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,040
the pandemic there was really no money

353
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,480
to pay the rent it was a really

354
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,639
difficult and challenging times yeah I

355
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,720
understand that is when I saw that the

356
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,040
online education it was really a savior

357
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,240
to say the least one you didn't have

358
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,519
schools it reached a point it felt like

359
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,800
there's no other opportunities which are

360
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,839
going to come around because you see

361
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
your betting your entire life and your

362
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,759
entire career on this education you're

363
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,240
going to get this University degree and

364
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:15,839
then you start to know people who are

365
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,880
sick then you start to know people who

366
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,079
passed on so it's something which starts

367
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,800
becoming personal I also come from a

368
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,600
family which has several people in it

369
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,199
which is really a typical African family

370
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,759
they're not really nuclear families it's

371
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,759
really an extended family you have

372
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,600
cousins of cousins of cousins all

373
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,160
staying under the same roof so

374
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
everything becomes challenging all these

375
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,560
mouths have to be fed so there was a lot

376
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,040
of really strain and to me studying

377
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,040
online seem to be an

378
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,880
escape this is a very interesting

379
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,480
Journey you went from just trying to do

380
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,720
these courses on your smartphone you

381
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,600
know the pandemic happens you have then

382
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,800
you get your own laptop then you do the

383
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,480
actual courses on your laptop

384
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,759
very very powerful story you mention you

385
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,160
many at home have you ever like the

386
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,360
things you are learning and this world

387
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,920
that you had been exposed to have you

388
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,480
like try to pass that on or any impact

389
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,560
in your surrounding maybe your cousins

390
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,079
at home you've introduced them to

391
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,519
ocw the person who are introduced to ocw

392
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,320
is my brother he was doing engineering

393
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,160
so I kept on telling him about actually

394
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,720
there's this platform you could get a

395
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,040
lot of content especially from the

396
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,000
engineering side so as a relative that

397
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,560
is the one key person I believe I

398
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,759
introduced however beyond that here's

399
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,959
something which interesting that

400
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,639
happened I done a bit of python and I

401
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,800
now knew and understood a bit of python

402
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,639
or programming in general so people many

403
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,079
of my colleagues actually didn't know

404
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,079
what python was so several times they

405
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,360
kept on asking me what are these things

406
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,959
on your computer what are these things

407
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,440
that you're studying and all that so

408
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,079
that is when I kept on telling them oh

409
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,759
you can actually learn this content

410
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,519
online you can learn this content online

411
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,560
on this particular platform and in a way

412
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,160
over time I started becoming almost I

413
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,920
like to call myself an ocw ambassador

414
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,000
telling people like actually you can get

415
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,360
this kind of education online you don't

416
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,199
need to pay anything you just need to

417
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,160
have a bit of time yeah I was going to

418
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,920
say that's really awesome I was uh

419
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,600
wondering if you could talk a little bit

420
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,040
about how you found out about MIT

421
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,360
emerging talent and you know kind of

422
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,480
after that I don't know when in the

423
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,120
process you decided to be a business

424
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,680
owner but maybe you could talk a little

425
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,240
bit about founding a business and like

426
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,880
how that looks day to day too after the

427
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,399
emerging talent I remember that whole

428
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,199
quote that uh learning from mits like

429
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:43,519
trying to drink from Fire Halls so to me

430
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,560
I really got I got I got hooked to the

431
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,319
whole MIT culture because I could see

432
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,600
there something I've actually learned

433
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,920
especially in terms of how they were

434
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,399
explaining the various Concepts to me

435
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,399
they simplified a lot of things which I

436
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,000
really love so from that whole process

437
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,160
of always wanting to see what kind of

438
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,720
free materials MIT putting there what

439
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,760
kind of resources can I gain from MIT

440
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,160
one day I come across this program which

441
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,520
is called MIT react so I start looking

442
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,839
further into what MIT react is learning

443
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,079
further more about it and MIT react

444
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,799
which is now MIT emerging talents F

445
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,559
about it and I realized that I actually

446
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,880
fit the profile to be able to uh study

447
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,720
here uh study under this program so I

448
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,799
write my application I sent it through I

449
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,080
remember it was a very daunting task

450
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,480
because you had to do a virtually proed

451
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,039
exam before so I remember I had to wake

452
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,840
up very early in the morning to try and

453
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,480
do that and uh after I did the exam I

454
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
kept on wondering if I am going to pass

455
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,880
or I'm not going to pass waited a couple

456
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,520
of weeks and then I received that

457
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,240
message that had actually been accepted

458
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,520
this should be around 2022 when we still

459
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,320
in the pandemic once I received that

460
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
letter that I've actually been accepted

461
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,039
to me now this was this was it I'd

462
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,440
always wanted to do MIT and here now had

463
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,559
a real legit way to actually do this

464
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,640
content so it's a really comprehensive

465
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,919
program which gives you a lot of support

466
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,039
and the community is really very helpful

467
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,960
and very welcoming to really anyone from

468
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,679
around the world uh we were part of a

469
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,840
Cort which only had 50 Learners so that

470
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,000
really gave me a lot of confidence boost

471
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,200
like oh wow I'm part of only a group of

472
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,640
50 people who have accepted into this

473
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,760
program from thereafter we also had the

474
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,400
entrepreneurship leadership boot camp

475
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,320
the MIT boot camps which was really very

476
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,440
insightful which started getting me

477
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,080
excited about the whole entrepreneurship

478
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,679
and what it was because we had a team

479
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,640
where we came up with a proposal for a

480
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,840
project which was called unibody uni was

481
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,880
supposed to be an educational platform

482
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,320
for young kids unfortunately that didn't

483
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,080
eventually come to become a real company

484
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,039
but I'd gotten the key principles in

485
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,000
terms of what a company is what a

486
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,080
startup is I then knew for sure I really

487
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,880
wanted to do entrepreneurship and I

488
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,000
really wanted to apply the skills I have

489
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,440
not just to really do a job but really

490
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,159
also to be an entrepreneur so around

491
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,000
that time I needed a job so I started

492
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,520
really writing applications uh when I

493
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,120
had also finished the MIT react program

494
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,760
one very interesting thing that I really

495
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,520
want to note out is uh I kept on

496
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,679
emphasizing it in terms of my

497
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,400
qualifications putting forth all these

498
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,200
various certificates that I had actually

499
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,919
gained and my MIT react qualification

500
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,799
and this is really what got me into the

501
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,760
interview rooms I'll be frank with you I

502
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,200
managed to get a number of interviews

503
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,000
and I eventually landed on a job with

504
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,240
mopa so what mopa is it's a Solar

505
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,520
Company they have a pay as you go model

506
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,360
for retailing a Solar Products and

507
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,320
mobile devices in a period of about 2

508
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,600
months also I went from being a data

509
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
entrance to the bi Department which was

510
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,960
really the data backend and the data

511
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,360
analytic sides of the business because

512
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,679
that was the field that I was interested

513
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,520
in which to me really now puts me into

514
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,440
the trajectory of this career in a

515
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,880
technical field in data science field

516
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,679
how do you see yourself now ever since

517
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,240
you started doing ocw courses how has

518
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,280
your identity reflecting on a journey

519
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,799
how are you Jerry as a person do you

520
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,320
feel have changed because of ocw I feel

521
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,080
like ocw has helped me a lot especially

522
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,960
in terms of my career trajectory because

523
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,520
I could literally attribute what I do

524
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,000
now what I the jobs I have done in one

525
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,480
or another they they have a direct link

526
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,679
to uh me having to learn about ocw where

527
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,080
that is through the first initial

528
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,240
programs I took to Simply learn

529
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,600
programming or through the merging

530
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,520
Talent talents program so to me it

531
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,280
really broadened my view about the world

532
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,640
I was living in a confined world of

533
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,880
where I didn't know all these other

534
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,480
things existed around the world so to me

535
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,919
that was really transformational and I

536
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,640
keep saying this to me now I believe if

537
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,960
you ask me who I am I believe I'm a

538
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,720
lifelong learner and that's what ocw

539
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,039
introduced to me being that idea that if

540
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,039
you want to learn anything you can

541
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,440
simply go and look for the content it's

542
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:58,440
probably there you can go and use online

543
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,640
materials and then you get to learn that

544
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,039
like in my business for example we have

545
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,039
to start doing accounting recently and I

546
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,440
just figured wait I'm not an accountant

547
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,080
I don't have background in accounting

548
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,640
but then there's online content for

549
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,559
accounting so recently I took another

550
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,400
course especially in understanding the

551
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:15,679
key financial statements for a business

552
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,520
which is the the balance sheets and the

553
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,279
income statement so learning what are

554
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,400
they how they function and all that so

555
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,919
to me that is really the eye opener I

556
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,240
got from ocw that if you want to learn

557
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,799
anything and if you're interested in

558
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,840
anything there's always content that you

559
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,679
can refer to all right Jerry I just want

560
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,559
to give you time to like elevator pitch

561
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:37,440
your business and like what it's all

562
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,880
about since you got the skills that uh

563
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,159
at your previous role when you were

564
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,520
doing the data

565
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,720
analytics maybe just to lead into that

566
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,000
after I do data analytics for a while I

567
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,279
almost start to get bored of that

568
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,440
because I felt like I am being

569
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,679
underutilized I really wanted to be able

570
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,279
to build my own products and to channel

571
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,799
my own destiny I wanted to do a switch

572
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,880
into software engineering which I

573
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,919
successfully did got a role as a

574
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,080
software engineer which really gave me a

575
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,240
steep learning up because I could

576
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,559
already program now I just needed to

577
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,760
make feel that those last gaps

578
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,520
especially in learning frontend

579
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,240
Technologies javascripts react so when I

580
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,039
did that for a couple of months and I

581
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,360
figured that I was now a bit comfortable

582
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:20,960
enough again using online resources to

583
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,039
learn how to c how to to myself when I

584
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,520
figured that I would now do that that is

585
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,520
when I decided that I now need to be

586
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,679
able to build my own products I went

587
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,360
back to my old childhood dreams or my

588
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,279
interest in the financial field uh

589
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,799
looking at the financial crisis and all

590
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,320
that Finance seem to be a black field no

591
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,919
one wanted to go into but when you go

592
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,559
back to the basics of Finance it's

593
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,120
really an enabler to help people so to

594
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,320
us really to how do we best help people

595
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,799
and that is when we came up with the

596
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,760
idea of ever Technologies in Uganda uh

597
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,480
the financial sector is still largely

598
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,799
underdeveloped which is true probably

599
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,000
for the rest of subsaharan Africa very

600
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,440
few people have bank accounts and very

601
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,200
few majority of the population is still

602
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,880
unbanked so they're unbanked in the

603
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,799
sense that they do not have access to

604
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,440
the more formal financial institutions

605
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,000
however they are informal financial

606
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,919
institutions which are available in the

607
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,960
country in which they actually able to

608
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,360
bank their money now these are usually

609
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,360
like the Village Bank the local bank now

610
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,440
one of the key challenges to these kinds

611
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,559
of Institutions because they're informal

612
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,640
a lot of their processes and methods are

613
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,640
also very informal for example the

614
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,200
bookkeeping is completely paper

615
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,360
dependent so what we decided to do with

616
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,600
is how are we able to help and digitize

617
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,520
these informal institutions so how we

618
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,000
able to bring in technology to help and

619
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,559
digitize them so what we are simply

620
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,520
trying to do is to digitize these

621
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,159
institutions and bring them into the

622
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,200
formal line with our banking uh cor

623
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,400
banking system and then what we also

624
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,360
looking to move into is to be able to

625
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,360
provide investment opportunities and not

626
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,320
just any investment opportunities but we

627
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,080
necessarily want green investment

628
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,080
opportunities so that people are able to

629
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,760
invest in sustainable businesses using

630
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,120
this platform Investments have

631
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,120
traditionally been inaccessible field

632
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,000
for most people many people have been

633
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
scammed many people have lost so much

634
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
money because they do not know or they

635
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,520
do not have ways in which they able to

636
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,480
make various Investments because the

637
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,640
clientele of circles ideally wants to

638
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,159
grow so we decided to build up a

639
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,400
platform which can provide for them a

640
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,279
diverse investment opportunities so they

641
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,039
able to one learn about money they learn

642
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:23,440
about financial literacy but they're not

643
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,760
really stop there but they're able to

644
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,760
take action

645
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,000
[Music]

646
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,600
that was such a cool conversation Jerry

647
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,880
really is a superer from ocw to Imaging

648
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,399
Talent he has taken full advantage of

649
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,640
what MIT has to offer and he's now a

650
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:47,559
business owner what's your biggest takea

651
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,159
away from the conversation with Jerry

652
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:54,000
Michael I think for me the biggest

653
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:57,039
takeaway from talking with Jerry is that

654
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,520
just as his name implies learning and

655
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,840
growing and discovering who you are as

656
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,840
an individual is a very long journey

657
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,159
Jerry

658
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:11,720
was willing to stand outside and the

659
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,640
Heat or the rain to download courses

660
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,880
that a lot of us that have it freely

661
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,240
available on our phones would never do

662
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,640
and that persistence paid off for Jerry

663
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,000
and I think it became a beautiful

664
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,120
Journey for all of us and I hope his

665
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,080
journey also inspires others to continue

666
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,760
to persist what about you Emanuel yeah I

667
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,159
I feel you the persistence is what also

668
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,159
got to me you know he talks about having

669
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,200
his fast smartphone a Y3 and I

670
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,279
personally have this experience I know

671
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,640
those are not very powerful phones but

672
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:48,520
goes to show that whoever you are with

673
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,399
whatever resources you have you can

674
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,200
begin from anywhere and you will get to

675
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,760
whatever goal whatever stage thanks to
