1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,080
in this video we'll look at an

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:19,560
application of the probabilistic method

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,960
to extremal set theory extremal set

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,560
theory is an area of combinatorics

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,080
concerned with questions such as what is

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,119
the largest collection of sets that

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,320
satisfy certain desired properties and

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,879
the question that we'll look at in this

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,440
video is the

10
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:38,719
following what is the largest enti chain

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,559
and more precisely what is the largest

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,160
collection of subsets of some ground set

13
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,480
numbers one through n so this is an N

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:51,199
element set so I want as many sets as we

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,199
can such that no none of these sets is a

16
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,719
subset of another set okay so this is

17
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,160
what we mean by an anti chain and for a

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
given value of n what is the largest

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,199
number of sets you can have what is the

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,960
largest L that we can have as a function

21
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,520
of

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,520
n to give an

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,119
example when n equals to

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,159
3 you can have the sets one

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,479
two 1

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,320
3 and 2

27
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,520
three and you see that none of these

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,920
sets is a superet of

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,920
another more

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,119
generally when you take all K

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
element

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:52,280
subsets of 1 through

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,719
n this collection also has the property

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,960
that no set is a subset of another set

35
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,119
because all these K element subsets have

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,240
the same size so none of them can

37
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,680
contain

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,479
another now this collection of sets

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,200
have n choose

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
K

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,400
sets

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,599
and which value of K maximizes this

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,599
quantity and choose K well it is

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:31,160
maximized at K being n /2 or when n is

45
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,400
odd we I can either round down or round

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,920
up leading

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:43,319
to n choose k/2 or the floor of k/2 so

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,120
this is so n choose n /2 so n /2 floor

49
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,040
meaning that's rounded downward

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
equivalently rounded up produce the same

51
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,280
answer so this many sets we can get

52
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,159
forming an anti

53
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,959
chain now this is just one example and

54
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,400
the question is is this the best example

55
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,239
can we do better can we get an even

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,599
larger collection of sets that form an

57
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,360
anti-chain and the classic result of

58
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,360
sperner so spers

59
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,000
theorem says that actually no this is

60
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,200
the best that we can

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,560
do and what the theorem says is that if

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:36,920
you have L subsets of one through

63
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,920
n such

64
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,599
that none of the sets is a subset of

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,159
another

66
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,200
then in fact L is at

67
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,280
most

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,400
n choose the floor of n

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,200
/2 okay so this answers the question

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
that we were asking and in this video

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,519
we'll use the probabilistic method to

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,680
prove sperner's theorem and it's quite a

73
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,519
beautiful proof and the introduction of

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,599
Randomness into the proof is quite

75
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,759
remarkable for a theorem that really

76
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,639
doesn't involve any Randomness at

77
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,880
all what we will prove is

78
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,960
actually the following

79
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,240
theorem which is slightly stronger than

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,400
sperner's theorem and we'll prove the

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,199
following Al also known as the L IIM

82
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,320
inequality named after three people who

83
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,960
discovered the

84
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,520
theorem and it says that in the

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,960
hypothesis that we just set

86
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,960
up we furthermore have the following

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:55,199
consequence if you take the

88
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:58,360
sum over I from one I uh I being one to

89
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,560
L of the quantity one

90
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:07,440
over and choose the size of

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,440
AI then this sum is at most

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:17,000
one okay so let us first prove this L ym

93
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,720
inequality and then afterwards we'll

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,720
deduce spurn theorem from this LM

95
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,400
inequality let's now introduce

96
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,960
Randomness into the problem

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:42,080
so let Sigma 1 through Sigma

98
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,080
n be a randomly chosen

99
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,160
permutation

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,560
of numbers one through n and here we'll

101
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,639
choose this permutation uniformly at

102
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,880
random meaning that of all the N

103
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,600
factorial different permutations we

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,160
select one with equal probability of

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,759
being any one of those n factorial

106
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,280
permutations and now let's consider the

107
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,280
following chain of

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,599
sets starting with the empty

109
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:27,319
set and then the set containing just the

110
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:29,960
first element of this permutation Sigma

111
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,680
1 and then the set containing the first

112
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:39,919
two elements of this permutation Sigma 1

113
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:43,479
Sigma 2 and so on until we add all the

114
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,800
elements into the set okay so these are

115
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:49,319
the set of prefixes of this permutation

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,919
where we add one element at a time so

117
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,960
this is a chain of subsets of 1 through

118
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,319
n and let's consider the

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,960
event for which we'll evaluate its

120
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,800
probability so the event that AI so AI

121
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,960
is one of the sets that was originally

122
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,039
given in the in the theorem statement so

123
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,960
what's the event so the event that we

124
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:18,160
consider is event that AI appears

125
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
in this

126
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,039
chain okay so this chain means this

127
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,840
chain over here now this chain is random

128
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,520
because the sigas are a random

129
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,639
permutation even though the AIS are the

130
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,240
deterministic the AI are given this

131
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,599
permutation Is Random so this is some

132
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,000
event for which has a

133
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,280
probability

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,759
now when do we have ai appearing in this

135
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:51,400
chain or if all the elements of AI

136
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:55,039
appear in this permutation before all

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,759
the non elements of AI so we can count

138
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,599
how many different ways this can happen

139
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,080
so of all the N factorial different

140
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,440
permutations the number of permutations

141
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:08,520
where the elements of AI

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,599
appear first is AI size factorial and

143
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,479
then all the non elements of AI

144
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,080
appear afterwards it's n minus the size

145
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,360
of AI

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,039
factorial and this quantity here is

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,520
equal to one over the binomial

148
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,520
coefficient and choose the size of

149
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:36,800
AI okay next let us note the

150
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:43,760
following that no

151
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,760
two different AIS ajs can

152
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,760
simultaneously

153
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,240
appear in the

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,240
chain why is that well we assume

155
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:09,480
that no AI contains is a subset of

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,279
another AJ and if indeed you had Ai and

157
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,320
AJ both appearing in the chain then one

158
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,279
of them would contain

159
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,160
another so this chain cannot contain two

160
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:25,519
different AIS at the same

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,519
time and therefore these events

162
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,800
meaning these events over

163
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,800
here are

164
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:56,040
disjointed as we run I from one through

165
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,839
L if the these events are D joined and

166
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,959
each of them have this

167
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,040
probability well

168
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,760
the sum of these probabilities then must

169
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,320
add up to at most one and that's indeed

170
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,760
the conclusion that we're looking for so

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,760
the sum of these

172
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,480
probabilities the probability that AI

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,000
appears in the chain in this random

174
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,760
chain the sum of these probabilities add

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
up to at most one because these events

176
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,240
are disjoined from each other and we had

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,079
calcul calulated earlier

178
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:40,639
that the event probabilities are given

179
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:42,279
as one over n choose the size of AI okay

180
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,880
so this

181
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,720
concludes the proof of the L ym

182
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,320
inequality you see the final line the

183
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,000
final inequality is precisely what we

184
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,000
were trying to

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,320
establish and finally let us prove

186
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,399
sperner

187
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,079
theorem by deducing this theorem from

188
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:12,600
the r ym inequality now here's a this is

189
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,600
a quick deduction because n choose the

190
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,200
size of

191
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:24,480
AI is at most and

192
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:27,720
choose the floor of n / two for o i so

193
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,680
the binomial coefficients for a given n

194
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,920
maxes out in the middle we have this

195
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,920
inequality and

196
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:42,680
thus here I'm just rewriting the L ym

197
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:48,440
inequality this sum from um so I from

198
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:51,000
one to L of one over and choose size of

199
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,360
AI this is at most one so that's what we

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,160
just proved and then applying this

201
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,360
individual bound to each

202
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:02,760
term we get L different terms and each

203
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,399
one of them in the denominator we have n

204
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,600
choose the floor of n /

205
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,760
two and rearranging this inequality we

206
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,680
get the desired upper bound on

207
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,079
L so this concludes the proof of spner

208
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,560
theorem it's a beautiful result with a

209
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,720
beautiful proof that is a wonderful

210
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,040
illustration of the probabilistic method

211
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,360
in combinatorics where although the

212
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
theorem statement itself is

213
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,680
deterministic doesn't involve any

214
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,279
Randomness the proof

215
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,839
works by introducing Randomness into the

216
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,279
problem so this is the application of

217
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
the probabilistic method in

218
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,519
combinatorics and is I think it's one of

219
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,519
the most beautiful applications
