Disentangling causation from a mere

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,000
correlation is one of the main jobs of

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,320
an empirical economist. [music] In 1988,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
a Harvard University dean interviewed a

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,920
bunch of Harvard freshmen. He found that

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,320
the students who taken an SAT prep

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
course on average did worse on the SAT

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,600
than [music] those who didn't take a

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,320
course. So, the dean looked at his data

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
and concluded the prep courses caused

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
students to do worse on the exam. That's

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
the dean's interpretation of the data.

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,920
But maybe students with a lower test

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,679
taking [music] ability were the ones

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,160
signing up for the prep courses to try

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,000
to catch up. In a sense, the lower test

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,440
scores caused the students to want to

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
enroll in a prep course in the first

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
place. The point here isn't that the

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,230
dean is definitely wrong. The point is

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,960
that we just don't know what the causal

22
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,000
[music] story is if all we have is a

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,680
correlation between prep courses and SAT

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
scores.
