1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,719
good morning I'm Maher Dak I'm the

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,080
co-founder and CEO of infinite cooling

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,160
uh which uh I co-founded after my PhD at

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,680
MIT with Professor kppa Varanasi who

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,199
spoke earlier this morning and our

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,880
mission is to address um industrial

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,080
cooling towers and make them more

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,240
efficient and the reason we're targeting

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,160
this problem is that cooling towers

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,239
account for over 50% of all uh

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,680
industrial and commercial water

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,399
consumption uh and they are used across

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,520
Industries like power data centers

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,520
manufacturing and uh air conditioning

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,200
and recently cooling has become a major

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,280
bottleneck in a number of Industries so

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,520
we've seen headlines about power plants

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,879
having to shut down because they

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
couldn't get enough water for cooling

20
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,239
we've seen similar headlines about data

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,160
centers struggling to build more

22
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,840
infrastructure in water stressed areas

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,680
and with climate change air conditioning

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,000
uh is growing a lot whether it's on the

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,239
building level or District

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,759
Cooling and all of these applications

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,119
use very similar uh cooling towers that

28
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,479
we

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
addressing so very briefly the way

30
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,439
cooling towers work if you're not

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,439
familiar with them is they take hot

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,400
water in from a process and then they

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,640
cool it down and send cold water back to

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,320
that process and the mechanism they use

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,240
is evaporation so essentially they

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,640
evaporate some of that water vapor uh

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,040
and then some of that water that's

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,920
coming in and then water vapor is

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
generated and then released and you

40
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,759
often see these plumes or white smoke

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,479
coming out of these cooling towers and

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
that's essentially from that water vapor

43
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,759
that's

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,119
condensing so what we developed at MIT

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,759
and now commercialized is a technology

46
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,479
to capture the water that's coming out

47
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,600
from those cooling towers uh to be able

48
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:55,079
to recycle it so essentially we use um

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,119
an electric field uh approach where we

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,880
apply a high voltage electric field that

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,240
generates a cold plasma at the um EX

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,640
exhaust of these cooling towers that

53
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,719
charges the water droplets um in the

54
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,719
Stream and then we use an electric field

55
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,800
to attract all of those droplets toward

56
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,480
the collection surface and then we

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,120
capture it all and then send it back for

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,440
reuse and there are a few ad advantages

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,040
here first the water is very pure it's

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,760
water that's evaporated and then

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
recondensed so it's essentially

62
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,239
distilled or demineralized water uh the

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
second um effect is the plume abatement

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,400
or elimination of that white smoke as

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
you can see in that picture from one of

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,800
our sites

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,920
uh which can help comply with

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,280
regulations uh around those uh those

69
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,000
emissions so that's what we are selling

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,200
on the equipment side and then we also

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,040
provide um uh sensors and analytics for

72
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,879
also for cooling towers so we have a

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,360
suite of sensors specifically designed

74
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,920
for these environments plus um physics

75
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,879
informed machine learning algorithms

76
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,200
that can do real-time monitoring

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,360
predictive maintenance uh optimization

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,720
on these industrial cooling towers and

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,599
the goal there is to minimize their

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,000
energy and water consumption and make

81
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,000
them as efficient as uh as possible to

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,319
increase the process efficiency of

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
whatever system they're

84
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,640
cooling um so let's look at the case

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,080
study here so this is one of our

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,879
customers uh it's a waste to energy

87
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,000
power plant in Pennsylvania and the US

88
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,640
so uh this customer contacted us because

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,640
they had um water scarcity issues that

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,000
were was impacting their reliability so

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,920
they were not certain they could get

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,760
enough water to run their operations and

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,000
they didn't know how well their cooling

94
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,640
tower was

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,159
behaving so we uh started by installing

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,439
our Tower pulse solution which is the

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,959
analytic solution to kind of evaluate

98
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,480
the system and find low hanging fruits

99
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,720
we're able to do a number of

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,760
optimizations there on their water flow

101
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
controls for example we identified some

102
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,439
maintenance needs that they needed to do

103
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,120
that they followed uh followed on um

104
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,000
just after and uh and then we also

105
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,040
installed our water capture system on

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
one of the of their cooling towers that

107
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,959
you can see uh See there

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,480
and within the first year of operation

109
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,519
just to give you an example here we were

110
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,760
able to save them over a million gallons

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,159
or 4 million liters of water and 4,000

112
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,720
megawatt hours of additional um

113
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,000
electricity production due to the

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
cooling efficiency

115
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,799
increase and then beyond cooling towers

116
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,799
another application we started doing

117
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,800
recently is also carbon capture so

118
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,440
actually um carbon capture systems

119
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,919
whether it's point source capture or

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,240
liquid direct air capture uh systems

121
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,080
will use a mist of liquid

122
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,039
uh to contact the air and then there is

123
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,080
a lot of that mist that's released as as

124
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,600
Drift from these systems that's a big

125
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,160
problem so we can use the same

126
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,199
technology we're using to capture the

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,440
water from Cooling Towers also on carbon

128
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,440
capture um

129
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,680
applications so these systems you know

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,199
are already deployed at a number number

131
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,080
of sites across the world so these are

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,800
um some of our um customers in various

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,199
Industries so we work in power

134
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,479
generation all thermal power like we

135
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,840
have customers in nuclear gas waste to

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,280
energy um in various industrial

137
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,320
applications like chemicals um you know

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,479
like fertilizers Pharmaceuticals Etc uh

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,840
data centers Metals Etc and then the

140
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,960
final category is air conditioning or H

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,440
vac whether it's District cooling or

142
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,440
smaller

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,160
applications and um you know the reason

144
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,360
we're here um uh today is we're um you

145
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,440
know looking to collaborate with

146
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Japanese companies on a number of topics

147
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,120
so first if you have cooling towers we

148
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,960
can definitely help make them more

149
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,639
efficient reduce their energy and water

150
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,600
consumption that's a direct uh

151
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,440
application if there are regulations

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,319
around the plumes or the white smoke

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,960
from cooling towers and I know those

154
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,639
restrictions are pretty harsh in Japan

155
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,199
we can uh help address those a lot more

156
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,199
efficiently and then if you're

157
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,720
developing any carbon capture systems we

158
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,039
can also collaborate on those to make to

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,919
solve that emissions problem and then

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,240
beyond Japan you know we're looking you

161
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,720
know at number of projects within Asia

162
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,280
and the Middle East as well where you

163
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,240
know a lot of Japanese companies are

164
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,919
very involved and water scarcity there

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,680
is a huge uh issue so we're looking at

166
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,880
um you know uh collaborating uh in those

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,039
um uh on those projects mostly in power

168
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,560
generation chemicals production and

169
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,759
Chiller plants so you have my contact

170
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,160
information there I'll be at lunch uh

171
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:29,479
and yeah happy to discuss uh more thank

172
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,479
you thank you Mar
