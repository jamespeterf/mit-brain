18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,360
connection with the Institute and this

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,360
connection might come either through the

20

founding team the technology as well as

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,719
through their affiliation to some of our

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,879
peers on campus who vet and support the

23
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,519
