1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,520
in this video we'll look at three basic

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,080
yet important inequalities in

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,640
probability markoffs inequality chfs

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,960
inequality and the turnoff

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,759
bound maros inequality says that if we

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,960
are given x a real valued non- negative

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,239
random variable then for every positive

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,840
number

9
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:41,239
Lambda we have the following

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,239
inequality the probability that X is

11
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,399
bigger is at least Lambda this

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,440
probability is no more than the

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,440
expectation of x divided by

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,600
Lambda one way to interpret this

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,680
inequality is that if x is a non-

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,039
negative random variable with small

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,879
expectation then it is unlikely for X to

18
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,439
be very high okay this is a very

19
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:10,159
important and useful inequality and let

20
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,159
us prove it the proof is quite

21
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:18,320
short we

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,400
can start with the expectation of X and

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,799
rewrite this in the following

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:29,479
way it is at least the

25
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:33,560
expectation of x times the indicator

26
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:37,079
function corresponding to when X is at

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:42,159
least Lambda so

28
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:46,200
this means it is one if x is at least

29
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,200
Lambda and zero

30
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,640
otherwise

31
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,280
okay

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,840
now claim next that the expression

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:06,640
inside the expectation is at least

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:09,920
Lambda Time 1 sub X being at least

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
Lambda because when X is at least Lambda

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,680
well X is at least Lambda

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,360
otherwise the both sides are zero so

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,239
this inequality holds as

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:24,239
well and finally we can pull out the

40
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:28,440
Lambda and get Lambda times the

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,720
probability that X is at least

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,480
Lambda Okay so

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
finishes the proof of Markov

44
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,000
inequality next let's move to chap shfs

45
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,200
inequality the statement of chapy shfs

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,080
inequality is that if we're given a real

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,040
random variable X then for every

48
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,840
positive real number

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Lambda the probability that X deviates

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,800
from its mean by at least Lambda times

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,159
the square root of the variance of X so

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,840
this probability is at most 1/ Lambda

53
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,840
squar let me remind you that the

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,360
variance of the random variable X is the

55
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,560
quantity which is defined to be the

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,799
expectation of x minus the expectation

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,959
of

58
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:33,879
x^2 and it is also equal to the

59
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,680
expectation of x^2 minus the square of

60
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:40,439
the expectation of X okay so this is the

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,439
variance of the random variable

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,640
X yeah so intuitively what chap shf

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,760
inequality tells us is that if a random

64
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,319
variable has small variance then it is

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:59,280
unlikely to deviate too far from its

66
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,280
mean let us now prove this inequality

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
the left hand

68
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,280
side namely this

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,200
probability we can rewrite it by

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:17,359
squaring the inequality in this

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,479
expression which we doing this gets us

72
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,479
the

73
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,880
following on the left hand side we get x

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,720
minus the expectation of X squar on the

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,680
right hand side we get Lambda time

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Lambda Square time the variance of

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,240
X and now let us apply Markov

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,120
inequality right so apply what we saw

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,880
earlier apply Markov to get the

80
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,320
expectation

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:56,160
of x minus the expectation of x^ 2

82
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:00,320
divided Lambda 2 variance of x uh but

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,600
you see from the definition of variance

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,240
the expression circled in red here is

85
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,280
equal to one and therefore the right

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,720
hand side is equal to 1 over Lambda squ

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,000
okay so that finish the proof of chabby

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,000
Chef's

89
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,400
inequality right the third inequality

90
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,800
that we'll look at is known as the

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,440
turnoff bound and unlike the earlier

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,000
inequalities which is for Fairly General

93
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,800
random variables the turnoff bound is

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,600
for a more specific setting namely a sum

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,240
of independent random

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,479
variables and more specifically let us

97
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:43,319
look at a case where the random variable

98
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:46,479
s subn is a sum of N different plusus

99
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,880
1es so each x i is plus one with

100
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,960
probability 1/2 and minus one with

101
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,199
probability 1/2 all chosen independently

102
00:05:51,960 --> 00:06:00,000
at random so one way to interpret SN is

103
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:03,039
that we walk on the number line take end

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,440
steps each step we flip a coin and water

105
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,160
walk either one step to the right or one

106
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,759
step to the left and walk end

107
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,280
steps the conclusion of turnoff bound is

108
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:20,400
that for every positive Lambda the

109
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:24,240
probability that s subn is at least

110
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,319
Lambda time Root n is at most this

111
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,800
quantity here which is e to the minus

112
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,880
Lambda 2/ 2

113
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:37,599
okay so in other words let SN so where

114
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,360
we end up in this walk cannot drift too

115
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:43,319
far away from the origin and too far

116
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:49,520
here means some large multiple of

117
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,520
rudm it is worth noting that rot n

118
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,919
here is the variance

119
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,599
of so square root of the variance

120
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,199
of um s

121
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:06,680
subn so if we simply applied chf's

122
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,680
inequality to S

123
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:14,840
subn we would arrive at the following

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:21,000
conclusion the CHF tells us that the

125
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:24,800
probability that SN is least Lambda is

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,960
at most 1 over Lambda squar which is

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
already interesting bound but the

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,240
turnoff bound gives a much stronger

129
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,000
conclusion right so the right hand side

130
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,919
decreases very rapidly as a function of

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,240
Lambda compared to the chabby chef bound

132
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,120
which decreases only at the rate of 1

133
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
over Lambda

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
squar

135
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,240
okay let us now prove CHF the CHF

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Bound for the proof we'll need to

137
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,759
introduce a new idea

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,360
and this is the idea of a moment

139
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:08,759
generating function so let T be a non-

140
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,440
negative real number and let us consider

141
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,440
the moment generating

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,680
function in this case given as follows

143
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:36,120
consider the expectation

144
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,719
of the quantity e to the T Time s subn

145
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,200
right so instead of considering for

146
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:44,080
example the expectation of S Sub let's

147
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,800
consider the exponential applied to the

148
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,399
random variable okay so this is the

149
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,880
expectation is over the randomness in s

150
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,120
subn well let us now rewrite this

151
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,399
expression by expanding the definition

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,440
of s

153
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,440
subn and we get

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,240
following and the next step is where we

155
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:14,040
crucially use the fact that the XIs are

156
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,240
independent random variables which then

157
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,000
allows us to split this expectation as a

158
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,000
product of individual

159
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:32,959
expectations okay

160
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,160
let's look at one of these terms right

161
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,160
one of these expectation

162
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:43,480
factors well x sub one is + one with

163
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,320
probability 1/2 and minus one with

164
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:51,279
probability 1/2 so this Factor here

165
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:55,079
equals to e to the t plus e to the minus

166
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,880
t / 2 and likewise with all the other

167
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:00,839
terms so the right hand side equals to

168
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:05,200
this quantity raised to the power

169
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,040
n okay so this exactly computes the

170
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,480
moment generating function of this

171
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,440
random variable x s

172
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,240
subn let us now try to manipulate this

173
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,079
right hand side expression to make it

174
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,079
easier to work

175
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,839
with so starting

176
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,320
with this expression for now temporarily

177
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,160
dropping the power of n so just look

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,360
look at what's inside the

179
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:38,000
parenthesis we can apply a tailor series

180
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,000
expansion so by Tailor

181
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,680
series okay I'm going to do the step

182
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,800
slightly on the quick side but I

183
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,720
encourage you to work it out yourself if

184
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,680
you can't follow the step basically we

185
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,519
apply the tailor series expansion and

186
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,839
note that the odd index terms all cancel

187
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:00,040
each other out so again I encourage you

188
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,000
to try out this calculation yourself

189
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,000
we get the

190
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,440
following

191
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,440
okay on the other

192
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:21,240
hand let's look at the expression e to

193
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,160
the T ^2 over 2 okay so I'll see where

194
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,000
this comes from in a second so this x

195
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,000
should be a t

196
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:42,000
so let's look at this e to the t^2 /

197
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,920
2 by using tailor expansion over here we

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,880
get the

199
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,800
following

200
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,320
X each term is

201
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,160
T to the

202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,560
2K

203
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:02,320
over K factorial 2 to the k

204
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,200
okay so this is by writing out the

205
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,800
tailor series expansion for both of

206
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,160
these expressions and finally let's note

207
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:14,440
that even on a term by term basis one

208
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,680
has this inequality by comparing what

209
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,639
happens in the

210
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,760
denominators okay so I'll leave this as

211
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,760
an exercise but this is not too hard to

212
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,680
see this allows us then

213
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,959
to rewrite the previous line by

214
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:37,000
by upper bounding this moment generating

215
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,440
function by the expression e to the N

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,680
t^2 /

217
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,680
2 okay so that's what we just

218
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,800
deduced finally let us use Markos

219
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,880
inequality to

220
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,399
upper bound the probability that s subn

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,279
is at least Lambda time Root n right so

222
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,279
that's what we're trying to

223
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,000
bound as with

224
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:20,639
earlier well previously we squared both

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,079
sides but now let's take an exponential

226
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,079
of both

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,600
sides okay so for this step actually I

228
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,720
think I will need T to be strictly

229
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,959
positive for this step to hold so let me

230
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,839
change the hypothesis on

231
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:42,440
T okay so this is

232
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:46,519
true and then we can apply

233
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:50,399
marov to Upper bound this probability by

234
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:53,920
the expectation of this expression e to

235
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,320
the TS subn which is random and then

236
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,519
divided by the right hand side which is

237
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
a constant

238
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,320
okay and earlier we had determinant

239
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,120
upper Bound for the moment generating

240
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,720
function and plugging everything in we

241
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:19,920
get this following expression e to the n

242
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,920
t ^2 / 2us T Lambda s < TK

243
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,120
n okay so this expression this

244
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,160
inequality is true for every positive

245
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,079
value of t

246
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,399
and the next step then is to use a value

247
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,519
of T that works most in our favor and

248
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,120
one can do this by Trying to minimize

249
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,240
the expression on the right hand

250
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,639
side and you know you can do this and

251
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,320
turns out that the optimal T to set

252
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,839
is Lambda

253
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,720
over root n okay so you can determine

254
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,079
the optimal value of T by taking the

255
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,240
derivative and this is the optimal value

256
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,240
and set T into the

257
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,199
spound gives the desired

258
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,759
conclusion okay so if you set this value

259
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,560
of T into this right hand side Bound you

260
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,480
you will see the right hand side of

261
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,800
turnoff bound popping

262
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,519
out so that's the proof of the turnoff

263
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,680
bound

264
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,519
so the key idea introduced here is the

265
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,079
moment generating function and because

266
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,800
of the independence of the components of

267
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,759
s subm we can factorize the moment

268
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,560
generating function and through some

269
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,560
additional algebraic manipulations

270
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,480
derive the desired bound so all three of

271
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,759
these inequalities are basic and

272
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,839
Powerful techniques in

273
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,360
probability the turnoff Bound in

274
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,279
particular gives an extraordinarily good

275
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,880
bound on the probability that a sum of

276
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,560
independent random variables can deviate

277
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,639
from its expectation and over here

278
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,120
although we only looked at the case when

279
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,680
XI is+ one or minus one each with

280
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,279
probability 1/2 the same proof can be

281
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,759
applied in a more versatile way to other

282
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:24,800
settings as long as you have a sum of

283
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,800
independent random variables
