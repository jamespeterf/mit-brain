disease or IBD as it's also called is

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,599
one of the most common types IBD is

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,519
composed of Crohn's disease that affects

8
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,560
any part of the gastrointestinal tract

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,880
ulcerative colitis that affects the

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,480
colon IBD is caused when the barrier

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,160
between our gut and the microbes that

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,200
live there breaks down leading to

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,200
chronic inflammation and cycles of

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,600
flares and remission before modern

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,039
treatments mortality was often greater

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,359
than 50% common symptoms of IBD include

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,719
abdominal pain

18
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,600

the doctor with a constellation of these

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,479
symptoms but the ultimate diagnosis of

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,960
inflammatory B disease relies on

23
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:12,640
performing an upper endoscopy and or

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,240
colonoscopy analyzing the biopsies under

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
a light microscope these images are

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,280
essential for patient treatment as they

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,400
guide not just the diagnosis of IBD but

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,840
also what drug treatments are best

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,280
suited for the patient and whether the

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,520
patient is likely to develop coloral

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,840
cancer the risk of coloral cancer can be

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,720
up to two fold higher in IBD patients

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,040
but this cancer is actually highly

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,960
treatable if detected during early

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,719
screening worldwide Pathologists have

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,119
collected millions of gut tissue images

37
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:51,079
across hospitals making these images a

38
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,040
treasure Trove of data and an enormous

39
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,680
opportunity for machine learning to

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,000
impact patient Health even more exciting

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,119
the revolution in genomics over the past

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,119
20 years enables us to measure genes

43
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,560
directly Within These gut tissues

44
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,280
showing us functional details a

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,760
pathologist cannot see and providing an

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,640
opportunity to uncover the pathways that

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,599
really Drive disease spatial

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,040
transcriptomics offers a unique

49
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,519
opportunity to look at how these

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,319
individual cells or groups of cells

51
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,879
interact with each other allow us to

52
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,879
identify unique or novel starting points

53
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,440
for Dev veloping better choices of drug

54
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,040
treatments but they're very expensive

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,959
and time intensive to obtain what if we

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,920
could connect the tissue images

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,920
routinely collected by Pathologists with

58
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,879
these less available spatial

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,280
measurements the resulting

60
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,400
highresolution view of IBD could really

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,760
improve patient diagnosis better guide

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,800
the choice of drug treatments and help

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,239
identify and start treatment of coloral

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,560
cancer earlier this is where you come in

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,840
we need algorithms that can connect

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,360
these different types of images taking

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,920
us from the tissue image collected by a

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,519
pathologist to the high resolution view

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,040
of genes that are active in the tissue

70
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,519
and are really driving disease to

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,959
validate your models we will ask you to

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,959
identify genes that are markers of

73
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,440
potential cancerous regions in the gut

74
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,799
and we will then perform experiments to

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,360
test these genes in patient samples to

76
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,959
make progress for IBD patients and

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,000
better detect inflammation and cancer

challenge machine learning challenges or

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,640
competitions are an increasingly

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,280
important way to direct machine learning

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,840
and AI enthusiasts towards scientific

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
discovery in these challenges

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,920
participants from academic institutions

90
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,400
and companies they will develop

91
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,120
solutions for data heavy problems in

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,920
this specific project autoimmune decease

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,920
machine learning challenge we are

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,680
inviting participants from all over the

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,320
world to design algorithms that pull out

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,160
unprecedented information from pathology

97
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,240
images and Aid early detection of cancer

98
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,759
in IBD now this machine learning

99
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,560
challenge is unique in that the

100
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,720
predictions from the top submissions

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,320
will be experimentally validated in the

102
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
lab so your algorithm could actually

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,440
change the course of how we detect

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,560
cancer in IBD patients you might be

105
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,880
wondering is biology experience required

106
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,600
for this challenge it is not we're going

107
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,639
to provide a biology crash course

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,759
together with the data all that is

109
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,240
missing is you and your

110
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,280
algorithms participants will predict the

111
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,280
expression of genes in IBD tissue

112
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,240
starting from the tissue images

113
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,560
collected by Pathologists and highlight

114
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,440
those genes marking potential cancerous

115
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,120
regions then we will test in the lab

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,360
which genes best identify these regions

117
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,880
in the inflamed gut the challenge will

118
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,080
take place in October of 2024 we will

119
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,360
award monetary prices for this Challenge

120
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,560
and the top participants will be invited

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,000
to become an author on resulting

122
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
Publications the code data and

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,080
algorithms from The Challenge will be

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
made open source for the community to

125
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,160
use our inaugural cancer immunotherapy

127
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,039
last year was highly rewarding drawing

in more than 1,000 people worldwide who

129
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,280
appli their algorithms to an important

130
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,319
biological question and we now invite

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,919
you to this new challenge your work May

132
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,240
add a crucial stepping stone to the

133
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,280
great scientific quest of improving
