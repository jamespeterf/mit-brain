1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,759
so I'm currently in um I'm in Houston

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,519
Texas for a conference called drilling

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,440
for hydrogen and I'll talk a little bit

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,280
about uh why that is and what's exciting

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,439
about it um before then Paris from a CEO

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,199
actually founder Eden um I did my PhD in

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:26,000
the MIT hulie joint program uh course 12

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,519
just graduated last year and uh started

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,080
this company actually while also a PhD

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,719
student and what we're developing is

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,559
technology to unlock um self-surface

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,360
resources you have heat underground you

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,920
have natural deposits of page

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,039
underground people didn't actually know

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,879
that um you have minerals on the ground

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,640
you have all the gas on the ground you

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,960
have the ability potentially um and CO2

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,640
underground but all of these things

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,359
require a rock fracturing technology to

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,239
allow you to access the subsurface um

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,399
the traditional way of fracturing walks

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,399
is with a technology that a lot of

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,760
people are familiar with called

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,040
hydraulic fracturing you inject very

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,960
high pressure water into the subsurface

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,720
um this water is used to create tinell

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,080
stresses in the Rock but has

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,680
environmental issues from um induced

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,040
sity to uh contaminating your your

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,240
groundwater so now residents around

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,400
hydraulic fracturing operations you know

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,479
don't have clean drinking water um

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,119
because of this a lot of uh States and a

34
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,079
lot of countries have actually banned

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,840
hydraulic fracturing um so what we're

36
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,040
developing and our technology is a new

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,880
fracture mechanism instead of using high

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,079
pressure water we're using electric

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,680
hosis and I've been studying this

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,640
mechanism for the past four years um you

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,280
get very similar phenomena of creating

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
fractures in the Rock if you get high

43
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,479
enough voltage into the Rock um but the

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,119
benefits are you can reduce or eliminate

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,360
the generation of earthquakes that

46
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,920
happen due to lubricating Eves when you

47
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,439
inject fluids and you can mitigate the

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
groundwater contamination issues you

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,399
might have because you're not exchanging

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,360
water um so the way our technology works

51
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,879
is that we put electrodes into well bars

52
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,399
deep on the ground um we apply uh

53
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,840
voltages very high think hundreds of

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,920
thousands millions of volts into the

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,200
rock until you start to generate thermal

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,840
stresses in the Rock and The Rock begins

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,000
to fill um this technology has

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,080
applications across pretty much any Rock

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,720
and any Reservoir that you want to go to

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,760
from geothermal geologic hydren from and

61
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,280
carbon storage uh you need to have

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,959
fractures in the subsurface uh we've

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,120
receiv received multiple Awards by the

64
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,519
US Department of energy for essentially

65
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,160
all of these markets um because the

66
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,480
technology could be that powerful when

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,599
unlocking these natural

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,000
resources so where we are in our

69
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,920
development you know this isn't just a

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,280
theory we're not just drawing cartoons

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,519
of electricity and and and hoping that

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,920
we can have mechanisms happen we've

73
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,680
actually done it so last year we we took

74
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,840
the team you can see these are two of

75
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,519
our Engineers we worked with the oil and

76
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,120
gas company and we deploy our technology

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,000
and we put these electrodes that we

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,159
manufactured designed ourselves deep

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,400
into the well uh we turned on um the

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
electricity um and then we modulated how

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,280
much energy was going into the Rock uh

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
we did this over the course of two weeks

83
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,799
and we saw a significant increase in

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
production from this Reservoir um the

85
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,080
the well was initially producing 20

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,959
barrels of oil per day uh we went there

87
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,799
we did our stimulation job and then we

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,319
left measured uh production again and

89
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,400
production increased uh to over 100

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,720
barrels of oil coming out per day

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,439
um so the the the operator here uh they

92
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,920
paid for the pilot operation and they

93
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,120
made money off of this pilot um what was

94
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,680
really unique about the the pl of the

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,519
technology was that we did this we

96
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,080
increased production using uh zero

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,040
gallons of water we did not inject a

98
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,200
single drop of water into the subsurface

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,920
while we were stimulating this Reservoir

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
so we were very excited about um the

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,079
potential for the technology has been

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,760
proven in oil and gas res now we're

103
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,560
looking at one the technology in

104
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,400
different geological ours so what we

105
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,799
have coming up are additional projects

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,040
uh with the um sponsored by the doe you

107
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,239
are technology for geothermal

108
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,879
applications and granite in the US we

109
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,880
have customers in the Middle East North

110
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,040
Africa you are adop our technology um we

111
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,880
have uh we signed our company actually

112
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,400
signed the world's first mou uh for

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,600
geological production um and we we

114
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,199
signed this with the Omani government

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,440
last year and we're looking at doing

116
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,520
that project

117
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,720
with them we drill Wells we use our

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,880
technology to fracture the reservoir um

119
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,440
and then we show the increase of

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,840
hydrogen production coming out um

121
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,039
sometime later next year we also have

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,280
multiple contracts with mining companies

123
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,759
um who need to have their their their

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,280
mining fracture in order for them to uh

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,120
decrease the amount of energy uh

126
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,120
required to then grind out the the

127
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,320
minerals from these rocks so we have a a

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
lot of really unique use cases all

129
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,639
related to the energy transition for the

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,680
technology so what we're looking for are

131
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,960
people who own Wells um if if you own

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,400
Wells or you have access to um or with

133
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,440
networks of people within mining G hogen

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,919
geothermal Caron storage or traditional

135
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:19,960
oil and gas uh these are all markets

136
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:22,440
that our technology um can play in so

137
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,440
thanks thank you

138
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Paris um let me start with a question

139
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,600
here um you talked a little bit about it

140
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,400
but where have you seen more traction if

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,080
you could expand a little on

142
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,000
that so the easiest thing for us to do

143
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,440
is deploy an oil and gas well um just

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,800
because the market is so big uh that

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,120
that's the biggest Market but we

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,080
actually received the most traction um

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
in the mining industry there have been a

148
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,960
lot of innovation and mining companies

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,800
who have these groups that are actively

150
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,960
looking to sponsor startups um to help

151
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,360
them uh increase their mineral yield

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,960
because their ores are degrading um and

153
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,680
they have a really key Ro of play the

154
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,240
anyg transition to provide critical

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,840
minerals for solar wind and other kind

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
of uh applications so a lot of the

157
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:13,319
traction recently has

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,960
been okay thank you and um what is the

159
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,199
energy requirement to create fractures

160
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,440
in a lateral 3

161
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,319
kilometer that's a great question uh in

162
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,680
our Pilot We consumed uh less than 100

163
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,840
megawatts of

164
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,520
energy um so know at $100 per megawatt

165
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,199
you know talking 10,000 record of

166
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:39,360
electricity um back

167
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,360
soon by thank you thanks
