1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
My research has always been at the

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,640
intersection of engineering and biology.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,760
And I think people often underestimate

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,160
what biology can do. So my lab looks a

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,880
lot at the natural environment and the

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,840
microbes that are there. And they can do

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,160
pretty much any chemical process that we

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,600
want to do and that chemical engineers

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,560
have been working for hundreds of years

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,960
to try to accomplish, but they can do it

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
more efficiently and in a living

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
organism that can also stay alive while

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,680
it's doing that. So if we look to those

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,079
systems that have this uh head start on

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,719
us through evolution then we can come up

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,719
with simpler solutions.
