student body is

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,159
international it comprises of five

28
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,880
schools and one college you have the

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,400
School of Engineering School of Science

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,840
uh management um School of Management

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,799
SLO School school um School of

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,799
humanities arts and social sciences uh

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,399
School of Architecture and planning and

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,399
the College of

35
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,000
computing but what does it do in terms

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,960
of all these things comprise in terms of

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,439
65 re 6 65 plus because we can never

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,439
keep track of exactly how many they are

39
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,719
um research Labs centers and programs um

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,320
$840 million on campus sponsored

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,560
research 20 % of those come from

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,799
industry sponsors and many of which

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:12,599
comes from members uh of the ILP program

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:17,560
um 592 us patents filed uh in 23 fi23 uh

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:22,200
362 uh patents issued uh in fi23 $4.2

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,840
million in licensing revenue and 23 MIT

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,760
companies startup uh started up using

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,760
MIT um uh intellectual property

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,640
this is of course MIT is doing wonderful

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,120
groundbreaking research in many many

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,200
areas but these are the three areas

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,159
where our president is you know for you

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,680
know forging a path ahead for us to

54
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,239
focus on changing world problems and US

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,200
solving them so that is climate and

56
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,959
sustainability life sciences and

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,640
AI how do we do this we do it by

58
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,560
innovating we do it by our

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,400
groundbreaking research but Innovation

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,159
right and of course when you talk about

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Innovation Innovation means different

62
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,840
things to different people but how do we

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,720
Define innovation we at MIT Define

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,200
innovation as the process of taking

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,879
ideas from inception to impact and the

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,480
word impact is so important and that's

67
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:26,680
what we do every day each person at MIT

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:29,120
in our own ways try to make ideas um

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,760
from you know uh ideas from inception to

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,760
impact

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,840
now what do we do we are the industry

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,159
Leone program and what do we do we we

73
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,840
try to bridge the gap between industry

74
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,480
and academic research at MIT and so how

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,159
do we do it we have the way of thinking

76
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,840
about it in four brackets one is

77
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,079
research Innovation students and

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,079
education but how do we Bridge those

79
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,519
gaps is through understanding and

80
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,400
learning for our ILP member companies

81
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,640
and how they can learn learn about The

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,680
Cutting Edge um research happening

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,840
through webinars conferences through

84
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,760
executive briefings through um uh

85
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,400
professional education through exec Ed

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,600
and many other opportunities happening

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,280
through open learning you can learn and

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,120
discover Pro problems or discover new um

89
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,199
ideas and opportunities and you can we

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,400
can facilitate that through faculty

91
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,160
meetings meetings with labs and centers

92
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,520

visiting Scholars and IP licensing and

97
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,680
