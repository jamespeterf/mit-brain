00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,480
Hi everyone, I'm Tiffens representing

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,320
Inspe today as a chief of staff. So at

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,559
Inspe we are developing the next

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,400
generation or sensor for synthetic

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,599
biology

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,320
based on our CEO Jerum mission patent

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,359
during his lab at MIT integrate futonic.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,760
We have developed the first ramen system

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,279
for bio production industry who is

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,560
facing a huge bottleneck.

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,719
Whether it is for meat, medicine or

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,800
sustainable materials,

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,079
synthetic bio production is still a

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,719
black bust. Up to 30% of engine therapy

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,239
batches fail in manufacturing and more

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,440
than 90% of synthetic technology never

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,160
scale beyond the lab. But why? Because

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,920
we are lacking visibility.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,320
We don't know what's happening inside

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,199
our bioreactors.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,760
So at inspec we are bringing light into

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,719
those black box by measuring lot of

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,840
information directly inside bioreactors

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,080
and that's what optic is good at. So we

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,280
are developing optical properties on the

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,000
chips with spectroscopy

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,920
fuescent absorb absorption or

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,799
reflection. We are monitoring

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,400
temperature, chemicals, biomass or pH

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,680
temperature and inside bioreactors

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,560
and so we provide at inspec multipar

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,200
sensor on one probe compatible with

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,600
single use at all scales of your R&D

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,600
process for inline monitoring.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,920
To summarize what we are doing at inspec

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
it's optimizing your bio process with

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
data that we are giving with our unique

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,320
solution and providing a dashboard to

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,119
fully visual visualize all your data

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,000
processes

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,119
and you can see here in action with our

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,640
reable ramen specs sensor directly

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,799
inside a yes fermentation over 5 days.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,960
With this proof of concept, we were able

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,520
to monitor the molecule of interest in

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,400
the concentration range with an average

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,520
error that we are still working on. For

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,080
that, we acquire with a reusable ramen

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,319
over 70,000

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,000
spectra over five runs in order to

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,920
create this PLS model. This models

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,040
allows to estimate the correlation

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,239
between established concentration and

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,480
real one. For that we have monitored

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,239
different molecules of the interest and

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,720
double the reaction yield.

57
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,319
Our typical use case in partnerships are

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,640
chemicals monitoring in complex

59
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,000
environment or data generation for AI

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,720
modeling for in biochemistry.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,440
The industry we are working with are

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,120
farmer agri food or cosmetics. We

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,200
already have all the proof of concept

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,000
ongoing with number food or pharma

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,400
companies all over the world in Europe

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,040
and US.

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,440
Our partnership take two forms pilot

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,760
testing where we first test the molecule

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,319
of your interest in our lab in Paris and

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,879
then come into your site or more

71
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,200
long-term code development to adapt our

72
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,159
technology to your special needs of your

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,400
industrial companies.

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,800
If these challenges resonate with your

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,360
company's bio monitoring issues, then we

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,640
inspect team would be happy to develop

77
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,640
it with you.
