00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,840
Originally from Africa, I grew up in America 
and I always had the love of going back. When  

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,200
I went back, I worked as a software developer, I 
worked as a entrepreneur, I started a business,  

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,760
and I worked as a policy adviser in government. I 
got to see the country from many different angles.  

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,400
One of the things I realized, the economic 
models that I studied while I was in college,  

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,360
I didn't have the opportunity to learn 
how to apply those models to these poor  

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,200
contexts. And that's what the DEDP program has 
done for me. It has taken the everyday lives  

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,200
of the people around me and has turned that 
into so much more. It's given me the tools,  

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,520
the frameworks to really understand 
their lives from a deeper perspective.  

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,520
MIT is one of the top universities in the 
world. By studying in this DEDP program,  

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,280
you can do very great things for your life, and in 
turn, you can do very great things for the world.
