1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,040
So, thank you for having us today. Um,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,680
my name is Sasha. I'm from Ver. Our

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,599
founder and CEO, Tim Hidel, is an MIT

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,400
alum and we're a proud part of the

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,920
engine community. At VER, we're

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,560
addressing one of the most urgent

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,640
challenges in the data center industry.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,880
We're overcoming p power delivery

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,560
bottlenecks that limit speed and scale.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
The growth of AI is powered by

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,439
electricity and the demand for

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,279
electrical power is soaring. But today's

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,760
conventional technologies such as copper

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,239
cables and bus bars can't support the

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,719
megawatt class racks already on the

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,079
horizon seen here from the Nvidia road

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,559
map. The infrastructure required to

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
distribute that power can't accommodate

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,399
the volume of cabling, the oversized

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,079
heavy bus bars and additional cooling

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,000
equipment requirements in the facility.

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
This is making many current facility

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,079
designs obsolete before they're even

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,720
being built. So the challenge is clear.

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,920
How do we deliver much higher power

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,280
quickly, compactly, and efficiently so

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,280
that AI can continue scaling.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
Ver provides a superconducting power

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,520
cable solution to meet this challenge. a

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,240
compact modular high-capacity design to

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,400
transfer power in and around the the AI

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,720
campus or the data center campus

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
directly into server racks.

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,520
Superconducting power cables replace

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,880
conventional power distribution options

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,560
carrying 10 times more power than copper

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,400
with near zero losses enabling densities

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
conventional conductors just can't

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,320
support.

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,960
Here you see the components of the VER

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,680
product including the superconnecting

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,000
cable assembly, cooling infrastructure,

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,920
controls, electrical protection and

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
cable terminations that interface with

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,719
standard equipment.

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,200
These components form an integrated but

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,520
flexible platform. For example, one

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,479
cooling system supports multiple cables

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,000
across the campus.

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
Various products can be applied

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
throughout the campus from the grid

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,560
interconnection to building to building

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,840
distribution across the campus and into

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,800
the white spaces feeding the IT racks.

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,360
Compared to conventional feeders, there

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
reduces congestion and footprint

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,040
resulting in denser layouts, simpler

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,239
construction, faster energization. By

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,480
shrinking the power delivery

60
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
infrastructure, VE frees up space for

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,519
compute and extends the campus facil

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,519
campus capacity.

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
Multiple real use case analyses have

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,760
been have demonstrated the advantages of

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,080
applying superconductivity across the

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
campuses. The value proposition

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,319
propositions of our technology are

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,640
highlighted here. Inside the buildings,

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,200
we enable smaller, lighter, power dense

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,840
distribution, reducing copper,

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,959
supporting higher density clusters and

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,120
future proof proofing facilities.

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,760
With the longer reach, lower voltage

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,560
drop and smaller footprint, clients can

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,959
reduce construction times and use their

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
sites more efficiently. We've seen

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,760
optimized layouts for higher capacity

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,040
within the same land area, creating

79
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,959
direct economic value.

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,159
To show what this looks like in

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,000
practice, we created the STAR demo. STAR

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,640
is an abbreviation for superconducting

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
technology for AI racks, demonstrating

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,640
safe, compact, multi-megawatt power

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,120
delivery inside the building.

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,000
What you're seeing here is a fully

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,319
integrated 3 megawatt superconducting

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,200
power delivery system.

89
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,840
We're delivering 3 megawatt through a

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,480
single low voltage cable in a simulated

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,439
data center environment using the same

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,360
architecture as a live facility. Every

93
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
component is engineered for real world

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
deployment.

95
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,480
This milestone shows that

96
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,760
superconductors can deliver

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,480
multimegawatt power with far less space

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,720
and heat. And this technology is ready

99
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,439
now. If you're stuck trying to get

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,759
megawatt power across your data center

101
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,000
campus and into the IT racks, I'd love

102
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:25,440
to connect with you. Thank you.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,199
>> Thank you Sasha so much. So um again a

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,040
reminder to pose your questions either

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,960
to the Q&A tab or the chat. Um let me

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,960
start with one. So what are the biggest

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
value drivers to leveraging

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,479
superconducting cables and why would you

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,720
say that? Um, superconductors deliver

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,720
five far higher power densities and a

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
much smaller footprint with almost no

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
electrical losses. And so that means

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
there are fewer conductors across the

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,080
campus. There's less heating, less

115
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,800
cooling, um, less less heating,

116
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,639
dramatically simplified installations.

117
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,280
So we've shown, for example, in some

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,759
installations that we can reduce the

119
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,280
construction by 40%, construction costs

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:11,840
by 40% and increase the time by 3 to 6

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,680
months. Um in some other cases also the

122
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,240
really the compactness if I had to pick

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,280
out one particular thing the compactness

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,840
of our solution and how that drives

125
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,240
value is um evidence in some of the

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,479
other use cases that we've seen in a 200

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,880
megawatt facility we were able to

128
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,240
increase the IT capacity inside of the

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,440
building by 12 megaww which resulted in

130
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,680
a revenue generation of 100 million. So

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,639
that was a very clear economic driver

132
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,080
due to the compact um footprints of our

133
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,400
cables.

134
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,919
>> Yes, good comparisons and good benefits.

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,520
Um and also what is your go to market

136
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,520
strategy at the moment?

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
>> So we're doing a few things. Um we're

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,639
partnering um across the board with uh

139
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,680
with many many people in stakeholders in

140
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,360
the data center industry. Um we're

141
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,240
working with them to develop early

142
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,319
partnerships. So as I showed the road

143
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,479
map for Nvidia, we're closely aligned

144
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,479
with that road map. So we're really

145
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,919
trying to be wrapped and not wrapped,

146
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,759
sorry, we're really trying to engage

147
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:19,600
early so that we can be ready for the

148
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,440
2029 deployment of mega megawws. Uh and

149
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
we want to do that even earlier. We're

150
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,039
speeding that up. So we want to actually

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,600
be ready in 2028, 27,28.

152
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,440
>> Okay. And uh one more question. Um is

153
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
the entire cable and cooling system

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,600
self-contained or what else of an

155
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,560
infrastructure is needed?

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,639
>> Yeah, so the entire uh the cable is

157
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,440
actually cooled using a cryogen liquid

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,840
nitrogen and so that liquid nitrogen um

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,039
is modular. It's a infrastructure that

160
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,639
it can be on a skid and we can multiply

161
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,600
that as needed for the cooling

162
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,120
requirements across the campus.

163
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,919
>> Okay, thanks so much Sasha.

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,919
>> Thank you.
