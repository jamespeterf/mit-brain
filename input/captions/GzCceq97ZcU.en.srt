14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,559
>> Okay. So, today uh we have a guest

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
lecture. Some of whom are pro some of

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,440
you are probably already taking her

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,920
class. Uh

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
>> my victims, current victims

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
>> and past victims.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,320
>> Past victims. Um, I probably need to do

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,640
something for the light.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,640
I think it's

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,079
>> I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I I'm still

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,640
operating on Tylenol and Cathy. Um, so

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
uh you know to uh today we're going to

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
talk about stories and games and Clara

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,640
teaches uh not just the intro to video

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
game studies class but also the writing

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,880
for video games class in the spring. uh

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,119
I kind of uh wanted her to come in and

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,560
bring her expertise uh because she's

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,520
carefully looked at this problem a lot

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,280
more than I have and uh and yeah

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,080
everybody

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,240
I've seen you know um so yeah Phil asked

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,119
me to come here and talk about uh

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,720
stories and games and I as far as I

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,320
remember you guys had to read two

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,400
articles for today chapter four of yes

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,600
real and Seren Johnson's um things not

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,439
meeting which was what I take this

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,680
course to

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,399
>> yes but he's late okay

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
anyway so so this has been preparing

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,840
this has been kind of interesting

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
because yeah there's there's I think

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
I've thought about this you know quite a

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,719
bit because you know is this some part

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,959
of the focus of my research studying how

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,399
you know games and stories can be

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
brought together what Does it mean to

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,280
have a story in the game? Uh where do we

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
put the story? Uh but the interesting

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,560
challenge was thinking well the guys are

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,400
working mostly on non-digital games and

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,560
what does it have to do what do stories

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
have to do with with non-digital games.

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,280
So here what I'm going to need is your

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,440
input because you guys have been playing

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
all these board games, card games. uh

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,599
and I want a bit of your input on what

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,040
you think um you know the how you think

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,200
these concepts uh apply to um to

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,239
non-digital games and uh because the

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,000
part of digital games I I can do pretty

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
confidently but I don't know as much

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,920
about board games or card games so I

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
need your expertise this is what you

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,800
guys are doing uh so the first thing

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,360
that I wanted to ask you about you the

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
we had two different readings one is

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,080
talking about fiction and the other is

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,400
talking about theme But what is the

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,400
fiction of a game according to you?

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,879
>> The fiction of a game is well whatever

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
you want. It could be the characters in

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,640
the game. Let's digital game. It could

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,080
be a real environment. You just have

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,800
fictional characters. It could be um an

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,319
environment that may not exist. It's

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,920
pretty much it's up to designer to

82
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,159
figure out what they want to like be in

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,239
the game that aren't real and what they

84
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,319
want it to be

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,159
uh fiction.

86
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,840
>> Well, it's

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,159
there's something there, but but it

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,120
might be a bit more

89
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,480
if I it might be a bit more intuitive

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
than that. I mean, yeah, I think that

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,519
you're on the right track. Yes.

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,159
>> I'd say it's the setting or the universe

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,920
in which the user perceives the events

94
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,920
of the game to take place in. or the one

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,799
that the designer intends the user to

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
see the game take place.

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,879
>> Okay. So, I mean, you've mentioned

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,439
environment is kind of like the the the

99
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,120
what was the word you the universe, you

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,959
know, the setting, you know, something

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
like that back then.

102
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,319
>> Oh, yeah. I think the word you used over

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
and over was world. It's just a world

104
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,040
>> pretty much

105
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
>> and that's the key word. you know when

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,280
we when when um Gary was talking about

107
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,720
fiction he's really talking all

108
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,800
throughout about fictional worlds uh and

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
in a way you know designing games and

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,880
designing video games specifically is

111
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,560
always

112
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,840
thinking about what is the world of this

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
game and at times there might be games

114
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,560
that don't have worlds you know you can

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,560
make Tetris you can make there's very

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,120
few video games without worlds but there

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,360
are some tetra is u

118
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
>> peg Well, Pegle has characters, you

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
know, you were talking about this like

120
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
characters are already flying a fiction.

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Um,

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,960
>> please he says like has nothing to do

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,639
with unicorns.

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,639
>> Yes,

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
>> you want to say something. Oh, we have

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,320
two hands here.

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,840
>> Stealing it. Okay. Um, and particularly

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,680
with board games, I think of fiction

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,280
much more as the the specific explicit

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,440
things they give you. Mhm.

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,080
>> Um like the pictures, the the rules and

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,759
all of that stuff versus like what it

133
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,360
>> what it feels like you're doing. So if

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
they don't specifically tell you you're

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
in blah place, then that's not part of a

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,560
fiction.

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
>> Okay. Yeah. So that's you put your

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,919
finger on it that when we're talking

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,360
about non-digital games, there are some

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,600
non-digital games where thinking about

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,400
worlds is a bit shaky. Do you want to

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,840
say something?

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
>> Uh yeah, I was going to add that in an

144
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,520
environment, you have a set of things

145
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,039
you can do. So, you're basically given

146
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
rules. Like in a board game, you could

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,560
be you could be given uh if a character

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,000
has to jump for some reason, then you uh

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,320
the board game could say that they could

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
jump some insane distance while in real

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,199
life they can't do that. That's just

152
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
part of the fiction. So, it's whatever

153
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,840
laws apply to within that world as well.

154
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,680
So there are this is a very interesting

155
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,759
point because when when you was talking

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,039
about um what's the word he uses in

157
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,560
congruous worlds incoherent incoherent

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,919
he talks about incoherent worlds and

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
it's like going in coherent according to

160
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,720
what you know at times you know the

161
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
rules are also creating part of the

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,400
fiction the rules are also creating that

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,160
you know what are um the the gravity the

164
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,039
laws of gravity in the specific world

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,639
that we're playing in for example um so

166
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,120
so you know we when we're talking about

167
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,120
fiction we're mainly talking about

168
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,240
fictional world, but how does that

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,000
relate to theme? And you were already

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
kind of hinting at at that, you know,

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
that that in fiction and board games,

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,600
it's kind of like, well, it almost can

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
be about anything. But what is the theme

174
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,240
of when you, if you remember, sorry

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,479
Johnson's discussion, what does he refer

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
to as a theme? He is not an academic, so

177
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,840
he has a more

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,160
>> wobbly loose definition. It was a theme

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,160
of a game.

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,160
The theme of the game is what the

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,800
designer says to the player. This is

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,800
what the game is about.

183
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,800
But when Son Johnson is saying theme is

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,800
not meaning.

185
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,360
So he's making a point that theme is

186
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,759
might not be what the game is about.

187
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
>> Right.

188
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,680
>> It's just what the game designer tells

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,759
you.

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,759
>> Yeah. I mean this this is what the

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
example that that he gives is ticket to

192
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,360
ride right

193
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,319
>> and ticket to ride is not about riding

194
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,360
trains is about

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,240
>> it's about well

196
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,360
the description is about going from one

197
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
end to another right

198
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,120
>> it's building

199
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
>> it's about traveling across the United

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
States

201
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
>> but is it really traveling or is it

202
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,039
building the

203
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,560
>> story about traveling

204
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,479
>> yeah the story It's about traveling.

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
That's the theme. But the you know what

206
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,520
you actually do is

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,160
>> the official the official story is that

208
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
>> um I think it's some number of years

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
after the events of around the world in

210
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,080
80 days

211
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,759
>> and to commemorate that the original

212
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,879
people who were involved in that race

213
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
decided that they're going to race

214
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,800
across America in trains

215
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
>> and that is the theme of the game

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,879
according to

217
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,400
>> that's the theme of the game Alec.

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,160
>> Well that's that's sort of like drives

219
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,160
to the point of what Senson is talking

220
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,400
about that when theme and meaning are in

221
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,400
congruous as they are in Ticket to Ride

222
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
to like an extreme extent. It can

223
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
actually turn people off from the game

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,879
sometimes. So,

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
>> well, and it's not War.

226
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,599
>> Well, not necessarily. I mean,

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,639
>> on Halo Wars a bit, it sound like you

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,159
bought it thinking it was going to be an

229
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
action game and got disappointed. It was

230
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,120
like

231
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,120
>> I mean, in the case of Chica to ride, it

232
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,360
is pretty much what we were just saying

233
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,839
there, right? that the theme seems to

234
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,720
just be what whoever it is that wrote

235
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,839
the instruction booklet says that

236
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,360
>> you're doing

237
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,880
>> which may not necessarily have anything

238
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
to do with the actual mechanics of the

239
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
game.

240
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,399
>> Yeah, I have a game. I don't know if you

241
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
guys have played it. And if you want to

242
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,680
play it, I can bring it back.

243
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,720
>> Uh is a Reneia game called Too Many

244
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,480
Cooks.

245
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
>> And it seems to be about cooking, but

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
you know,

247
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,399
yeah, you have ingredients and you're

248
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,120
supposed to have like a you're making a

249
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,040
soup of sorts, but really what you're

250
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,720
doing is resource management, you know,

251
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,959
and exchanging. Like just imagine being

252
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,360
a cook and having like, well, I have to

253
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,120
wait until I get the right ingredient or

254
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,320
like exchange it for another. It's like

255
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,600
that's not how you cook really. Um, so

256
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,560
there is, you know, there's always the

257
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,120
clash of of how how the fiction of the

258
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
game relates to the rules and and what

259
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
the interesting distinction between

260
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,399
fiction and theme is that theme seems to

261
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,200
be like a layer, seems to be like a a

262
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,519
decoration. Um, at times, you know, it

263
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,519
can be part of of the title. It can be,

264
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
you know, how the the tokens look like

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,080
or what the board looks like. That is

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,600
setting up the fiction uh of the game.

267
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,279
But it's um not the fiction, the theme,

268
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
you know, but it doesn't really have a

269
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,480
fictional world. Like when you're

270
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
playing Ticket to Ride or when you

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,920
playing Settlers is like, do you have

272
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,920
the feeling that you're in a world

273
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,600
more so than ticket to

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,519
>> I mean, so the the I will argue that

275
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,560
maybe the world that you feel is not the

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,800
world that they're telling you that

277
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,560
you're in, right? when one of the

278
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
problems of Ticket to Ride is that you

279
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
never really feel these characters

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
exist.

281
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,200
>> Yeah.

282
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,360
>> Um but the world of the United States is

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,120
very very present.

284
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,959
>> It's like you know the the the

285
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,519
positioning of the cities. The fact that

286
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,360
these cities exist and can be connected

287
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
>> by man is is very

288
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,720
>> you guys have read the levels of

289
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,320
abstraction talked about levels of

290
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
abstraction here at all.

291
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
>> Not in great detail what I'm talking

292
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,000
about. So the idea that you know it

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,680
might be a it's a world but it's so the

294
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
way that it works is so abstracted that

295
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,279
it doesn't really feel like a world

296
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
anymore. It's kind of like this little

297
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,160
bits and pieces.

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,160
>> Um so okay we have we have fiction and

299
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,079
we have you know theme but we also have

300
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,399
stories. And what do stories have to do

301
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,519
with this? You know how do how do we

302
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,839
have the story in non-digital games? No.

303
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,200
Well first of all you know a story and

304
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,640
I'm going to define it to you to save

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,720
time. Uh a story is uh a series of

306
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,279
events connected events that involve

307
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,920
characters. Uh so those characters

308
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,320
perform actions or there are happenings

309
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,040
things that happen to them and those

310
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,920
those actions happen in time and in a

311
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,560
specific setting uh in a in a specific

312
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,240
place. Uh and in the case of games they

313
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,440
also involve objects. That's kind of

314
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,920
like my telegraphic you know um version

315
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,880
of where the story is. So what we do in

316
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,519
games in games we have uh changed of

317
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,480
state right every step of a non-digital

318
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
game particularly we can think about uh

319
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,839
non-digital games as changes of state

320
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,959
and having a change of state can

321
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,760
constitute an event uh so that is one

322
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,440
way how do we generate rules that

323
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,480
generate changes of state that can be

324
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,839
thought of as um as an event in the

325
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,320
story but I want to know a bit more of

326
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,760
the games that you've played so far. How

327
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,720
can non-digital games um I don't know

328
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,639
what maybe you've played more than card

329
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,639
games than anything, but how can we have

330
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
a story? How can we have those events

331
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
happen?

332
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,399
>> So, one of the games that we played that

333
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,279
has a really nice story to it is Balar

334
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,079
Galactica.

335
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,000
>> And the way that works is uh it works

336
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
off of what the player already knows.

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,720
>> So, it sort of assumes that the player

338
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,800
has like the knowledge of Balar Galact.

339
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,880
And so, it keeps referring to that

340
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,920
whenever you play a that has special

341
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,959
abilities,

342
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,760
>> whatnot. So, it relies on previous

343
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,040
knowledge of play.

344
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,519
>> That's a very good point. I mean, part

345
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,600
of what we do and and it's in in digital

346
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,440
games and non-digital games, but it's

347
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
also in digital games. A lot of

348
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,120
storytelling in games happens in the

349
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,120
player's head is is evoking, you know,

350
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
certain characters, certain situations

351
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,399
is with tapping on the player's

352
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
knowledge. Is not, as we're going to

353
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,959
see, it's not so much about

354
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,279
storytelling, but we're kind of like,

355
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,519
okay, what do you know? we we are making

356
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,839
the player fill in the gaps. So that

357
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,480
designing a game that involves

358
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,560
storytelling is usually giving cues to

359
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,680
the player to create the story if that

360
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
makes sense.

361
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
>> Um Patrick

362
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,720
>> um I was going to say that uh a lot of

363
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,160
um like board card games all a lot of

364
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,160
the fiction just comes from the

365
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,560
metaphors of the mechanics.

366
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,160
>> So for example in a like settlers when

367
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,079
you want to build a road if you strip

368
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,839
away all the fiction it's just I have

369
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,200
these cards I put them down. I can put

370
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,079
this piece here.

371
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,120
>> But um adding the fiction to it, you say

372
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,399
now putting I'm not just putting cards

373
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,440
down. I'm uh using up resources to build

374
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,079
a road. And so that metaphorical action

375
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,839
is another like event in the story.

376
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,360
>> Well, it becomes a meaningful action. I

377
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,480
mean that's another I'm sure that you

378
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
guys have been talking about that you

379
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,600
know what is a meaningful action and at

380
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,040
times meaningful action is it

381
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,839
constitutes like a story event of sorts.

382
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,600
journey.

383
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,079
>> Um, I think that the whole point of

384
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,000
Munchkin and ShaGeek and those games uh

385
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,839
are to construct stories. We

386
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,399
>> when we played it, there was a moment

387
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,680
when someone trashed someone else's

388
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,240
shrooms and then the other person played

389
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,800
a go dumpster diving card to go pick up

390
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
the the shrooms and a bong from the

391
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,480
dumpster.

392
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,079
>> And this whole sequence of events, you

393
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,279
know, the flavor text on the cards, what

394
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,399
they were the actions you were taking,

395
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
and you put them all, you string them

396
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,199
all together. I did this then this

397
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,040
happened and this happened with these

398
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,320
objects and you've got a perfect story

399
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,760
because you know you're playing a geek

400
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,959
and uh you know

401
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
>> well there's that but the other thing

402
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,120
that is good about munch game is that

403
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,720
reading the cards is fun you know there

404
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,399
are bits of the story already in Munch

405
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,079
game like reading the events that is

406
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,959
kind of like engaging already you want

407
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,399
to say something

408
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,760
>> I was just going to say there are some

409
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,440
games which are like entirely about

410
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,839
telling stories

411
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,360
>> role playing games are the number one

412
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,279
and then another example is something

413
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,160
like once upon a time

414
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,160
>> which I think

415
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,920
And then there also the adventures of

416
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,600
bearing wood trousers if you've ever

417
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,279
>> Yes. Oh, I should bring it. Yes, I have

418
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
it in my office, but that's kind of

419
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,000
difficult to set up like in half an

420
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,720
hour. Yeah,

421
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,720
>> I'm actually a friend of mine invented a

422
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,000
game which is kind of vaguely based on

423
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,000
the adventures of Barry Mchowen um where

424
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
you each person is telling a story and

425
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,760
they have cards in front of them which

426
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
need to be flipped over and by

427
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,519
incorporating the elements of the story

428
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,480
that cards

429
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,480
anyway don't worry about

430
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,639
>> yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah no

431
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,279
yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah no yeah no

432
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,279
no I'm going no yeah you you we're going

433
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,279
a bit faster but that's fine because you

434
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,440
know yeah there are games that are about

435
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,880
storytelling communal storytelling and

436
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
role playing games are about that you

437
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,800
know we again as as game designers what

438
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,519
we are given when we have the rule book

439
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,480
from D and D are is a fictional world

440
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,240
that has rules and but then we have as

441
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,680
as a as a designer as a DM uh we are

442
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
coming up with what is the situation

443
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,560
what is the world what is the specific

444
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,519
challenges that we're situating in this

445
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,920
world how are we going to do that uh but

446
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,680
is is about communal sorting as as as

447
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,519
we're going to see in a minute there are

448
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,240
also games that are about coming up with

449
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,399
stories like we're being thrown you know

450
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,759
the similar way. Well, in Munchkin,

451
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,920
you're kind of like constructing the

452
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,519
story as you go. But in the games that

453
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,680
we're going to play today, or some of

454
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,800
you are like gloom or once upon a time

455
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,040
is the game is being able to produce a

456
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,800
narrative, being able to make sense

457
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,000
given the specific cues you would have

458
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,440
had your hand.

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,079
>> So, I was going to do the opposite

460
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,959
extreme of a game with a very basic

461
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,399
story and you kind of make the story a

462
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,360
little as you go along, but it's not

463
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,839
really that crazy. uh game card game

464
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,079
falling where pretty much the pretense

465
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,839
says you are goblins. Everyone's a

466
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,880
goblin and you're falling to your

467
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,079
demise. And so the point so while you

468
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,759
guys are falling you guys decide we who

469
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,079
let's make a contest of who hits the

470
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,320
ground last. And so it's a real time

471
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,600
game and you're deal cards in order and

472
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,959
you keep going until you reach ground

473
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,720
cards. And so you can uh attack other

474
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,399
people. It's like okay this is going to

475
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,600
happen to you and different effects

476
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
happen. And so when you're actually

477
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
playing it, it's kind of like the

478
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,559
intensity when you're falling. It's

479
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,799
like, oh, I'm going to die. I have to do

480
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,919
this fast because before you know it,

481
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,760
ground star.

482
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
>> It's interesting because it creates a

483
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,679
longer event or something that is

484
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,400
supposed to be got like smashed, right?

485
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,559
Uh but it's kind of zooming in and how

486
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,799
long that would feel if you were

487
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,600
actually flying. uh make it like a mini

488
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,720
story of that or you know I it's

489
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,000
interesting because I don't know how

490
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,679
strong and this is one of the questions

491
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,679
when we're talking about stories and

492
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,840
games is you know what kind of event

493
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,600
constitutes an event in the story know

494
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,080
like is opening a door an event in the

495
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,799
story well in some games it can be

496
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,280
because it might give you access to uh

497
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,760
new areas you know there might be

498
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,600
someone showing up that changes things

499
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,720
uh but in other cases you know like I

500
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:55,120
don't know in Monopoly getting to um uh

501
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,280
going around and getting the how many

502
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,720
$100 $200 you know is that an event you

503
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,000
know

504
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,160
>> maybe it's not it doesn't seem like a

505
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,760
story event because it's such a mundane

506
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,280
thing that happens all the time although

507
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,120
clearly has given

508
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,160
>> yeah it does have an effect but as a

509
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,960
storytelling you know part is kind of

510
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,120
questionable um the other thing I wanted

511
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,000
to ask you know since you guys have been

512
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,520
playing um particularly board games you

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
know there are board games that have

514
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,840
similar mechanics. So, I've played Race

515
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,080
of the Galaxy, which I really like, and

516
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,120
I've been told that Puerto Rico is very

517
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,039
similar.

518
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,000
>> Yes. So, does changing the theme I mean

519
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,080
that those games have different themes,

520
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,640
but is does changing the theme affect

521
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,240
the rules in any ways for those of you

522
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,160
who might have played both?

523
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,720
>> Not really. I mean, not Puerto Rico, but

524
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,960
San Juan, I think, is closer. San is

525
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
with the cards, but uh it doesn't really

526
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,840
change the game because the mechanics

527
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,320
are almost identical. It's just kind of

528
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,679
covered in a different shell of whatever

529
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,280
it is, whatever the mechanic they're

530
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,039
trying to mimic.

531
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,160
>> So, it's kind of like maybe if you don't

532
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,919
like colonial or, you know, whatever.

533
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
>> Yeah. If you don't like if you don't

534
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
like the the

535
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,080
>> science fiction part of

536
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,200
>> the science fiction theme, you could go

537
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,600
for this more earth town building theme.

538
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,760
>> Yeah.

539
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,880
>> But if you don't like playing the game

540
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,240
itself,

541
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
>> switching to the other game is probably

542
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,440
not going to be all.

543
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,880
>> Yes. Yeah. which I think is kind of

544
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,480
interesting and just kind of like okay

545
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,080
so tug of munch doesn't kind of cancel

546
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,720
>> the interesting thing is that in neither

547
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,000
of those cases unlike say ticket to

548
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,679
right these things like feel like

549
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,760
they're attacked on theme and in each

550
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,280
case the actual mechanics of the card

551
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,520
faithfully represent what they're

552
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,080
supposed to be in in the in the game

553
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,280
fiction right so

554
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,559
>> I feel that this the fact that they the

555
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
themes are essentially kind of

556
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,840
interchangeable or like the the same

557
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,280
mechanics underly both games despite the

558
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,799
fact that they have different themes

559
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,960
doesn't necessarily mean that there's

560
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,320
some something wrong with the theming.

561
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,840
It's just that

562
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,919
>> but the meaning is similar

563
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
>> mechanics are flexib

564
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,280
what you actually do in the games is

565
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,160
similar you know resource management

566
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,280
planning ahead knowing where you can

567
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,720
deploy a certain you know they are about

568
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,679
the same thing even if they have

569
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,200
different settings uh so that's probably

570
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
the connection it's not about oh if you

571
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,960
like science fiction games you can play

572
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,240
the battlest star galactica game and

573
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,400
race to the galaxy whereas I'm guessing

574
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,799
that for most people it's like well if I

575
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,559
like Puerto Rico or Puerto Rico San

576
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,400
Juan. Sorry, I wrong place

577
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,240
>> name. The games are close enough that

578
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
>> but but you would play something that is

579
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,880
similar. Does that make sense?

580
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,720
>> If if the meaning of both games is

581
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,400
really

582
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,760
empire building in some sense, right?

583
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,280
You know, in some kind of historical in

584
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,840
futuristic, but they're both empire

585
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,520
building. That's why I mean sure the

586
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,200
theme is very well applied in both of

587
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,679
these games but it will also make sense

588
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,679
that that will make sense because both

589
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,880
themes are about empire building only

590
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,559
you know one to the future and one to

591
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,280
the past.

592
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,799
>> Okay. So you know we have this is taking

593
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,200
a bit of time but these are like the

594
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,120
foundations of the of the concepts that

595
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,000
I wanted to get across today and discuss

596
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,159
today. Uh when we talk about video

597
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,480
games, there's another there's an extra

598
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,600
layer which is you know video games that

599
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,880
are story driven versus just games with

600
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,919
a story. Uh and the example I have here

601
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,919
is uh so this is selfcal 2 as far as I

602
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,919
remember

603
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,159
>> I think I don't know I I looked for cell

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,480
caliber one that was familiar um the

605
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,360
characters I knew anyway. So, in

606
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Soulcalibur, we have what's a game

607
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
about?

608
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,120
>> Fighting.

609
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,320
>> It's about fighting and kicking ass, you

610
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,280
know.

611
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,280
>> Story that doesn't

612
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,799
>> And it does have a weird story that is

613
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
kind of like, well, does anybody know

614
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,420
the story? I know that there's

615
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,640
something. And there's some reason why

616
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:07,120
[Music]

617
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,120
>> Sophia Sophia, right?

618
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,640
>> I didn't know. I think this is

619
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,039
>> they're like related somehow. They're

620
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,559
like mother and daughter

621
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,559
sisters or something.

622
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,280
>> Oh, okay. That's maybe that's why she's

623
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,280
asking for forgiveness. I don't know. Do

624
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,600
I care? I still like these games, but do

625
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,559
I know the stories? No. Do I Does it

626
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,840
matter? Not really. I mean, not for

627
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,600
these. I mean, for some people, I'm sure

628
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,200
that they do care about the stories of

629
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,360
these or the stories of the characters

630
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,360
in Street Fighter, for example. Yes.

631
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,960
Well, I was gonna say like for games

632
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,559
like this, I actually kind of like the

633
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,960
story because it adds

634
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,200
>> like it the game is not the story. There

635
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,360
are two separate entities,

636
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
>> but one kind of like add to the other

637
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,960
for me. Like Diablo, for example,

638
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,799
>> um there's lots of people that have

639
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,480
played Diablo II without really caring

640
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,480
about, you know, like the actual story.

641
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,600
>> The cinematics were so cool back in the

642
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,360
day.

643
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,679
>> True. But the thing

644
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,360
>> but but like even though like you can

645
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,039
you can pretty much separate the story

646
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,360
from Diablo II and people would still

647
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,559
probably play it like the story

648
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,520
definitely adds a layer of like I I am

649
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,159
attached to this game.

650
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,159
>> But Diablo I mean in Diablo is the the

651
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,000
difference is is that Diablo is closer

652
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
to being a storydriven game. It's closer

653
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,720
to being like an RPG game where you know

654
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,840
the quests you have to know you know who

655
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,720
you're going to talk to what you're

656
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,760
going to do. Um, I had a friend, we

657
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,000
were, you know, uh, working in in this

658
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,200
game service and we had to test all

659
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,039
these, um, role playing games and one of

660
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
my co-workers was like, oh, I have to

661
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,960
play it was Balders's Gate, too. Like

662
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,480
one of the cool ones. And he was like,

663
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,080
"Okay, I have to test this and I just

664
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,919
have to see that it works." And he was

665
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,880
not paying attention to any other texts.

666
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,559
He was just doing the technical testing,

667
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,480
but then he got stuck. I mean, we were

668
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,240
supposed to finish the the games and he

669
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
was stuck and he was going slower

670
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,520
because he didn't know what to do. It's

671
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,679
like, well, if he had read what you

672
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,880
actually had to do, but for him it's

673
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,640
like, well, it's just a story. It's

674
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,840
like, well, you're playing an RPG. You

675
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,679
kind of really leave the the story out.

676
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,760
If somebody's telling you that you have

677
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,039
to, you know, squash, I don't know how

678
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,400
many orcs, you know, you have to know

679
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,880
that you have to squash the orcs. You

680
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,720
can, you have to know where to go. Um,

681
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,279
so, so in storydriven games, what

682
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,039
happens is that the story is really so

683
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,360
tied to the rules and the goals of the

684
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,840
game that you have as you advance in the

685
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,320
game, you're also advancing in the

686
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,120
story. That's something that, you know,

687
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,559
here when when you um, you know, you

688
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,400
beat up somebody in Soulcalibur or or uh

689
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,600
or Street Fighter, whatever fighting

690
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,200
game you can think of, you know, there

691
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,440
might be a little uh uh cutscene uh that

692
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,679
tells us who they are. One thing that I

693
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
like about is it Soulcalibur? Yeah. Like

694
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,279
there's a bit of taunting like ah you

695
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,520
kind of beat me or something like that.

696
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,840
Um but that you know is is building

697
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,080
character a bit and that needs writing

698
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,159
but really you know is is not really

699
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,799
story driven. The fact that we're

700
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,799
getting big services as we complete

701
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,480
challenges you know it doesn't mean that

702
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,600
if we ignore the game we can still

703
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,600
complete the game without knowing the

704
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,360
story. Does it make sense? So there's,

705
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,840
you know, this is this is something that

706
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,400
video games are doing that to a certain

707
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,159
extent some of the board games that you

708
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,080
might have been playing don't quite do.

709
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,799
Does it make does make sense that it's

710
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,720
kind of like we can still think of and

711
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,200
and there might be you know some people

712
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
who play these board games still at a

713
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,279
mathematical level without paying any

714
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,000
attention to what the events that's

715
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,520
representing are. Uh but that's one

716
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,279
potential of video games. you know that

717
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,279
idea of having a storydriven game where

718
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,600
you are playing a game you are

719
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,679
interacting with the world with a strong

720
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,760
and in the cases of storydriven games

721
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,679
you also have a strong little fictional

722
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,200
world that you're interacting with that

723
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,039
you are exploring that you're poking

724
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,440
around um so one thing that I wanted to

725
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,360
make clear here is that you know when we

726
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,080
talk when we talk about storytelling and

727
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,760
I always try to use it the term we're

728
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,440
talking about stories but is it really

729
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,279
storytelling and the thing is that

730
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,960
technically games don't tell stories.

731
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,880
You know, who's telling the story? Who's

732
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,720
the narrator? You know, there might be

733
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
games that have the kind of gimmick of

734
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,200
having a narrator like um Prince of

735
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,960
Persia Sands of Time. You know, when you

736
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,400
make a mistake and you know, he's

737
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,000
supposed to be telling what's happened

738
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,480
to him and it's like, "No, no, no,

739
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,520
wait." You know, I No, no, no. That's

740
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,679
not how it happened. Um but really in

741
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,159
most games you know things again like

742
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,120
Balders's Gate or Diablo or more

743
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,679
recently like you know uh Mass Effect

744
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,720
you know it's like what you know who is

745
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,480
the storyteller you know and and the the

746
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
thing is that there are also different

747
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,080
types of stories you know when we are

748
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,880
interacting with the game what we're

749
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,200
doing is is performing and as we perform

750
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,520
we're creating a story there's a story

751
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,919
that has been maybe prepared for us you

752
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,919
know kind of going back to the munchkin

753
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,120
thing, you know, in every card we have a

754
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,159
bit of the story and um and we are kind

755
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,520
of like we are putting it together like

756
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,679
laying it out. Um so so the game

757
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,200
designers have designed each game you

758
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,799
know each chunk of the story what are

759
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,960
the cues that we're giving the player

760
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,080
but then there's also what us as player

761
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,760
are are bringing to the to the game you

762
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,679
know as I was saying before you know

763
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,000
there's part that is the game itself

764
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,159
telling its story and the other is what

765
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,200
we're invoking what we are having the

766
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,880
player uh bring uh to the game you know

767
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,880
is the story happening in the player's

768
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,880
head so what I like to say is that it's

769
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,360
not really storytelling it's about story

770
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,000
building and as game designers we are

771
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,520
designing those little chunks you know

772
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,200
or we are uh creating stories that are

773
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,480
uh that are meant to be reconstructed

774
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,919
that are meant to be together. Uh so the

775
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,600
difference between storytelling and

776
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,440
story building you know basically when

777
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,080
we have storytelling we have somebody

778
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,799
who's narrating or uh you know maybe

779
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,960
there's some uh uh someone who's

780
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,880
enacting what's happened. of things like

781
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,200
theater for example but it's continuous

782
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,600
it's something that just happens and you

783
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,000
know is not is not fragmented which is

784
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,559
what what story building needs you know

785
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,399
we have something that is as has already

786
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,399
happened you know is communicated one

787
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,240
way uh and how what those events are and

788
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,559
what order they're told that's

789
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,360
determined by the author. If we think

790
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,360
about stories and how stories apply to

791
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,120
games in terms of story building, we're

792
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,799
talking about fragmented stories. You

793
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,880
know, stories in pieces, stories that we

794
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,880
have to put together like a puzzle. And

795
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,880
you know, we're game designers. We make

796
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,600
puzzles. That's one of the many things

797
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,360
that we can do. Uh what those fragments

798
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,440
are, how we were giving cues to the

799
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,600
player to put together those fragments

800
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,240
or to come up with their own ways of of

801
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,240
coming up with the story. Um, in a way

802
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,320
it's a kind of collaboration between the

803
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,320
the designer and the player because we

804
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,399
rely on the player to put this story

805
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,919
together to come up with their own ways

806
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,320
of filling the gaps um to to really have

807
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,799
a proactive role in figuring out what

808
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,039
the story is uh and what the order of

809
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,080
events is. I mean there are you guys

810
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,679
have seen the the games of progression

811
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,799
and games of emergence.

812
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,720
>> Yes.

813
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,320
>> Discuss that

814
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,919
first.

815
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,679
I'm trying to remember this.

816
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,000
>> It's like the very It's in the first

817
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,840
chapter.

818
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,360
>> I think we had actually did the the

819
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,679
initial paper.

820
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,919
>> Okay.

821
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,240
>> Yeah. Yeah. We we had in the paper not

822
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,799
not

823
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,760
>> another

824
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
basically the same.

825
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,480
>> Okay. Yeah. No, cuz he he talked about

826
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,840
the same thing totally different places.

827
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,760
Um so so yeah what what happens is that

828
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,080
you know at times there are games that

829
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,799
have a specific order of events and

830
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,200
there are certain adventure games like

831
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,240
uh Siberia for example where you have to

832
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,679
go through a very specific sequence of

833
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,559
events and when you get to a scene it's

834
00:29:51,679 --> 00:30:00,880
like you have to do this uh things like

835
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:03,120
um Dragon Slayer the the laser disc DVD

836
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,640
like when you go to a place and you have

837
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,000
to figure out what is the action that

838
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,919
you have to do and if you don't do it

839
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,120
you're you know you die in horrible

840
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:15,279
ways. Um so those are you know those are

841
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,760
games that set the order of events very

842
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,080
very specifically but most of the games

843
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,320
tend to have some more flexibility. You

844
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,760
know let the player explore the world.

845
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,880
You know the things that happen in the

846
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,279
world are generated by how the player is

847
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,200
interacting with the world. So in RPGs

848
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,520
for example, depending on the RPG, there

849
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,840
might be the main quests and the side

850
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,399
quests and there might be flexibility in

851
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,520
what order that happens or even how a

852
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,880
player might solve a a specific quest in

853
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,640
top tabletop. I don't know who here is

854
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,240
has been uh dungeon master. Okay, a

855
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,159
bunch of you.

856
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,080
>> So everybody,

857
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,480
>> okay, so we have the corner of the

858
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,640
dungeon masters. So, you probably know

859
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,159
that when you design a quest, you know,

860
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,240
and then you you set it up and you have

861
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,600
your players and then your players come

862
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,600
up with totally different ways of

863
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,360
tackling your quest you had never come

864
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,960
up with and you have to improvise and

865
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,720
trying to, you know, like you're

866
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,159
building the rails as they're moving.

867
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,760
You know, it's kind of like, you know,

868
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,600
trying to anticipate what they're going

869
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,919
to do. Um, so so that's we're trying to

870
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,919
get that into video games, too, but but

871
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,640
we don't have the improvisational

872
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,720
capacity built in in computers yet. Uh

873
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,200
but but as you see it's kind of like we

874
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,600
the game or the dungeon master as

875
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,880
dungeon masters we're responding to the

876
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,520
actions of the player. Does it make

877
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,360
sense? And then there are you know we

878
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,039
where we're talking about story building

879
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,679
there are games as I was saying that are

880
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,919
about story building where the challenge

881
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,760
is constructing a story improvising as

882
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,000
you as you go. You know you're given

883
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,240
chunks and you have to be able to be a

884
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,240
storyteller. Uh but you'll play that

885
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,559
these later.

886
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,360
Um,

887
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,159
we've actually talked about this before.

888
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,360
So, when we're talking about building

889
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,519
the fictional world of of the game, you

890
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,320
know, I'm going I'm going to go through

891
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:13,120
through this a bit um fast. We have

892
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:15,279
until 4:30, right? Yes. Okay. Uh, so

893
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,440
there are also very minimal ways in

894
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,559
which we can, you know, construct our

895
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,279
fiction. uh and these are lessons that

896
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,919
I've taken from digital games but if you

897
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:30,080
think about it many of these also apply

898
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:33,600
to uh non-digital games uh so for

899
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,039
example we have um the title of a game

900
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,320
can tell us you know something about the

901
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,640
fictional world right so come what about

902
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,600
uh board games or card games how do the

903
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,360
titles build the fictional world

904
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,480
>> the board game Mafia Wars is pretty

905
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,399
clear about with that

906
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
>> there you go so that's a way It's

907
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,200
evoking certain things like the title

908
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,039
can evoke a world on itself and also

909
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,919
certain situations. So we hear mafia

910
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,919
wars is about

911
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,039
>> there's different factions.

912
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,519
>> There's going

913
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,039
>> there's going to be betrayal probably,

914
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,720
you know, shooting down people in

915
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,360
horrible ways.

916
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,000
>> Pretty much any licensed game.

917
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,640
>> Any licensed game. Yes. There were types

918
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,519
of you know things like versions of

919
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,320
Monopoly or true pursuit that it's kind

920
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,279
of like is that

921
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,360
>> Star Wars

922
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,880
>> Star Wars everything

923
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,960
>> risk it's a kind of broad

924
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,640
>> and there are also skinningings of risk

925
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,600
right

926
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
>> there like

927
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,440
>> Lord of the Rings

928
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,440
>> Lord of the Rings everything

929
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,440
>> I don't know

930
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,440
>> I've seen like so many this god which

931
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,360
takes place back in like it's like

932
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,760
mythological.

933
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,200
>> Yeah. What other apart from franchises,

934
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,960
what other title? Sorry.

935
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,919
>> The settlers of katan.

936
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,159
>> Settlers of katan which is evoking

937
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,200
>> settling

938
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,200
building cities

939
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,200
>> building.

940
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,760
>> Yeah. I mean it's kind of who you

941
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
talking to.

942
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,000
>> Chinatown.

943
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,919
>> Chinatown.

944
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,119
>> It's set from Chinatown.

945
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,879
>> And what do you do?

946
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,079
You build businesses that are

947
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,079
stereotypically associated with

948
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,240
>> one title. It's not only we're evoking a

949
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,240
world, but we can also invoke rules.

950
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,839
What do you have to do here? So if mafia

951
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,720
were to kill people, you know, don't

952
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:32,560
settle jobs and longer.

953
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,159
>> Uh but you're already implying what some

954
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,159
of the rules are, what the game is

955
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,079
about. Um which is what is important

956
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,399
here. And and again, you know, Seren

957
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,919
Johnson calls attention to the fact that

958
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,320
if you say if you're announcing that

959
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,399
your game is about something in this

960
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,399
trench booklet that people might not

961
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,000
always read or at least the part that

962
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,320
people don't read, you know, you should

963
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,079
you should um follow up on that because

964
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,960
it's kind of helping. He's giving cues

965
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,560
to the player about how is the story of

966
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,119
the game going to build up. you know

967
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,720
what is the cue you I like talking about

968
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,119
giving cues to the player a lot because

969
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,200
I come from theater and and is a is a

970
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,800
very intuitive way of understanding it's

971
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,040
not about us telling the story it's

972
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,920
about helping the player construct the

973
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,599
story so I have two examples from from

974
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,480
video games that I really like about how

975
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,280
to to build a fictional world with with

976
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,839
a title I mean one obvious one in in

977
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,480
video games is Space Invaders right

978
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:31,119
Space Invaders means we're on Earth

979
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,400
>> and they're invaders from space that we

980
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,000
probably have to fight.

981
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,320
>> Invading our space.

982
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,800
>> Another good one. Zombies ain't my

983
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,560
neighbors. There's a whole story right

984
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,359
there. So, what's the story of this

985
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,200
game?

986
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,720
>> Zombies a neighbor. So, what do I do in

987
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,520
this game?

988
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
>> Zombies.

989
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,320
>> So, probably killing zombies.

990
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,680
>> Zombies eating my neighbors. So, zombies

991
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
could have eaten my neighbors and then

992
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,000
just left.

993
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,520
>> Maybe the zombies are your neighbors.

994
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,800
>> Yeah. Oh, maybe you have to kill your

995
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
neighbors too now.

996
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,119
>> Um, if there's anything left because

997
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,000
they hit them. Um, but it's, you know,

998
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,280
like this is building like a whole, you

999
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,720
know, situation. What do I have to do?

1000
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,520
Okay, zombies, walking zombies, I'm

1001
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,800
sure. Or run away from the neighbors. I

1002
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,079
>> mean, the fact that you have neighbors

1003
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
implies that there's a neighborhood,

1004
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,400
right? It's not like a military zombie

1005
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,119
shooter.

1006
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,880
>> Yes.

1007
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,839
>> Yeah. It's not rested.

1008
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,920
>> It looks vaguely like 50s.

1009
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,960
>> Yeah. I'm not sure about that. I think

1010
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,280
this is like a Genesis game.

1011
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,320
I was just looking at the old like 50s.

1012
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,760
>> I mean, hearkening back to the movies of

1013
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,480
>> Yeah.

1014
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,960
>> Uh, another great title that I found not

1015
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:45,000
long ago, Earth Dies Screaming.

1016
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,000
>> Wow. which is actually

1017
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:52,400
>> is the title is from a 70s British movie

1018
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,560
uh that I think has nothing to do with

1019
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,640
the game. This is another it's like

1020
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,320
Space Invaders in a way. You are

1021
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,720
defending the Earth. It kind of like

1022
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,599
looks like that. Um you have your

1023
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,680
spaceship and you have a one of the

1024
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,119
invaders and you have to you just

1025
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,720
destroy it before it lands on Earth. Um,

1026
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,640
but again, you know, it kind of it's

1027
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,640
very evocative. I mean, it's kind of

1028
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,040
more memorable than Space Invaders in a

1029
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,359
way. Uh, because it's kind of like,

1030
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,760
okay, there's people attacking Earth,

1031
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,359
whoever it is, and this is going to end

1032
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,839
badly. That's another thing that Space

1033
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,280
Invaders are things like Miscommand and

1034
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,800
all those arcade games that didn't have

1035
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,880
an ending. You know, in this, you know,

1036
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,400
the ending, you know, you cannot really

1037
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,040
save Earth. It's really it's really uh

1038
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,560
ominous in a way. Uh but again like you

1039
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,880
have a whole world you have a whole

1040
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,480
situation is about in the title and it's

1041
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,880
also very memorable. I really like this

1042
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,079
title. Um, another way in which we can

1043
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,800
give cues to um to players to build

1044
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,960
worlds. And I had more of this, but but

1045
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,480
this applies more to um this applies

1046
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,320
more to video games than to board games,

1047
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,440
card games, you know, and even role

1048
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,400
playing games. uh is character design

1049
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,920
because when we are making and and you

1050
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,079
know tell me from your own experience

1051
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,920
but when you're making nondigital games

1052
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,800
and even when you're making when you're

1053
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,359
preparing your uh Dungeons and Dragons

1054
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,359
campaign you don't really come up with

1055
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,520
the characters the characters is

1056
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,119
something that the player brings for

1057
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,720
card games. If you have any examples

1058
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,280
that are counter examples for this

1059
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,960
please let me know. Um but character

1060
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,800
design is not something that you do so

1061
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,720
much in non digital games. If you do you

1062
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,040
have any examples of that?

1063
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
>> Do the NPCs

1064
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,200
>> design?

1065
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,040
>> Yeah, in a way. Yes.

1066
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
>> I was thinking

1067
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,760
Arkham Horror and other games where you

1068
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,520
kind of have a character role which is

1069
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,400
assigned to you and often they have a

1070
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,680
backstory in Arkham Horror bio on the

1071
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,480
back or what have you.

1072
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,280
>> Okay.

1073
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,119
>> Yeah. I was going to say like um the the

1074
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,640
game where you're trying to clue clue

1075
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,680
where you have like a you choose a

1076
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,920
character and they all have their

1077
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,320
swords. I'm sure it's similar. Mhm. The

1078
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,800
things like are you as a player are you

1079
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,400
really involved with those characters?

1080
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,320
>> Okay. So I can think of one game which

1081
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,599
is an example where you are and it's

1082
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,079
called Android.

1083
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,079
>> Mhm.

1084
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,839
>> This is an uh this game was released I

1085
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,520
think two years ago now. And part of the

1086
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,000
actually you should probably play it.

1087
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:29,599
Um, part of part of the point is that it

1088
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,599
was trying to include like elements of

1089
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,880
resolving characters personal stories

1090
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,680
through mechanics in the game.

1091
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,200
>> Oh, yeah.

1092
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,880
>> So, you're actually you're kind of

1093
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,240
you're kind of living you're kind of

1094
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,200
playing through this choose your own

1095
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,640
adventurish type scenario. Um, and the

1096
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,640
choices that you make throughout the

1097
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,920
game influence like what directions your

1098
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,320
character's personal story arc takes

1099
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
>> a very good game. But

1100
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,119
it's interesting.

1101
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,480
>> Yeah. So, so there are the what I'm

1102
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,880
trying to get at here is that, you know,

1103
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,480
at times the characters are and again,

1104
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,640
you know, evoking actions, evoking

1105
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,520
certain emotions to it. things of that

1106
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,520
detachment with with non-digital games

1107
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,119
with role playing games is different but

1108
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,920
again when you're building your own

1109
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,520
character in role playing you have an

1110
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,520
investment but you're making it yourself

1111
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm talking more on the point of view of

1112
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:22,880
the designer here

1113
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:25,040
>> so another I guess game game again

1114
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,440
Battlestar Galactica you are assigning a

1115
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,880
character and if you know that like if

1116
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,240
you know Battlestar Galactica you're

1117
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,160
probably going to go for certain

1118
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,560
characters cuz like I that character is

1119
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,200
hilarious. I want to be him or I'm gonna

1120
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,880
be Starbucks. Starbucks's awesome. And

1121
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,200
so, and then each one each player

1122
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,000
actually also has certain traits which

1123
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:49,680
are characteristic of their um the

1124
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,440
player in the show like Tai. He's an

1125
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,440
alcoholic. So, there's a certain

1126
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,359
negative tribute to him if you are in

1127
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,599
certain situations.

1128
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,359
>> Okay. We had he had the back. Well,

1129
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,760
let's say in in live action role playing

1130
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,000
games like uh experience with the

1131
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,640
Assassin's C and stuff, the characters

1132
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,359
are entirely designed by the game

1133
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,079
designers.

1134
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,640
>> Yes.

1135
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,720
>> But you still you still get the the

1136
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,240
players who like take up this character

1137
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,000
become involved with it because all of

1138
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,400
their actions are based on

1139
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,560
>> on what the designer chose to to make

1140
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,240
that

1141
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:27,839
>> character. Yep. That's that's true. I'm

1142
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:31,760
>> um two other games. cosmic encounter uh

1143
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,920
is where like um probably closer to the

1144
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,079
battle situation, you've got you pick a

1145
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,800
a race at the beginning of the game. So,

1146
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,280
it's not a single character, but that's

1147
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,359
effectively the same thing in in that if

1148
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,200
you pick something like the humans, uh

1149
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,440
you have different goals and different

1150
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,200
different powers that you can use in the

1151
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,440
game. Whereas if you play a game like

1152
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,040
Illuminati again, instead of playing an

1153
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,760
individual, you're playing a corporation

1154
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,920
or actually your picking is society for

1155
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,480
for the most part and your actual

1156
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,920
game-winning goals are different for uh

1157
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,560
depending on who you pick.

1158
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,319
>> And part of the and there are certain

1159
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,640
part part of the game is also figuring

1160
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,079
out what certain characters are trying

1161
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,079
how certain characters are trying to win

1162
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,760
the game. Um because not everybody has

1163
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,560
the same game for

1164
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,440
>> Okay, Patrick, last one.

1165
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,000
In and the card game sabotur, if your

1166
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,680
role is the sabotur, then it is in the

1167
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,119
player's best interest to act in that

1168
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,800
role

1169
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,640
>> to like perform like one.

1170
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,000
>> Yes. To be subversive to the other

1171
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,480
players without like letting them catch

1172
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,920
on.

1173
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,079
>> Oh. Oh. So you see, and this is why I

1174
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,680
didn't do this and I was asking because

1175
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,520
I know this much better. But yeah, I

1176
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,960
think the the laring one is the the

1177
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,520
obvious case here. Um, in video games,

1178
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,720
you know what we do? you know, we can

1179
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,560
build character in kind of like

1180
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,200
cinematic ways and cut scenes and

1181
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,920
whatever, but really, you know, it's

1182
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,800
very difficult to build a character um

1183
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,200
that is at the same time you and not you

1184
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,960
or the the player and not the player. Uh

1185
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,119
and what we can do, you know, is giving

1186
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
cues about

1187
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,359
the personality of that character. And

1188
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,599
one of the the examples I want to give

1189
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,440
is Sonic because Sonic is not really

1190
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,440
you. I mean this is always the a bit of

1191
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,800
the struggle in a lot of the examples

1192
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,640
that you were doing you know except for

1193
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,400
lapping where lapping is bit more

1194
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,240
involved is that it's kind of like you

1195
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,359
but not you like who am I you know I'm

1196
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,720
the sabotur because I'm doing this um in

1197
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,880
in in uh in games we have Sonic for

1198
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,160
example with like you know we are Sonic

1199
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:38,079
what what are we hedgehog

1200
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:42,000
um and what do we do

1201
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:46,000
>> like run coins and cute animals

1202
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,040
>> and liberating cute animals.

1203
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,599
>> Yes, that too. Uh and one of the things

1204
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,960
so so one of the the the the goals of of

1205
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,599
designing character particularly in

1206
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,920
video games is making it seem alive you

1207
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,839
know making it go beyond the functional

1208
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,079
part you know like oh we're the sabotur

1209
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,640
we are I don't know whatever character

1210
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,400
in a clue for example you having that

1211
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,839
emotional involvement that is something

1212
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,800
that that we are trying to achieve in in

1213
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,599
in video games and Sonic does it in a

1214
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,839
very subtle but very cool Okay. Does

1215
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,000
anybody know what this picture is of?

1216
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,000
What he's doing?

1217
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,880
>> Don't do anything. He starts tapping his

1218
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,839
foot and looking at you.

1219
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,160
>> So, it's kind of like you have no

1220
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,839
control of me. Come on. I want to go.

1221
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,640
You know, I really have to go. I have to

1222
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,760
run cuz what I do is running. So, let's

1223
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,680
go.

1224
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,319
>> Mario goes to sleep.

1225
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,079
>> Yeah, Mario sleep.

1226
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,560
starts to

1227
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,800
>> and if you remember any of the Earthwork

1228
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,640
gym Earthworth gym games like he does

1229
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,440
crazy stuff. He's just like he starts

1230
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,960
like

1231
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,720
>> he flips his head, he dresses up like he

1232
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,839
was like in one of like

1233
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,800
>> Yeah. or like he gets an afro

1234
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,000
uh uh wig at some point and like what

1235
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,000
are you doing? You know, but it's kind

1236
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,960
of like calling attention to like who am

1237
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,400
I? You know, well, you're not

1238
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,240
controlling me. I'm going to be myself.

1239
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,280
And in the case of Sonic, it's like,

1240
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,800
okay, I'm a running guy, but I need you

1241
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,240
to run, so come on. Um, and it's very

1242
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,680
subtle, you know, something that is very

1243
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,520
minimal, but it's it's building

1244
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,240
character, but it's also kind of telling

1245
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,160
the player who this character is. Um,

1246
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,280
the last thing, and this is something

1247
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,880
that again video games can do very well,

1248
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,319
is something that role playing games can

1249
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:36,160
do very well or or laughing. Uh but I'm

1250
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,760
not sure that you know card games or

1251
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,079
board games can do this. It's

1252
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,240
environmental storytelling. Uh it's

1253
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,119
telling the story in the space as you go

1254
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,480
around as you're examining the space and

1255
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,800
what's going on. You know, a video games

1256
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,560
do what they do very well is uh

1257
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,319
constructing a virtual world that we can

1258
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,079
navigate, that we can explore, that we

1259
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,599
can interact with. Uh and one of u those

1260
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,040
of you who've been in my classes before,

1261
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,960
you know that I love the beginning of

1262
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,359
Bioshock as an example of environmental

1263
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,960
storytelling. Uh because you know, you

1264
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,240
know what is this world? What has

1265
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,040
happened before? And they don't give you

1266
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,960
they don't tell the word is just going

1267
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,119
into the space and figuring out what has

1268
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,599
happened. Another example that I really

1269
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,920
love is portal.

1270
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,240
um where you know a lot of the story is

1271
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,119
you know told or you you you figure it

1272
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,440
out as you explore the world. So what is

1273
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,599
this import? So first of all what is the

1274
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,480
premise of portal you know this the

1275
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,720
story

1276
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,400
>> you're a test subject testing a new

1277
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,720
device aperture labs.

1278
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,880
>> Yes. So, you're a test subject and but

1279
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,280
but very soon you realize that there's

1280
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,800
something kind of wrong, you know, you

1281
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,520
know, this voice that keeps talking to

1282
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,680
you, you know, kind of warps around and

1283
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,680
she goes and comes back and like there

1284
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,839
is something broken and you just go on

1285
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,560
because you don't know what else to do.

1286
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:00,079
But here, what is this? You know, once

1287
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,839
you start realizing, okay, there's

1288
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,800
something really wrong. What is this?

1289
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,319
>> This is when you try to escape.

1290
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,760
>> There's a hole in the wall.

1291
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,520
>> There's a hole. One of the things is

1292
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,079
like stuck forward. You can sneak under

1293
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,000
or something.

1294
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,760
>> Yeah. And you go behind the scenes and

1295
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,160
you realize, okay, so there is something

1296
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,440
really wrong here and kind of guessed

1297
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,200
it. But here we have what looks like

1298
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,839
somebody's

1299
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,760
uh refuge like some where somebody was

1300
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,200
hiding and they were writing all these

1301
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,440
messages and of course you know it's

1302
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,079
very funny because the famous the cake

1303
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,760
is alive is something is not something

1304
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,839
that everybody has to go through. You

1305
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,520
have to find it. you have to find it in

1306
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,119
the game is is part of the explore in

1307
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,839
the game. So, so what the reason why I

1308
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:46,319
like uh I I like Portal for many many

1309
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,319
reasons. Uh but one is because the

1310
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,119
storytelling is very brilliant and it's

1311
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,040
not you know is is not something that

1312
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,119
we're told. This is what happened. We

1313
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,280
figure it out by listen to to the voice

1314
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,000
by listening to Glados by going behind

1315
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,800
the scenes. We are piecing the the story

1316
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,079
together. Yes. Um, if you ever pay

1317
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,319
attention to what's written in the walls

1318
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,319
in the safe houses and Left 4 Dead,

1319
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,160
>> there's a lot of funny stuff as well.

1320
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,079
And I initially hadn't realized that

1321
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,680
Left had a story really. And then when

1322
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,359
you when you when you actually pause and

1323
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,280
read, you know what's on the walls in

1324
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,800
the safe houses, there's almost flame

1325
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,480
wars between different people who've

1326
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,000
gone to the same houses and are writing

1327
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,680
facts about the zombie apocalypse and

1328
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,440
they'll say, "No, that's not true. That

1329
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,119
town is completely overrun. No, you're

1330
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,800
totally stupid. I was there last you

1331
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,640
have like these things going on and

1332
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,920
various you know tidbits of trivia and

1333
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,440
facts about the world and it's very very

1334
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,520
clever and often quite hilarious

1335
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,599
>> because what this is what environmental

1336
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,480
storytelling is doing after all we're

1337
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,559
telling the story of the fictional world

1338
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,839
you know that can be part of the goal of

1339
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:49,599
of speaking or not what is the story of

1340
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,880
the fictional world you

1341
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,880
guess

1342
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,800
>> um was there's

1343
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,520
use environmental storytelling as story

1344
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,400
What?

1345
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,000
>> Well, you mentioned the difference

1346
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,079
between storytelling and story building

1347
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,240
earlier and you mentioned that that was

1348
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,920
environmental storytelling as a story.

1349
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,559
>> Yeah. And probably is really story

1350
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,400
building. I mean, so the thing is that

1351
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,559
environmental storytelling is what

1352
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,960
people call it. I'm using a phrase, but

1353
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,880
yeah, this is a type of story building.

1354
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,520
>> We're building it as designers and we're

1355
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,680
encouraging building for the player.

1356
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,440
>> But but yeah, this is story building. So

1357
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,359
yes or or um more precisely you will see

1358
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,960
talks on environmental storytelling if

1359
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,520
you go to a conference.

1360
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,119
>> Uh but what they're really talking about

1361
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,280
storytelling it's just that that term

1362
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,079
hasn't really made it so pervasive.

1363
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,079
>> Yeah.

1364
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,880
>> So maybe the closest to this kind of

1365
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,319
thing is in flavor text in CCGs and

1366
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,920
other such stuff. So if you think for

1367
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,920
instance of Magic the Gathering then

1368
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,400
there is a backstory behind each of

1369
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,720
these expansions which comes out

1370
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,319
>> and that's told through actual fiction

1371
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,800
where you can buy really trashy novels

1372
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,040
also partly told through like little

1373
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,559
quotes between uh by significant

1374
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,319
characters in the fiction and also the

1375
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,000
the images which presented on the cards

1376
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,359
and so maybe that's the closest thing to

1377
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,520
environmental storytelling.

1378
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,880
>> Yes. Yeah. I mean Magic the Gathering

1379
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,119
has this world and the things that it

1380
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,839
seems to be very easy to expand it. I

1381
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,800
don't know the survival of of the magic

1382
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,400
the gathering.

1383
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,760
>> Yeah. Like there's an entire creative

1384
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,200
department at visit the coast that's

1385
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,200
responsible for maintaining the story

1386
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,520
and making sure it's all consistent and

1387
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,520
stuff.

1388
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,319
>> Yeah. So it's not really something new.

1389
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,640
Uh it's almost four. So I have still

1390
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,480
something but we can go through it very

1391
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,000
fast. I would hope

1392
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,079
>> I mean if we run out of time we can play

1393
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,920
these games on Friday or something.

1394
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,800
Okay. Absolutely.

1395
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,800
>> So, so we've been talking so far, we're

1396
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,240
talking about uh designing the story of

1397
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,240
the world, designing the story of a

1398
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,839
fictional world, but we also have, as I

1399
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,319
was saying before, you know, the player

1400
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,000
is also constructing a story as we go,

1401
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,720
you know, things that happen to the

1402
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,559
player, um things that that happen to

1403
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,559
the world because they happen to player.

1404
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,319
And again, one of the reasons why I was

1405
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,040
talking about games of progression

1406
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:07,119
versus games of emergence is that in

1407
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:10,559
stories we have a similar parallel of uh

1408
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,119
stories that have been designed for the

1409
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:16,559
player of things that that they have to

1410
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,280
do. uh in role playing games and and I'm

1411
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:22,160
talking about pen and pencil um pen and

1412
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,119
paper role playing games we have the

1413
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,880
story that is as DMs we have designs and

1414
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,400
then there's what the players are trying

1415
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,200
to do in in video games because

1416
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,040
computers don't have the capacity for

1417
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,040
improvisation

1418
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,079
what the player has to do is a lot more

1419
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,920
constraint in a way uh so what are the

1420
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,000
bosses that they have to you know how do

1421
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,200
they solve a specific problem or how do

1422
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,079
we get over a specific problem? So, um

1423
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,160
uh I like giving the example of of um

1424
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,240
the legend the Legend of Zelda games

1425
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:58,079
where we do have a story that we're kind

1426
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,160
of complete completing a specific uh in

1427
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,160
almost in a specific order because if

1428
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,240
you don't have certain objects, you kind

1429
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,720
of go to the next dungeon until you have

1430
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,760
certain properties. So we have even

1431
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,680
though we have a really nice relatively

1432
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,240
open world of the world that we can

1433
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,559
navigate uh we do have a specific order

1434
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,280
of events that we have to follow uh

1435
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,079
adventure games and by this I mean like

1436
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,760
point andclick adventure games uh um

1437
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,200
again things like Siberia things like

1438
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,040
mess where you know there is a

1439
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,440
pre-established sequence of events that

1440
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,760
we have to that we have to fulfill and

1441
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,359
then on the other extreme we have games

1442
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,839
that are closer to you know these games

1443
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,240
like once upon a time or bloom where the

1444
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:41,119
system itself is producing stories of

1445
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,440
sorts uh like the Sims and in the Sims

1446
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,480
the fact that we have a way to record

1447
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,640
our own stories and and share them is is

1448
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,720
proof that that is that's a kind of

1449
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,520
system closer to to things like one song

1450
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,440
at a time that is a system to generate

1451
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,880
narratives and the playing with the with

1452
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,760
the system will generate certain

1453
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:04,400
narratives. Um

1454
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:08,559
so we have um ways in which as designers

1455
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:12,079
we can provide cues or or ways to to

1456
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,760
design the story of the player. Uh and

1457
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,440
the first one is you know the game

1458
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,319
premise you know what is the goal of the

1459
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,559
game uh game events. I don't know if I

1460
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,880
left that one because that was too long.

1461
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,880
Um and we have micro narrative. So the

1462
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,720
the the game premise is you know who are

1463
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,040
you in the game? What do you do? It's

1464
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,559
kind of similar to the to the title, but

1465
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,839
in this case is very tied to who is the

1466
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,040
player, what is the role of the player

1467
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,040
in the game. So things like cooking

1468
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,800
mama, for example, you know, you're

1469
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,119
cooking mama. So who are you in cooking

1470
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,119
mama? You know mama, mom's complaining

1471
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,640
all about it.

1472
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,559
You are the person who's cooking for

1473
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,200
mama. That's the title you should have.

1474
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,359
Cooking for mama and then mama getting

1475
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,800
pissed off at you because you didn't do

1476
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:56,880
it right. Uh but it tells you very

1477
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,240
clearly. Okay, so you're a cook or what

1478
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,319
is it that you do? You're trying to

1479
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,920
please mama by cooking something nice

1480
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:07,520
and yummy. Usually also kind of weird.

1481
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,520
Um, a really good example of of creating

1482
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,000
the story of the the player by the

1483
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,000
premise of by who you are in the game is

1484
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
this.

1485
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,920
So, I love this example

1486
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,720
>> because it's kind of like who are you?

1487
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,559
You're a hacker. And it gives you the

1488
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,720
cool thing about this trailer. It gives

1489
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,040
you a list of what you do. This is your

1490
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,440
story. You are framing people. You're

1491
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,359
framing innocent people, of course, you

1492
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,000
know, changing people academic records,

1493
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,920
building viruses, and all those are are

1494
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,359
activities in the game, but it's also,

1495
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,640
you know, who you are. That is your

1496
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,839
story. Those are the kinds of things

1497
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,200
that you're going to do in the game. Um,

1498
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,000
so again, you know, we were talking

1499
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,240
about Sabotur before. Well, as Sabadur,

1500
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
you already have a series of actions

1501
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,000
that you're associating with with your

1502
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,079
character. That's the way that we can

1503
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,240
design the story of the player at least

1504
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,839
at a at a high level and give it that

1505
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,920
cue. Um I'm skipping game events because

1506
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,119
that's kind of long and it's very based

1507
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,880
on too based in video games um and

1508
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:12,880
mostly on cut scenes. Um the other um

1509
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,480
example that I want to bring here is

1510
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,599
micro narratives. And again, this is

1511
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:20,480
more all these are more a video game

1512
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,559
thing, but micro narratives are little

1513
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,800
events, you know, they're not like even

1514
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,359
cut scenes. They're just little events

1515
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:31,280
that happen as reactions to the player's

1516
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:33,839
actions. In a way, Sonic tapping his

1517
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,040
food is a kind of macro narrative, like

1518
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:38,240
you're not doing anything and it's kind

1519
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,240
of like, come on, I want to go or or uh

1520
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,800
Mario falling asleep. It's it's kind of

1521
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,359
like a micro narrative of sorts. Uh but

1522
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,520
at times I love this is one of my

1523
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,680
favorite macro narratives in the history

1524
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:54,799
of games. This is the game Jack said

1525
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:58,799
Willie which is from 1985

1526
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:01,280
80 something mid80s. Um it was for

1527
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:04,000
Commodore 64. Well it was originally for

1528
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,760
the Spectrum. True. Yes. Thank you. He

1529
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,280
has

1530
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,079
prepared a presentation of the Spectrum.

1531
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,680
Yes. uh Commodore 64, Amsterdam. It was

1532
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:16,720
for all the this uh Z80 U platforms in

1533
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:20,160
the 80s. And this was a sequel to Manic

1534
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,599
Minor. Uh so in Manic Minor, you wear

1535
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,280
minor Willie. Yes, Minor Willie. Uh and

1536
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,880
you go down into the earth and you find

1537
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,960
a treasure and you become immensely

1538
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,680
rich. So, with the money that you get

1539
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,000
from from the first game, you throw a

1540
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,799
party. And you throw such a big party

1541
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,680
that your house becomes invaded by the

1542
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,200
weirdest creatures ever. Um, there are

1543
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:45,599
flying

1544
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:48,400
toilet seats. Um, mutant pigs. I don't

1545
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,480
know. This it's it's Yeah, it's such a

1546
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,880
good party that you get people from

1547
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,240
other worlds to come to your party. Uh,

1548
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,680
but the thing is like it was such a good

1549
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,760
party, you want to go to bed. This is

1550
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,599
Willie. This is this is you in the game.

1551
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,559
So he jets at Willie. This is the the

1552
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:05,119
day after and Willie is hangover

1553
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,960
probably after the super party and he

1554
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,920
was under a bed and in the in the in the

1555
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,920
game uh to the to the left you have the

1556
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,319
picture of a bed and that's kind of like

1557
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,359
your goal. Go to bed. But this is your

1558
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:20,160
land lady who's seen how you trashed the

1559
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:23,359
place and she doesn't want you to go to

1560
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:26,240
bed until you've cleaned it up. So, the

1561
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:30,079
cool thing, and I really want to get an

1562
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:32,799
the animation here, um, is that she has

1563
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,040
her arms like this, you know, she's

1564
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:38,160
holding her her arms like this, and

1565
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:41,040
whenever you get near her, uh, her,

1566
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,400
which which arm is it? Her left arm goes

1567
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,960
like, "H go." And it's a reaction to

1568
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,559
what you do is with those. It's a few

1569
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,960
pixels. It's like probably four or five

1570
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,559
pixels. And in four five pixels, this

1571
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,720
game is telling you this is what you

1572
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,880
have to do. Go that way. This is your

1573
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,200
goal. Yes, but you cannot come here. Go

1574
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,040
that way and clean it up, you know, and

1575
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:05,119
this is, you know, this is 8 bit pixels.

1576
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,720
And she's telling it all bad with just a

1577
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,880
few pixels. You don't really need that

1578
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,359
much. Um, but it's that kind of

1579
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,920
reaction. You know, we always want to to

1580
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,520
get again give cues. What is it that the

1581
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,480
player has to do? We don't need a cut

1582
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:21,599
scene. only with a few with a few pixels

1583
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,440
we know what we have to do right and

1584
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,359
it's a very difficult game too for

1585
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,119
today's standards

1586
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,559
anyway so the conclusion um here is that

1587
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,760
you know why do we need stories or why

1588
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,160
do we need fictions you know what do

1589
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,400
fictional worlds do for us what do

1590
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:39,200
themes uh do for us you know well as

1591
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,480
we're saying you know we have humans

1592
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,599
have a tendency to storyize everything

1593
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,440
we are natural storytellers some of What

1594
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,400
these games like Once Upon a Time or

1595
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,559
Bloom um are playing up with is because

1596
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,960
we are we tell you know other people

1597
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,160
what has happened to us. You know if you

1598
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,599
complain about something you're

1599
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,880
complaining in the in the form of a

1600
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,520
story or something that might have

1601
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,599
happened to you. uh we understand our

1602
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,559
experience as stories and there are you

1603
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,400
know different uh disciplines have have

1604
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:12,559
dealt with this you know from cognitive

1605
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,720
cognitive science to um psychology you

1606
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,400
know how we are so making stories about

1607
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,680
ourselves how we making stories about

1608
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,920
our worlds. So having a story having a a

1609
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,400
a game that has a fictional world in

1610
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,640
which a story can take place is a way of

1611
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,960
understanding the underlying system you

1612
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,200
know by as I was saying you know if we

1613
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,920
have a game that is called mafia word

1614
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,760
wars we already have a goal we have a

1615
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,040
sets of rules you know who we are what

1616
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,040
is it that we have to do uh and we don't

1617
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,280
have we don't need a lot of you know two

1618
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:47,839
words have been enough to evoke a lot of

1619
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,240
those of that information Um, so the the

1620
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,559
other the last thing, and this applies a

1621
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,640
bit more to video games, is that by

1622
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,720
having a story, we're also providing

1623
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,640
consistency to the world. You know, when

1624
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,200
when um Yesper U is talking about uh

1625
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,720
incoherent worlds, he's really talking

1626
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,240
about worlds where, you know, there's

1627
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,839
not really a story and and there are

1628
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,160
video games that have awful stories.

1629
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,680
That's true. But when you're forced or

1630
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,240
where you're thinking about your your

1631
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,240
world as ter not only as a fictional

1632
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,000
world as a simulation but also as a

1633
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,000
world that has to produce a story that

1634
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,079
makes sense you know that is going to

1635
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,079
provide more coherence to the world

1636
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:25,440
hopefully if you have good writers too

1637
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,720
but that mean you can take the director

1638
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,040
for games supposed to uh you know that

1639
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,960
there's there's something and and there

1640
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,599
are things that that Jper complains

1641
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,559
about like the um you know why does

1642
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:42,240
Mario have three lives Well,

1643
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,000
well, because it's Mario, right?

1644
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,839
Uh, you know, is that part of the story?

1645
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,720
You know, that's that's a bit one of

1646
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:51,520
those like no man's land uh kind of kind

1647
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:55,119
of issues like does that undermine the

1648
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,960
consistency of the world? Maybe the onto

1649
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:00,319
the the ontological level, the level of

1650
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,160
the world uh itself. Uh but really, it's

1651
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:04,160
kind of is more about making sense about

1652
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,920
the rules. You know what is it looking

1653
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,920
at being able to look at the world in in

1654
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,440
a critical way? I'm trying to think of

1655
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:14,799
an example of apart from the three lines

1656
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,359
of Mario.

1657
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,720
>> What?

1658
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,000
>> What he says the plumber? Oh, no. That

1659
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,280
was

1660
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,520
>> No, but so for example, uh I don't know

1661
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:29,440
Kirby like he eats

1662
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:31,040
other creatures and spits them.

1663
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,040
You know what? Where does it come from?

1664
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,640
You know, why does he do that? That, you

1665
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,359
know, what is what is the story of

1666
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,960
Kirby? He's a kind of Yeah, he's kind of

1667
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,480
cute, but hey, I would watch out with

1668
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,839
him because he can eat almost anything

1669
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,440
and then he becomes it.

1670
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:46,799
>> Kirby is a really disturbing character.

1671
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,960
>> When you think about it in terms of

1672
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,480
stories, like this is kind of wow.

1673
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,359
>> I mean, Yoshi, right?

1674
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,400
>> Yes.

1675
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,559
>> And I love Yoshi.

1676
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,960
>> Yeah. That's another

1677
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,720
video game charact. It seems like one of

1678
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,040
the reasons why these arguments are

1679
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,400
being raised is because been this huge

1680
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,400
pile of inconsistencies.

1681
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,799
>> Yes, but the inconsistencies become

1682
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,160
evident when you try to write the story

1683
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,640
>> if that makes sense.

1684
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:16,480
>> You know, it's kind of like So,

1685
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:18,960
>> so Yoshi eats creatures and maybe

1686
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,400
>> he poops eggs. He hatches an egg.

1687
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,119
>> Depends on which Mario you're talking

1688
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,559
about. Cuz if it's Super Mario

1689
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,319
Yeah. He poops.

1690
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,599
>> Yeah. And it's like And then he throws

1691
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:29,760
it and they're like bomb.

1692
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,599
>> Yeah. He throws his ank. He uses his

1693
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,599
ank.

1694
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,640
That's true.

1695
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,040
Yoshi is a question.

1696
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,640
>> Yes. But yeah, but all those things

1697
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,400
become evident the moment that we start

1698
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,599
to story. So who is this person? Why did

1699
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,799
they what did they do this? And it's

1700
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,359
kind of like wow. It's kind of like

1701
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:47,920
falling apart. So the incoherence and

1702
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:49,839
I'm just thinking that I don't know if

1703
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,920
like this or not. But the incoherence

1704
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:55,040
comes from the impossibility or or not

1705
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,640
impossibility but but the the problems

1706
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,880
of trying to make this into a story and

1707
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,480
realizing well this has not been this

1708
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,079
has been thought out as a cool game and

1709
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:06,480
I love Yoshi's Island but as the story

1710
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,400
is kind of falls apart. Yeah.

1711
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,960
>> So

1712
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,119
I think one of the the really glaring

1713
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,880
inconsistencies in a lot of RPGs in

1714
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,160
particular is that in most of these

1715
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,799
worlds there's some kind of like

1716
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,480
resurrection power which exists.

1717
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,480
And there are a lot of plots which

1718
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,400
revolve around characters dying and that

1719
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,240
being a bad thing. And you're like, why

1720
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,599
not just use your Phoenix down?

1721
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,359
>> Why do we care if the king's been

1722
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,920
assassinated? I've got this thing in my

1723
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:36,480
inventory from

1724
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,559
resurrecting like a thousand times. And

1725
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,280
now because this guy killed it, like

1726
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,799
what kind of reason?

1727
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,839
>> The actual conceit there is you're not

1728
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:45,359
dead. You're just knocked out.

1729
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,200
>> So it's like smelling salts or

1730
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:49,200
something. But there are games like

1731
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,039
Plscape tournament where that is

1732
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,200
incorporated in the you know you're

1733
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,039
immortal and that's the thing that

1734
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,440
figuring out why you're immortal and why

1735
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,200
you they make fun of of you like waking

1736
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,599
up and it's kind like oh my goodness

1737
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,680
this is really this really hurts I feel

1738
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:07,839
terrible you know and then they're

1739
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:09,839
making they're making that problem into

1740
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:12,480
part of an essential part of the game.

1741
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:15,359
Yes. So, with the RPG thing, the

1742
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,960
incoherency is how so many times when

1743
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,440
you're in these battles, you're doing

1744
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,839
these incredible things like you're

1745
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,920
summoning asteroids or jumping and

1746
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:25,680
destroy people, but then in the in the

1747
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,520
game world, you get to a ledge and it's

1748
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,000
like, oh, it's a ledge. I have to go

1749
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:32,240
around or look, it's a it's a gap like

1750
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,119
this wide. I can't step over it. There's

1751
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,520
a bush. Oh, no. I can't what what am I

1752
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,920
going to do? There's a bush in the way.

1753
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,200
And so,

1754
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:44,880
>> but you put in diagonals, too. What?

1755
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,720
>> No, I'd rather do diagonals.

1756
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,920
>> I think another egregious inconsistency

1757
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,520
that comes up a lot is the uh and I

1758
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,720
think it's in the it's it's explicitly

1759
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,680
mentioned in the reading that that

1760
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:57,839
you're you're the world savior usually

1761
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,039
and on the way you're going to pillage,

1762
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:02,720
steal, kill innocent people, and it's

1763
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,960
not going to be a big deal. and and and

1764
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,559
even in games where they make the

1765
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,160
endpoint variables, they're like, "All

1766
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,480
right, you can neither save the world or

1767
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,520
be a total jerk, and that fixes one

1768
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,680
problem." They still have the problem

1769
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,960
that during the game, you can alternate

1770
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,039
back and forth between being really good

1771
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,240
and really bad. And all it does is it

1772
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,000
kind of swings you one way or the other.

1773
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,920
It's one, it's one dimensional, so you

1774
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,359
just sort of a spectrum, and if you do

1775
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,559
five really bad things and then five

1776
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,359
really good things, you're back to where

1777
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,440
you started. Yes.

1778
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:29,359
>> And that's not necessarily consistent,

1779
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,359
you know, uh,

1780
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:34,000
>> in terms of storytelling. There's also

1781
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:36,160
the the classic inconsistency of if I

1782
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,839
don't save the world, everything will be

1783
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:42,359
destroyed, but you're still going to

1784
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:42,359
charge me a 100 gill for this Phoenix.

1785
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,520
>> It's still inconsistent

1786
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,799
>> and and or I have to say to the world

1787
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,359
now because bad things are happening.

1788
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,760
Let me go do these 20 side quests first.

1789
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,400
>> It's still marching. But yeah, I can

1790
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,079
>> this cat stuck in a tree.

1791
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,559
>> The rat's in the cellar, man. Rats in

1792
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,920
the cell.

1793
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,000
>> Yeah. It's like the end of the world is

1794
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:04,559
nine. Like in Final Fantasy, the end of

1795
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,280
the world is nine, but let me go around

1796
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,799
more more random characters so that I

1797
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,480
can bump up my

1798
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,319
>> So that actually reminds me of I think

1799
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,960
it was a web comic I read about a month

1800
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:17,200
ago and it had like it was based around

1801
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,400
Link. I was like, "Oh my god, you're our

1802
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,319
savior. You're going to help us." I was

1803
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,839
like, "Yes, I am." And so the whole

1804
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,160
whole time he's just going on Cypus

1805
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,920
like, "What are you doing? They're

1806
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,280
raping and pillaging everything. They're

1807
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,960
destroying everything. What are you What

1808
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,400
are you doing?" Oh. I'll do that in a

1809
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,520
second. I just have to get this really

1810
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,520
fairly cool shield. It's like and then

1811
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,599
and then at one point it's like why what

1812
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,119
are you doing? It's like I'm fishing so

1813
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:42,480
I can get this litter so I can catch

1814
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,480
some other fish. Like why why would you

1815
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,480
ever be doing this right now when the

1816
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,319
world's about to end and evil is

1817
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,079
spreading across everything. It's like

1818
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,520
don't worry about it. I'm on it.

1819
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,359
>> Well, it's very interesting. And then

1820
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,400
this is my last last slide. So if you

1821
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:56,160
want to

1822
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,680
>> we can go on discussing. Sure we can

1823
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,680
have. Okay. So um at times you know the

1824
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:03,599
little cues that are building world or

1825
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,720
building character can also backfire.

1826
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:09,520
So, I've been playing one of the DS uh

1827
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,680
Zelda games, and this one of the nicest

1828
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,119
touches is that whenever you get near a

1829
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,280
character, you know, Link is going to

1830
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,119
look at them in the eye like, "Hi," you

1831
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,440
know, like you're walking and stuff

1832
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,960
like, "Hi," you know, and at times it's

1833
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,319
super weird because they look the

1834
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,480
characters look at each other like they

1835
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,640
acknowledge that they're there. So, they

1836
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,119
feel kind of alive, you know, it's very

1837
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,319
simple, you know, 3D algorithm like,

1838
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,520
"Okay, if there's another character,

1839
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,280
they look at each other." It's like,

1840
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,039
"Wow, they're alive. Cool." and they

1841
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,160
react. But then you go into somebody's

1842
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,720
house and they're looking at you and

1843
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,960
you're like, "Hi, you know, you break

1844
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:43,359
their pots to get rupees and they're

1845
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,839
looking at you and you're like breaking

1846
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,760
everything and it's kind of like it's

1847
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,039
kind of weird. They should react because

1848
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,440
they're looking at you and you're

1849
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,200
breaking their house,

1850
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,240
you know, and and that's, you know,

1851
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,319
again, it's giving a touch that is

1852
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,680
giving you making those characters

1853
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:01,119
alive, but it's also kind of like

1854
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:03,760
breaking it like kind of I'm still

1855
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:06,799
breaking your thoughts. That's better.

1856
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,480
>> I think that was uh subverted in um what

1857
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:11,920
was it?

1858
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,359
>> No. In another Zelda game, um

1859
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,680
>> Link's Awakening.

1860
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:17,199
>> You go into the shop and the shop owner

1861
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,319
is always looking at you. So, if you

1862
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,759
take something off the shelf and try and

1863
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,679
exit, he says, "No, you can't do that.

1864
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,000
You can't uh steal it." But if you run

1865
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,759
around him, he's not fast enough to keep

1866
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,960
his eye on you. So, you run around him

1867
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,359
until he's looking away and you can

1868
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,120
leave.

1869
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,400
But if you come back in, he says,

1870
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:36,359
"You're the guy who stole something."

1871
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,359
And then he shoots you with the laser.

1872
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,040
>> The character in the game calls you a

1873
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,799
thief. The rest of

1874
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,960
>> the game. That's very funny.

1875
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:44,960
>> That's awesome.

1876
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,640
>> I was going to say like Oblivion and

1877
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,159
Fallout do the same sort of like where

1878
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,359
everyone watches you like if they're

1879
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,880
within like

1880
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,159
>> they're acknowledging you and then like

1881
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,679
you try and take something like they'll

1882
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:55,679
run up and be like why the hell are you

1883
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,799
taking my stuff or like start you know

1884
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,480
beating you up or whatever. What should

1885
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,880
they do? people called the town guard.

1886
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,239
>> Yeah.

1887
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,440
>> And everyone

1888
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,359
>> problematic when you're powerful enough

1889
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,480
and you can take the town guard

1890
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,839
>> and it's just really annoying cuz

1891
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,199
everywhere you go there's like guys you

1892
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:09,759
can kill that kind of there and you're

1893
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,319
like all right come on get out of my

1894
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,839
way.

1895
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:15,279
>> Yeah. So there was a Mega Man Legends

1896
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,960
which I don't know if anybody ever

1897
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:19,440
played. I don't think anyone played

1898
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:22,719
that, but um essentially it was like

1899
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,400
Mega Man, but the RPG style game, but it

1900
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,319
was actually slightly different from

1901
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,000
most RPGs. And that most RPGs, you just

1902
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,080
walk around walking into people's houses

1903
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,839
looking for loot. But you actually

1904
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,920
couldn't just walk into people's houses.

1905
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:35,440
Their doors would be locked and like you

1906
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,199
could knock and see if anybody was

1907
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,719
there. But it was kind of interesting

1908
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,759
because like it was actually consistent

1909
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,279
in the sense that you couldn't just

1910
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,199
randomly walk into somebody's house and

1911
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,640
steal their crap.

1912
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:46,799
>> There's one thing. So one thing that I

1913
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,480
wanted to ask you because all these

1914
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:50,400
things in in video games you know after

1915
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,199
a while the kind of result evident right

1916
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:57,120
because we have we have the possibility

1917
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:58,960
of having fleshed out uh uh worlds that

1918
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,840
we can interact with you know that are

1919
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:04,080
simulated and the the times when those

1920
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,600
cracks are showing you know what system

1921
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,520
is showing when they're showing that

1922
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,520
this is limited that we've chosen a

1923
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,760
specific level of abstraction to to

1924
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:18,320
simulate the the world. Um, but do those

1925
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:22,800
in congruities bother people in board

1926
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:25,040
games or card games so much?

1927
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,199
>> I I would argue that sometimes it's a

1928
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,800
little bit of a speed bump to learning

1929
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,719
what's going on. Uh,

1930
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,199
assuming it's unmet, assuming that that

1931
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:38,159
that that is incoherent.

1932
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:40,320
It seems like because it's almost

1933
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:42,000
impossible to play a car game or a board

1934
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,159
game without first understanding the

1935
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,199
rules unlike in computer games where you

1936
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:49,440
can just jump right in. Um

1937
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:51,920
that is usually something that can be

1938
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,239
surmounted if people are if people sort

1939
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,480
of say oh the rules say this but the

1940
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,120
theme says that okay I understand what

1941
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,199
the rules say.

1942
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,480
>> Yeah. Able to step over that.

1943
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,760
>> Yeah. And I think that that's an

1944
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,920
excellent point that when we start

1945
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,679
playing a board game and probably when

1946
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,040
what you guys do in this class is you

1947
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,800
get a new board game of what do you do?

1948
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,400
You pick up the instructions

1949
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,360
>> and you're figuring out the rules first

1950
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,080
and not the world. In a lot of video

1951
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,679
games, we figure out the world first and

1952
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,679
then by exploring the world, we're

1953
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,520
figuring out the rules. And even if

1954
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,560
there are games that are giving us

1955
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,679
tutorials or you know manuals who I

1956
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,400
don't know, not many people read manuals

1957
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,000
if at all

1958
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:33,600
>> while the game is installed.

1959
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,239
>> Yes, if it's fun. Um but but you know

1960
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,440
like manuals is not something that even

1961
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:39,360
though it's going to be the first thing

1962
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:45,199
to look at in a board game and a card

1963
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:47,440
game. Um and even well as a player

1964
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:49,520
no as a player you'll also look at the

1965
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,760
rule books at least to cons to build

1966
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,120
your own character most times.

1967
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,480
>> You mean you mean on PC

1968
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,000
>> on roleplay games?

1969
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,480
>> Oh in in are you talking about tabletop

1970
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,440
role playing?

1971
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,199
>> Yes tabletop.

1972
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,000
>> Oh yeah even tabletop role playing games

1973
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,440
you Yeah,

1974
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,440
>> chances are people start by looking at

1975
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,239
the handbooks before

1976
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:11,120
>> laring might be a good example of how

1977
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,840
like laring you just giving your

1978
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,760
>> your character

1979
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,280
>> your character which is very

1980
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,440
interesting.

1981
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,520
>> I mean for role playing I know a lot of

1982
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,520
people who can't really be bothered to

1983
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,920
learn the rules that thoroughly prefer

1984
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,440
just to like experience the story and

1985
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,120
have somebody tell them how to resolve

1986
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,880
mechanics and that kind of thing. Yeah,

1987
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,719
>> but even it's funny because even when

1988
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,880
you are not when you're building your

1989
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,080
character in in a tabletop role playing

1990
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,800
game,

1991
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,880
>> you still have to have a look at, you

1992
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,480
know, what is the race that you want,

1993
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,719
what is your religion, what is your

1994
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,719
powers that you want to choose. You'll

1995
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,560
you kind of really, even if you're only

1996
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,760
playing for, you know, for cakes and you

1997
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,080
don't care so much about the moves and

1998
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,239
I'm I'm the type of tabletop role

1999
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,280
playing that prefers the story and I

2000
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:57,679
don't care so much about combat. Um, but

2001
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,040
you still have to know the rules even

2002
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,440
before you start playing, if that makes

2003
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,520
sense.

2004
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,280
>> I mean, there are situations like Owens

2005
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,719
describing where people don't look at a

2006
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,239
rules, but then then they're usually

2007
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,520
relying on the GM to tell them what's

2008
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,199
allowed and what's not allowed, which

2009
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,480
means someone read the rules. It's no

2010
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:12,880
different from someone explaining to you

2011
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,320
a card game as opposed to having rules.

2012
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,719
>> Actually, kind of makes the experience a

2013
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,320
bit like playing a computer game. The

2014
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,199
the GM sort of does the blackbox

2015
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,199
arbitration for

2016
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,560
>> Yeah, the GM is your computer. In fact,

2017
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,080
it's more powerful than a computer

2018
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,730
because you can sort of figure out what

2019
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,600
you're actually asking.

2020
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:28,960
[Laughter]

2021
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,960
>> What someone

2022
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,960
>> Yes.

2023
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,440
>> I I have a question about narratives

2024
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,280
actually. So, so one thing about card

2025
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,920
games and board games is that almost

2026
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:45,920
everything that gets revealed or that

2027
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:49,679
happens in the middle of the game um is

2028
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:51,040
usually a play of mechanic. Uh sometimes

2029
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,640
some sometimes there's some loose

2030
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,040
flexibility in like games where they

2031
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,600
allow open negotiation in between in

2032
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,199
between specific plays. But most of it's

2033
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,080
actually in the play of a card and move

2034
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,679
of a piece something like that. And

2035
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,520
especially when you're playing cards,

2036
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,520
you have things like paper text. You

2037
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,880
have things especially um for cards

2038
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,800
where you can just like play them at any

2039
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,880
time. Uh, and um, I've seen micro

2040
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,800
narratives done, at least what I think

2041
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,760
of micro narratives, seem to be done

2042
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,840
really well in those instances. Uh, in

2043
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,600
fact, they're instant cards, right? The

2044
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,880
the, you know, someone tries to do

2045
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,960
something that might win them the game

2046
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,159
and you play this card and that denies

2047
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,920
them the win

2048
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:32,560
>> and but then that's tied up with some

2049
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,159
sort of labor text, some sort of

2050
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,880
thematic element to that card.

2051
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:39,600
>> Well, it could be like the

2052
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,480
uh, Monopoly. What is the type of card?

2053
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,360
There is two type of cards.

2054
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,280
>> Go to jail.

2055
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,360
>> No,

2056
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,440
>> yeah, like the chance and there's chance

2057
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,199
is something that happens to you, but

2058
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,960
there's also community.

2059
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,719
>> The community chest. Thank you. Which is

2060
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,360
something that you play. The difference

2061
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,199
is in and micro narratives here. What it

2062
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,480
means is something it's a reaction to

2063
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,480
players

2064
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,080
>> events. is not something that the player

2065
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,719
chooses to do

2066
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:07,280
>> which is you know that those reaction

2067
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,679
cards those are also part of the

2068
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:12,560
player's narrative and in a way you know

2069
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:14,080
is player is choosing this is going to

2070
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,239
happen now

2071
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,840
>> um this is what gloom is about in this

2072
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,120
is what these two games are about most

2073
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,280
of the time it's kind of like you're

2074
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:23,040
trying to to construct a story and

2075
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,360
you're kind of like trying to tamper

2076
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:28,320
into somebody else's story uh so it's

2077
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,560
that kind of reaction but it's yeah we

2078
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:33,040
would have find a name for it. But um

2079
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,719
yeah, it's the micro narrative is

2080
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,800
referring to something that happens as

2081
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:39,120
reaction. It's not something that the

2082
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,640
player does. Maybe that's

2083
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,159
>> it's often in reaction to what another

2084
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,640
player is doing. So it depends on whose

2085
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:46,560
point of view you're taking. So

2086
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,040
>> I've got a community chess card and I'm

2087
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,360
holding it until somebody else is, you

2088
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,880
know, about to take advantage of a

2089
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,360
position and then I n them.

2090
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,760
>> Yeah. Yeah. And these ones

2091
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,040
>> still in reaction to what we

2092
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,280
>> I just going to mention in terms of

2093
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,040
micro narrative I don't know would this

2094
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,640
be a possible example in the board game

2095
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,080
that we're designing there's a computer

2096
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,520
incentive that you want to hack and

2097
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,440
every time someone tries to hack it it

2098
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,679
gets weaker so it's sort of a response

2099
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,280
to someone doing it actually

2100
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,920
>> would that count as a micro narrative or

2101
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:20,560
was that more of a mechanic

2102
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:22,080
>> it seems I mean as an event

2103
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,600
is an important event it's a change of

2104
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,159
state but I don't know how much of a

2105
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,920
story it is like how you know and this

2106
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:29,679
is there's no science to what

2107
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,199
constitutes an event or not. It's

2108
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,320
something that I'm that's part of my

2109
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,960
research. It's something that I'm trying

2110
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:37,920
to figure out you know what does how can

2111
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:40,560
we identify with an event that is a rule

2112
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,159
and it's also an event in the story. Uh

2113
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,120
because things like disconnecting the

2114
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:47,120
computer or hacking the computer

2115
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,840
yeah that that seems to be clearly an

2116
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,520
event. What if we had you know like each

2117
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,560
time they becomes weaker there is

2118
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,880
something else that you can do. So by

2119
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,880
hacking the computer there is a new

2120
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:02,560
action you know you get access to new

2121
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:05,679
areas of the game or you get uh a new

2122
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:08,400
power up or you get you know it's easier

2123
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:10,239
for example if and I'm totally

2124
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,040
hypothesizing about what your game is

2125
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:15,040
about but if you have a computer that is

2126
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,440
controlling the security of a place

2127
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:22,080
whenever you hack a certain part of the

2128
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:25,840
system it's letting you uh it's letting

2129
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:29,600
you move faster through the board

2130
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:32,239
uh in a way that might be closer to the

2131
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,760
a micro narrative because it does have

2132
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,800
it's a reaction but it's also

2133
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,640
consequences

2134
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,880
>> in that case for careers for girls when

2135
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,239
you choose to go down a path is that

2136
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,560
micro narrative because the player

2137
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:44,239
chooses and then sort of changes the

2138
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,960
state slash gives you more

2139
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:49,360
>> I don't know the choices but the events

2140
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,920
that happen like what happens when you

2141
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,360
land on something might be closer and

2142
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,280
again it's kind of like the micro

2143
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:59,040
narrative.

2144
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:00,960
>> I mean the careers and careers for girls

2145
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:04,320
which if folks haven't seen it is really

2146
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,640
really apparent um seems to be built on

2147
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,320
micro narratives the whole idea that

2148
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,080
everywhere you land something's happen

2149
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,440
some life event is happening

2150
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,040
>> but the choice what I'm saying is that

2151
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,480
the choice itself is not the micro

2152
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:18,080
narrative the landing

2153
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:20,640
>> and what happens when you land.

2154
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,159
>> Oh wow.

2155
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,080
>> Anything else? I actually kind of wanted

2156
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:25,760
to make one last comment about um like

2157
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,120
immersion stories

2158
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,120
>> in particular with the example of the

2159
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,560
Sims. Uh is anybody familiar with

2160
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,280
Allison Kev?

2161
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,960
>> Yeah.

2162
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,560
>> Yeah. So Allison Kev was this really

2163
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,280
interesting experiment that this guy did

2164
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,760
where um he created two homeless Sims.

2165
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:42,000
>> Oh yes. A father and a daughter.

2166
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,400
>> I think we talked about

2167
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,880
>> uh just kind of like did a sort of web

2168
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,280
comic style display of the lives of

2169
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,600
these two homeless Sims like as she grew

2170
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,440
up and he got older.

2171
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,239
And

2172
01:18:53,440 --> 01:19:00,320
it it it almost seemed like it became

2173
01:18:56,239 --> 01:19:02,960
like a role- playinging game where the

2174
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:05,120
guy playing the Sims became the dungeon

2175
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,199
master who had like, you know, created

2176
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,159
these characters and then the AIs were

2177
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:11,840
playing these characters for him. in

2178
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:14,960
particular this there was this one

2179
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:18,640
moment where um he gets to a part of the

2180
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,640
story where uh the the daughter has just

2181
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,120
gotten her first paycheck and she

2182
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,800
decides to donate it to charity and like

2183
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:27,040
he keeps trying to keep her from

2184
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,360
donating it to charity but she keeps

2185
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:31,360
saying I want to donate it to charity so

2186
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,040
eventually he lets her donate it to

2187
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:35,520
charity and it was almost like it was

2188
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,679
the character's choice to donate it and

2189
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,159
he's at the end of this this blog post

2190
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,840
that he did about this specific events.

2191
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:44,080
He's talking about how like, you know,

2192
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,480
what does it mean when a video game

2193
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:49,679
character that you created makes you

2194
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,719
question your own life choices?

2195
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,760
>> I don't know. It's just a really

2196
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,159
interesting thing. If you haven't read

2197
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:58,560
it, you should check it out.

2198
01:19:54,159 --> 01:20:00,560
>> I think it's alphanc.com something.

2199
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,440
>> It's a starting The Sims 3.

2200
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,600
>> Yeah.

2201
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,440
>> Talking about like non-digital games

2202
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,880
being very involved in your character. I

2203
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,000
felt like I feel like the one game I've

2204
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,880
played where I've been very involved in

2205
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,400
a character is Mafia where like there's

2206
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,080
a lot of actual information given to

2207
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,840
you. People are young like you're the

2208
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:21,120
mafia. The way you smiled at him like

2209
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,520
you know clearly you guys. So I don't

2210
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,000
know.

2211
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,159
>> So you become the character more by how

2212
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,840
people see you than

2213
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,360
>> than how you play it.

2214
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,880
>> I guess you're also assigning character

2215
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,600
to other people

2216
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,080
>> reading into their actions. Is it

2217
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,840
>> I heard

2218
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:38,480
>> that's a game where the roles are

2219
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,920
designed by the designer and

2220
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,080
>> there's only two roles. It's like it's

2221
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,640
not

2222
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,080
>> Well, there can be there's a few

2223
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:46,000
>> I've seen websites with like a whole

2224
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,600
list of roles and some of them are

2225
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,600
hilarious.

2226
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,560
>> Seems good.

2227
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,960
>> Yeah.

2228
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:56,000
>> In digital games, I feel like they're

2229
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,679
the games where you have a very defined

2230
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,440
character unlike this. If you have a

2231
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,679
very defined character in the video game

2232
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,360
more was like fable your character isn't

2233
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,040
defined and kind of like changes based

2234
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,120
on the actions you use if you're evil he

2235
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,640
becomes ugly and he gets confessed and

2236
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,480
things but I never felt like I

2237
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:12,719
identified with the character at all

2238
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,000
versus games that already give me a very

2239
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,080
strong character and I'm supposed to

2240
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,920
play a certain way I feel like

2241
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,199
>> that's that's odd because that's

2242
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,560
completely

2243
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,920
>> that runs against what they were trying

2244
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,520
to do or at least that's what their

2245
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,960
marketing claims that they're trying to

2246
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,800
do is to make you feel closer to the

2247
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,480
character because it's the reflection

2248
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,239
Yeah,

2249
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,400
>> I think like Bioshock does a better job

2250
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:33,760
of that where you never see the guy.

2251
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,480
>> So you're always just like looking

2252
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,480
through his eyes and he has essentially

2253
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,560
no personality.

2254
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,320
So at least no personality is displayed

2255
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,320
in the game. So it's almost as if you

2256
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,960
are directly interacting.

2257
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,719
>> Yeah. given a space to be

2258
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,400
>> to to actually like, you know, project

2259
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:53,199
yourself into the game,

2260
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,360
>> which I think is sort of what Fable was

2261
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:57,600
trying to do, but doesn't really do a

2262
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,840
good job of it because you see him right

2263
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,480
there and he's clearly not you. I feel

2264
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,480
like torment is a really plcape Torment

2265
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:07,360
is a really interesting take on this

2266
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:10,480
where the character is essentially like

2267
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,600
who it is that you play him as. But

2268
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,360
there's more to it than that because

2269
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,280
there's also backstory to the character

2270
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,880
which you the character have forgotten

2271
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:19,520
and is revealed to you over time. But

2272
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,080
you're you're no more that character

2273
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,159
>> that was that that your character was

2274
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,440
back then than you are definitely the

2275
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:27,120
character now. So it's kind of your

2276
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,800
nature changes over time and you've gone

2277
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,800
through several iterations of this.

2278
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,159
Yeah. And if you like none of them is

2279
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,280
true or more correct you

2280
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:35,520
>> the funny thing about playscape

2281
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,040
tournament is kind of like a like a

2282
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,880
personality test.

2283
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,920
>> Uh because I've been playing it again

2284
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,600
and last first time I played through I

2285
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,000
was

2286
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:49,760
chaotic good and I was trying to play

2287
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:52,239
different and still chaotic good. So I'm

2288
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,600
kind of freaking out.

2289
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:55,440
Oh, like okay, you know, I'm really

2290
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,480
trying to do something different, but

2291
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:01,600
I'm still in the same alignment. Uh

2292
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:04,080
because a lot of your definition of and

2293
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,600
actually your alignment can also decide,

2294
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,920
you know, items that you can get or

2295
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,239
things that you can do. Um but it's

2296
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,800
based on your choices and how you

2297
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:14,880
tackle, you know, if you do a quest, if

2298
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:18,480
you choose if you lie, for example, or

2299
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:22,320
if you do like crazy things. Um

2300
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:24,480
and and it's not something

2301
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:27,520
Once you realize where you the effect of

2302
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:30,639
your choices is, you can kind of control

2303
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,400
it. But this, you know, like playing is

2304
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,880
kind of like, okay, it's going to be

2305
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,280
about you and how your game playing

2306
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,040
style is majoring personality.

2307
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,800
>> Yeah, there's an interesting effect in

2308
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,760
like Knights of the Old Republic. when

2309
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,520
played that.

2310
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,679
>> Um,

2311
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,440
you you can explicitly make decisions to

2312
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:52,080
become to go to the dark side, but like

2313
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,880
I remember when I played it, every time

2314
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:56,159
it came up with a decision where I could

2315
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,600
like the dark side has all the awesome

2316
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,880
powers, right? So, it kind of funny to

2317
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,080
think of like I'm going to be on the

2318
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,239
dark side. I'm going to have all the

2319
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,159
awesome powers. It's going to be grand.

2320
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:06,480
Um then you get to the decisions and I

2321
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:08,960
was like almost uncomfortable with

2322
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,719
choosing the evil options such that I

2323
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,880
couldn't actually bring myself to go to

2324
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,199
the dark side.

2325
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,000
>> We we are actually out of time but you

2326
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:21,440
know but I wouldn't say that

2327
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,520
>> the the options of of the republic

2328
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:25,920
actually let's let's take discussion of

2329
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,800
the republic

2330
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,000
space.

2331
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,840
>> Yeah.

2332
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,480
>> Okay. All right. Well thanks thanks.

2333
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,480
>> Thank you.
