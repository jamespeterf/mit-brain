1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,560
So today I'm going to share with you

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,720
some of the research that my lab is

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
doing that's focused on understanding

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,719
who is the beneficiaries of genetic

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
research studies and how does that

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,480
translate to who gets benefits in the

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,320
clinic. And so what we are trying to do

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
right now is figure out what can we do

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
to address those disparities even

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,840
without collecting additional data. And

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,720
so we are a human genetics lab. We focus

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
on studying human genetic variation. I'm

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,720
often quite jealous of my colleagues

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
that have a lot more control over their

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
systems. They get to control what their

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,800
mice eat. They can mutate their genomes.

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,640
They can see what happens. I always tell

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,079
everyone, I can't do any of that. I

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
can't control any of the people in my

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
study. All I can do is take advantage of

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
all the things that have already

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,000
happened. What we're doing as a human

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
geneticist is trying to leverage what's

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,719
already existing in the human population

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,120
and then pull insights. So you can

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,920
imagine how quickly confounders can come

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,840
into play here. The very standard way

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,559
that human geneticists try to address

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,640
this type of confounder, not knowing who

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,000
slept well last night, what you had for

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,600
breakfast this morning, whether you made

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,520
a good choice or a bad choice in terms

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,479
of

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,000
exercise without being able to control

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,960
for that. What we do is just collect

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,439
massive amounts of people trying to

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,360
diffuse out those variables so that we

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,840
can determine what are the genetic

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,000
connections to traits despite all of

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,799
those confounding variables. And so this

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
requires pretty large sample sizes and

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,119
as you can imagine very expensive

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
research

44
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,400
studies. In total though, we're looking

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,720
at a very small fraction of your genome.

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
You're about

47
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,200
99.9% similar to every person in this

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,439
room. only 0.1% of your genome is going

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,320
to be different, but the genome is quite

50
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,960
large. So that represents about 6

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
million base pairs of difference. So

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,720
when we're trying to figure out what are

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
the genetic changes that make someone

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,200
develop schizophrenia versus depression,

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,600
we have to look amongst these six

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,119
million base pairs of difference and try

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,079
to pull salient

58
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,399
conclusions. The way this is done

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,720
typically is through these largecale

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,160
association studies. These studies are

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
quite simple on the surface. We're

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,760
collecting large groups of people that

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,000
have a trait and large group of people

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,319
that don't. We then collect all of their

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,879
genetic information and assess genetic

66
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,879
variance one at a time. Do we see an

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,800
association with a particular genetic

68
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
change in people who have the disease

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
versus those that don't? So, we're going

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
to look for genetic differences that are

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,200
found at increased prevalence in the

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
disease population relative to the

73
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,120
controls. These are then said to be

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,720
associated with disease. Now, what's

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,160
tricky here is this may be different

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,480
than some of the genetic information

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,000
you've come across before. Maybe you've

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,879
heard about Down syndrome, which is

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,480
caused by an extra copy of a chromosome.

80
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,400
Every person that has an extra copy of

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,519
that chromosome has Down syndrome. We

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
haven't found a single human where

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,160
that's not true. But for the majority of

84
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,160
diseases in the human population, that

85
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,920
is not a simple pattern. So there's

86
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,920
typically many people that have

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,680
different variants that cause the trait

88
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
we're looking for. So, what we're

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,760
thinking about more is not a genetic

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,080
cause of a trait, but a genetic change

91
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,319
that increases your risk or likelihood

92
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
of developing disease, just like smoking

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,480
increases your risk of lung cancer. And

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,800
so, these large-scale studies go through

95
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
and identify DNA changes that associate

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,599
with increased risk. And then the goal

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
of the biologist is to understand why

98
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,200
those variants would cause you to be at

99
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
increased risk. Could that help us

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,120
figure out how to prevent the disease,

101
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
treat the disease, or even just diagnose

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,879
it so we know what we're looking to to

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
um

104
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,720
affect? So, this type of study has been

105
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,120
performed for about the last 15 years.

106
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,599
Um here's what we've gotten so far. Each

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,680
one of these bars represents one of your

108
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,519
chromosomes, and the little dots are

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,000
representing DNA variants that have been

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,920
linked to a trait. These are all of the

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,319
results we had up into 2008.

112
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,000
By

113
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,680
2012, 2011, we had more. And then

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,439
2015,

115
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,879
2019, by 2020, we're getting off the

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,040
scale of my plot. And I had to downsize

117
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,480
to get enough pixels on this screen so

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,439
that we can see all the results we have

119
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,760
up into 2024. This is what happens when

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,079
sequencing studies start exploding and

121
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,759
people become more interested in

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
understanding their own genomes and

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,160
being um consenting themselves into

124
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,720
genetic studies. What this represents is

125
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,040
600,000 clues about how diseases work if

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
only we could interpret them. So this is

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,560
a huge amount of information that many

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
groups including my own are trying to

129
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,320
figure out why would this set of varants

130
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,040
increase your likelihood of developing

131
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,199
one disease versus

132
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,000
another. What's the problem? The

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,240
discovery cohorts are incredibly biased.

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,759
The vast majority of that data I just

135
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,800
showed you comes from the European

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,120
ancestry populations only. So about 80%

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,759
of all our genetic studies are performed

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,600
only on European ancestry. And this has

139
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,440
led to pretty big disparities in the

140
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
clinic. For example, we have some

141
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,040
genetic variants that we can use to

142
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,039
predict who's likely to develop colon

143
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,880
cancer that are incredibly effective in

144
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,720
Europeans and completely ineffective in

145
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,240
those of Asian descent. So we're

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
thinking about who's benefiting from all

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
this genetic research and what can we do

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,919
to translate that information is a major

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
problem for the human genetics field.

150
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,840
And this is a wellrecoognized problem as

151
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,080
the NIH has put substantial efforts into

152
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,000
increasing genetic diversity. We're now

153
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,680
seeing massive studies being performed

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,400
across different continents across the

155
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
world and more of a concerted effort to

156
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
engage with populations that may have

157
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,520
been reticent to be involved in genetic

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
genetic studies. But this takes time and

159
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,240
money. Collecting thousands and

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,479
thousands of genomes takes decades,

161
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,440
takes very long time, and allows you to

162
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,039
finally fully pull some

163
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,440
associations. In the meantime, what kind

164
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,960
of things can we do? Can we start to

165
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,199
think about different ways that we

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,199
analyze the data in order to pull

167
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,560
information from some of these smaller

168
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,319
studies that represent um these

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,919
populations that are pretty much um

170
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,280
missing from the benefits of genetic

171
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,199
research.

172
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
Not only are some populations missing,

173
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,639
some diseases are also underrepresented.

174
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,479
So you can imagine where voting in

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,400
Congress and their choices about NAH

176
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,039
funding has also influenced all of this

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,120
results. Uh breast cancer very well

178
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,080
studied, Alzheimer's disease very well

179
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,919
studied, opioid addiction, not so much.

180
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,199
Right? So there are some traits that

181
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,440
have historically not been as well

182
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,160
funded in the um federal research which

183
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,840
has led to these cohorts being under

184
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,440
reppresented. And so our goal here is to

185
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,000
try to develop methods that allow us to

186
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,160
pull insights now instead of waiting for

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,919
new data. And the way that we go about

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
this is trying to think more deeply

189
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,960
about how the genome functions in

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,240
changing the models to find effects

191
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,560
despite not having huge power. So one of

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,520
the areas that we focus on specifically

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,000
is opioid addiction. Uh this is a pretty

194
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,240
critical public health crisis. Since

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,880
2017, opioid overdoses have been the

196
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,280
leading cause of accidental deaths, even

197
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,120
surpassing that of automobile accidents.

198
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,639
Uh, and this was only exacerbated during

199
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,919
the 29 co9 pandemic. So, it's a massive

200
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,599
problem. But you may be asking

201
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,919
yourselves, what is is this a genetics

202
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,800
problem? Right? So, is addiction a

203
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,280
genetics genetic trait? And we can ask

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,199
that question by looking at twin

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,880
studies. So take advantage of a very

206
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,199
naturally occurring phenomenon where the

207
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,919
same genome is born into two individuals

208
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,319
and ask do you see a correlation in

209
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,560
their phenotypes? Do you see individuals

210
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,880
who were born with the same genome but

211
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,039
raised in separate environments having

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,199
the same trait? And in doing this type

213
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,560
of analysis you find that opioid use

214
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,199
disorder is about 60% heritable. Height

215
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,759
is about 90% heritable. Schizophrenia

216
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,599
about 80%. So it's right along these

217
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,199
lines. Maybe a slightly larger

218
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,440
environmental component, but still

219
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,680
clearly a major role for

220
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,680
genetics. But the problem is that we

221
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,680
have not discovered what are the

222
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,160
underlying genetic causes or

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,759
contributors to opioid addiction. For

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,759
most diseases, we're talking about

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,000
hundreds of genetic risk factors have

226
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,520
already been identified. For opioid use,

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,160
we're maybe five known risk factors. um

228
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,520
and they're all involving actual opioid

229
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,720
receptors and cellular

230
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,680
processes. This has largely been

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,719
attributed to sample size and power, but

232
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,479
also some of this is due to the fact

233
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,919
that addiction might just be a more

234
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,080
complicated trait. More variables are at

235
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,440
play that make each individual with

236
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,360
opioid use disorder slightly different.

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Different causes would make it very

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,839
difficult to pull together, especially

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,080
in small cohort studies.

240
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
So you can think of opioid use disorder

241
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,760
and other related uh types of substance

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,760
use disorders as multiple stages where

243
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,800
first there is an experience of exposing

244
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,800
to the drug, a binging period typically

245
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,720
followed by withdrawal, withdrawal

246
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,560
symptoms leading to relapse and

247
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,839
recreating this cycle over and over

248
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,600
again. In each stage of this disease,

249
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
there are different opportunities for

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,399
genetic risk factors to come into play

251
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,880
and different causes to cause the trait.

252
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
So, for example, who's going to be

253
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,279
exposed to an opioid to begin with?

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,680
Well, there are genetic connections here

255
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,000
to someone's impulsivity or willingness

256
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,120
to take risks. There's actually genetic

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,640
factors underlying that ease of access.

258
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
So, there's some social factors. Some

259
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
people are not going to be prescribed an

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,640
opioid in the clinic and some will be

261
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,560
more likely to. Some may have higher

262
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,560
pain tolerance and say after that after

263
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,959
that orthopedic surgery I do not want to

264
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,399
take the opioid. I'm going to stick with

265
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,080
ibuprofen. Right? So there may be

266
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,279
differences at all those levels that

267
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
have different genetic

268
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,839
correlations. We also see massive

269
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
variation in one's response to opioids.

270
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,160
Maybe you've been prescribed an opioid

271
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,000
before. Some people experience euphoria.

272
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,279
Some have pretty nasty side effects and

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
don't want to continue taking their

274
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,160
dosage. So, it really depends. And it

275
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
turns out if you enjoy your first opioid

276
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,600
experience, you're 20 times more likely

277
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,040
to have addiction in the future. So, if

278
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,560
you have anyone in your life that has

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
ever have been prescribed an opioid,

280
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,079
describes a very happy feeling

281
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,240
afterwards, maybe help them monitor

282
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,560
their intake until their uh prescription

283
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,560
has run its

284
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,240
course. The other challenge here is the

285
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,839
withdrawal. Some people experience much

286
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
more severe withdrawals making them much

287
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,519
more prone to relapse and that's

288
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,640
incredibly problematic because that is

289
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,560
where overdoses tend to occur. So it's

290
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,279
in this relapse phase that we see the

291
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,399
majority of opioid overdose deaths

292
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,040
occurring rather than like the first

293
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,800
exposure stage. So you're talking about

294
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,959
a trait that's not only underststudied

295
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,360
but multiffactorial with distinct

296
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,120
causes. you can see where the challenge

297
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,600
lies and why we haven't made much

298
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,320
progress in understanding the genetic

299
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,880
risk for this trait. And so we've been

300
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,120
tackling this question looking at these

301
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,800
smaller disease studies but trying to

302
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,519
account for this heterogeneity this

303
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,519
mixture of causality. And so we can

304
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,760
study genetics by looking directly at

305
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,160
the sequence. But we can also study

306
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,480
genetics by looking at the output of DNA

307
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,560
sequence. We can look at the genes and

308
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
what kind of products they make, the RNA

309
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,720
molecules that are produced, the

310
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,440
proteins that are produced, and then a

311
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,519
specific type of element that my lab

312
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,640
studies, which is the element that

313
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,200
controls that process. So, your body has

314
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,519
to dictate which genes are turned on and

315
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
off in different contexts. It's one of

316
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,680
my favorite things to teach the

317
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,200
undergraduates because it's something

318
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,600
they know, but they don't know that they

319
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
know it, right? You only have one

320
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,760
genome. You have this basically the same

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,200
genome in every cell of your body. Yet

322
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,240
your heart beats, your neurons send

323
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,920
impulses, your immune cells fight

324
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,600
pathogens, all coming from one single

325
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,519
blueprint. And so understanding how that

326
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,640
happens is all about controlling which

327
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,480
genes are turned on and off at what

328
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,560
time. And so this process called gene

329
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,120
regulation is what we focus on. It's

330
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,120
this effect of these little triangle

331
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,040
represented elements that decide when

332
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,200
those RNA molecules are produced.

333
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,440
Turns out majority of our genetic risk

334
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,040
is actually coming from disrupting these

335
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,560
regulatory elements and not the proteins

336
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,639
themselves. And so our approach was to

337
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
go directly at patient tissues and

338
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,680
capture these gene regulatory elements

339
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,680
and ask how they are disrupted in

340
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
addiction.

341
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,040
We collected about a hundred individuals

342
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,200
who either died of an opiate overdose or

343
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,920
died of an accidental death, typically a

344
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,800
motorcycle accident, to compare their

345
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,399
brain tissue samples and did a

346
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,680
experiment that allows us to look at

347
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,480
those regulatory element

348
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,959
activity. To give you a sense of what

349
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,800
the data looks like, this is one tiny

350
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,320
fraction of the genome of your six

351
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,160
billion base pairs. This represents

352
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,079
about uh 20,000 base pairs right here.

353
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,880
And these little squiggles represent

354
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,160
which gene regulatory elements are

355
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,680
active. How you interpret this data

356
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,279
requires a number of different

357
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,639
strategies. So we're not going to go

358
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,240
into too much detail, but I always think

359
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,480
it's interesting to see what these

360
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,480
traces look like. And how do you go

361
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,639
through and look at the entire genome

362
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,760
and decide what differences are actually

363
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,600
interesting or valuable to study.

364
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,720
The standard approach is to try to go

365
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,839
through and identify something that is

366
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,560
consistent, something that is different

367
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,120
in everyone who has the trait that the

368
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,440
controls all have something different.

369
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,800
So for example, we'd look for an element

370
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,600
where the big triangle peak here is high

371
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,720
in all of our controls and flatlined in

372
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,639
all of our cases. You can use a lot of

373
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,360
straightforward modeling, some linear

374
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,480
regression type analyses to identify

375
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
these consistent

376
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,639
changes. This often results in very

377
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,279
little information from small studies

378
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,360
because you're requiring consistency.

379
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,680
What we wanted to do is allow for that

380
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,839
heterogeneity. And so instead of

381
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,000
portfoling these sort of standard strong

382
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,160
impact analyses, we look for changes

383
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,040
that are specific to each individual

384
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,040
with opioid addiction. So say of our

385
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,920
control population, this is what we

386
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,320
expect to happen. Is there any novel

387
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,920
information, any surprising information

388
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,600
in the one sample that has opioid use?

389
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,560
So we're performing this very highly

390
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,639
individualized analysis.

391
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,800
So here's a little cartoon view of what

392
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,360
this looks like. This is what standard

393
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,920
approaches look for. A small reduction

394
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,959
that's consistent in hill height or

395
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,440
triangle height in this cartoon. What

396
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,959
our approach does is looks for changes

397
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,360
that are more akin to here where it's

398
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,120
consistent in the controls and then one

399
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
individual has a big change that's

400
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,079
really unexpected.

401
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,199
We can go through and define these types

402
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,040
of changes for every

403
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:08,959
individual and look at what comes out of

404
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,480
it. And as you might expect, when you

405
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,240
apply an analysis looks for

406
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,959
individuality, most of the things are

407
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,120
individual specific. Only about 10% of

408
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,920
these changes are found in more than one

409
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,199
person with opioid

410
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,480
addiction. But what the way is

411
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
interesting about how these elements

412
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,639
work is they don't work independently.

413
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,199
So these individual elements that are

414
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,560
controlling genes, they actually work in

415
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,720
combinations. So all of these little

416
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,600
triangles here are responsible for

417
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,199
controlling the same gene. And so we

418
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,160
start by linking all of these

419
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,720
differences back to the genes that they

420
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,040
control. And then we suddenly see a lot

421
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,720
higher degree of convergence across our

422
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,720
opioid cases. So of the elements that we

423
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,440
identified as being individual specific

424
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,279
only 10% were found in multiple patients

425
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,360
but if we focus on the genes that are

426
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,800
affected by those little triangle

427
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,199
changes then we see that happening in

428
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,279
60% happening in multiple patients. So

429
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,079
what we've been working on with the help

430
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,959
of the seed grant is how to formalize a

431
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,880
convergence analysis. How do we quantify

432
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,839
the areas of the genome where there's

433
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,800
the most overlap or grouping of these

434
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,759
individual specific changes? We started

435
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,560
applying this to our opioid cohort and

436
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,279
found five major genes linked in our

437
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,120
first brain ho brain study and 50

438
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,199
additional genes in our second brain

439
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
study. We're really excited about these

440
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,279
results. We started looking at these um

441
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,360
in this in cell culture. So in in

442
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,279
neurons growing on plastic. uh we're

443
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
seeing some very interesting insights

444
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,360
about the role of insulin signaling in

445
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,320
addiction. Uh so with this analysis

446
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,399
we're now formalizing to enable us to

447
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,680
think about these target genes and apply

448
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,120
them to other traits such as

449
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,959
schizophrenia and

450
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,120
autism. So that I'll wrap up. Um so this

451
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,720
is a work across a number of individuals

452
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,880
and I want to make sure I highlight the

453
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,959
cohort of individuals that allows us to

454
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,799
collect this data. We do not do any

455
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,160
autopsies or dissections. we have

456
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,520
collaborators that collect the data so

457
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,199
we can focus on the computational

458
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,640
analysis and that's this group of

459
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,640
researchers here. So thank you very

460
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
much.

461
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,039
Thank you so much. Questions for Olivia.

462
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Thank you. This was fascinating and very

463
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,840
well presented. Um my question is is I I

464
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,480
applaud you for looking at opiate

465
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,960
addiction. It's um such a huge problem,

466
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,600
but it's also a highly stigmatized one.

467
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,120
And my question is about the ethics of

468
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,880
like once you have um actionable data

469
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,559
that could be useful in a clinical

470
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:55,039
setting, how would you work with the

471
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,880
ethics around that? And particularly um

472
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,720
in this moment where we have a lot of

473
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,240
mistrust of science and um you know

474
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,000
things like like the the 23 and me

475
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,200
acquisition are are really making people

476
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,679
very anxious about what people might do

477
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,080
with genetic information about them. How

478
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,000
would you think about that and where

479
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,039
would we even begin? Yeah, it's a great

480
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,520
question. It's something we think about

481
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,960
a lot because of all the diseases we

482
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,520
study, this is the only one that's fully

483
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,880
preventable. Right? So, never exposed to

484
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,760
a substance, you're not going to develop

485
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,160
addiction, right? But there's a huge

486
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,400
risk of applying this type of result to

487
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
the clinic without thinking about those

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,400
types of boundaries. So, say we could

489
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,080
predict who's at highest risk for

490
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
addiction. Does that mean they shouldn't

491
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,760
be prescribed a painkiller? Probably

492
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,280
not, right? Until we have some new

493
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,120
alternatives. That's some very exciting

494
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,720
new painkillers are on the market now.

495
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,600
So, hopefully we can start phasing out

496
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,520
prescription use. Um, but what we want

497
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,440
to think about is ways of increasing

498
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,960
monitoring. Maybe if you're a high risk,

499
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,280
it's not that you don't get access, but

500
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,480
you'll get a week at a time prescription

501
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,799
instead of a month at a time

502
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,880
prescription. So, more intervention.

503
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,600
Some places, I think it's uh common in

504
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,840
Texas, for example, to not prescribe

505
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,520
opioids in the orthopedic surgery

506
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
center, but to refer them to a pain

507
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,559
clinic. So this just this extra step of

508
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,039
having to contact a pain clinic to talk

509
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,679
to a doctor to get access to an opioid

510
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,000
actually reduces overall opioid intake.

511
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,679
So there are there are ways in which we

512
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,559
can monitor this sort of making sure

513
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,520
that people have the knowledge but also

514
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,640
the policies to keep how we would

515
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,400
restrict access very carefully selected.

516
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
Um we also have to be super

517
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,799
conscientious of the way we design these

518
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,880
studies. uh the very first like machine

519
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,120
learning model for addiction predicted

520
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,480
race and not addiction. Um so you can

521
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,919
imagine how quickly that could be

522
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,799
problematic if applied in the clinic.

523
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,720
Great.

524
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:57,360
Hi. Um I had a question if you were

525
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,520
considering also hyonic activity or

526
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,440
transcription factors because you said

527
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,400
regulatory ailments but I'm not sure

528
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,720
which one you implied with that. And

529
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
also if you're talking about one or the

530
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,919
other. Are you considering the activity

531
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,440
of the other one? Yes. Yeah. So, we're

532
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,280
we're actually measuring histone

533
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,440
modification. So, when I talk about a

534
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,600
regulatory element, we're measuring uh

535
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,919
the proteins that are altered that

536
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,520
control how the genome is folded. Um,

537
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,520
and what I didn't have time to go in

538
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,919
today is we started predicting what

539
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
might be driving these changes. And so

540
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
we have a few transcription factors that

541
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,520
we think are candidates for causing

542
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,360
these effects and then they might be

543
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
better um therapeutic targets because

544
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,000
they cause many downstream effects. So

545
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,919
good question.

546
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,480
Any further yes then

547
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,480
thank you. Um I understand this is uh

548
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,559
this research is heavy on genetics but I

549
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,559
was wondering if this um research

550
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,400
accounted for environmental factors at

551
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,400
all. Yeah. So, you know, a lot of our

552
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,400
models attempt to, right? We look at

553
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,159
things um like age, um the substance

554
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,760
that you're using. Um that's one of the

555
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,760
hardest things to control for. Most

556
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,880
people with opioid addiction are poly

557
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,559
substance users, so they're using

558
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,960
fentanyl as well as heroin or some mix

559
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,120
thereof. Um and so that can really be a

560
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
major confounder. Um age is another big

561
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,159
one. Surprisingly, the biggest

562
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
confounder is something called the

563
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,880
post-mortem interval. So, the time

564
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,840
between death and tissue collection. And

565
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,919
so we can try to model that effect out

566
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,400
but we have to be very aware that that

567
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,400
might be a driver.

568
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,720
Uh hi absolutely love your presentation.

569
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,200
I just had a question about uh the

570
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
causes of these addictions as we know

571
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,640
with a lot of addictions that childhood

572
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,120
trauma and childhood abuse and various

573
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,360
factors lead to addiction and I was just

574
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,440
curious to know if you factored that in

575
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,280
your computational analysis. Right. So

576
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,640
the benefit of looking at human tissues

577
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,799
is that you capture everything that

578
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,000
occurred in the lifetime. So some of the

579
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,320
things that we look at may be a direct

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,760
effect of opioid exposure and that's why

581
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,360
the brain DNA organization has changed,

582
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,159
but they could also be pre-existing

583
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,240
opioid exposure. So we're looking uh

584
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,880
currently we're starting exposing cells

585
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,440
on plastic to opioids and seeing what

586
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,280
changes in that very simplified system.

587
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,200
Um and what it looks like is in one of

588
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,480
our one of our brain cohorts that we've

589
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,799
studied in the frontal cortex. Um that

590
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,200
is where you see more signs of these

591
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,039
effects being early childhood adversity

592
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,360
related. So high stress in early

593
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,440
childhood can change the way in which

594
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,320
the brain is organized. The epigenetics

595
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,559
of the brain um and has pretty lasting

596
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,559
impacts and we see some evidence of that

597
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
here. So a postto who just started

598
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
that's looking at how the effects of

599
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,159
stress and early development may

600
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,600
influence response to opioids.

601
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,600
Awesome. Further questions. Yes.

602
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,000
Um hi thank you so much for your

603
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,679
presentation. My question was going to

604
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,200
be about uh data being biased. Uh is the

605
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,840
data gender biased? I think the data

606
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,840
that is coming from the past is most of

607
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,320
the time male dominated. Is it something

608
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,320
that we should be cautious about? Yes.

609
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,520
So we have most of the studies have been

610
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,159
published have like been cognizant of

611
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,760
gender differences of sex differences uh

612
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
because we're collecting X and Y

613
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,840
chromosome related information. We can

614
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,200
see that very clearly. It's in the

615
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,520
followup that you see the most

616
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,520
disparity. So which LOSI you're studying

617
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,960
mostly are studied in mice, right? It's

618
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,679
when we follow up on experiment and

619
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,440
that's mostly done in male mice. Uh but

620
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,080
the actual discovery is pretty well

621
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,039
balanced with some notable challenges.

622
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,200
So uh one of the strange challenges for

623
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,400
us is that it's hard to find accidental

624
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,480
death female controls. Um women tend to

625
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,480
die of chronic diseases and less likely

626
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,240
to draw um to die at a young age of an

627
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,159
um accidental death like a motorcycle

628
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,760
accident. Um and so that's it's a great

629
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,600
thing that we can't find enough controls

630
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
of accidental death, but it's also a

631
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,880
challenge. So we have to be very aware

632
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,720
of that so that we're not

633
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,880
misrepresenting in women with addiction

634
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,400
in the in the study. Great. And final

635
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,919
question. Um yeah, I'm a statistician so

636
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,360
forgive me if this is too naive a

637
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,159
question, but you said something very

638
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,559
interesting about complex traits. Um

639
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,559
namely that I'm assuming complex traits

640
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,240
here are the more the number of base

641
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,480
pair differences or something and or

642
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,320
combinations thereof. Uh and

643
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,799
interestingly those are also precisely

644
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,760
the traits which perhaps uh occur in

645
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,960
fewer people um like the more complex a

646
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,559
trait I'm assuming there are fewer

647
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,919
people in the population that have that

648
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,000
trait. It's inverse actually. Oh I see.

649
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,720
So the the more if there is a trait

650
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,440
that's caused by a single major effect,

651
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,799
it's more rare because that effect may

652
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,320
be selected against with uh evolutionary

653
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:52,000
pressures. But when it's complicated of

654
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,400
many different little causes, they can

655
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,840
live in our genomes for longer. So it's

656
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
actually the most common traits that are

657
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,840
the most polygenic or have the most

658
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,159
genetic factors that influence them.

659
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,159
Okay, that that's good to know. Okay,

660
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,159
thanks.
