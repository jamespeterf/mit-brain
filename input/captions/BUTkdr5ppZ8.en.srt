1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,640
Thank you for having me. Thank you to uh

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,120
the MIT Startup Exchange for hosting

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,760
this event. Um my name is Jamie New and

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,880
I am the co-founder and CEO of Podium

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,880
Automation. We are reimagining the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,039
design and manufacturing of industrial

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,119
control panels to create a more

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,920
resilient and modern industrial supply

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,240
chain. Our team brings decades of

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,960
experience from companies like Tesla,

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,599
Blue Origin, Walmart, and Bowie Farming

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,480
to ultimately reduce lead times of

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,200
critical equipment from months to days.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,520
Um, I am a Sloan grad. We also have a

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,520
couple of other MIT alumni on the

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
founding team.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
So, industrial control panels are a

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,920
critical component of every industrial

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,160
machine and electromechanical process.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640
Physically, it is a collection of

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
devices like PLC's, relays, and circuit

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,520
breakers inside an enclosure. Control

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
panels are extremely pervasive

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
throughout the built world from

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,239
infrastructure to largecale

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,479
manufacturing plants, wastewater

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,960
treatment, data centers, and everything

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,320
in between. Um, once you start noticing

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,159
them, you will see them everywhere.

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,840
Despite the central role control panels

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,880
have in automation, the current design

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,200
and build process is extremely manual.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,840
There is a long tale of thousands of

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
panel shops in the US alone that are

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
largely crafting panels by hand

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,640
resulting in long lead times um of 2 to

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,040
6 months for a single panel.

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,439
We have done a lot of listening in this

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
space and we believe that the new

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,560
generation of manufacturing companies

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,799
and leaders demand better and will need

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,240
better lead times in order to to meet

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,399
the sort of timelines that they're

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,040
looking for.

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,840
So what we are doing at podium is we are

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,640
combining proprietary software and

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,200
automation to build factories that

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,280
reduce lead time and increase margin for

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:05,119
custom industrial control panels

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,840
across the speed, quality um and cost

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,640
spectrum. We believe that customers

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,800
should not need to choose to and um our

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
goal is to build a low friction

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,080
experience for engineers and operators

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,400
to procure a control panel within days.

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:28,160
So we are currently UL508A certified. Um

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,000
we're also uh in process of UL698A

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,720
certification which is hazardous

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,560
locations and our current lead times are

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,959
less than four weeks per panel.

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,760
So, how do we actually do this? We have

62
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,840
created a seamless process to reduce

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,400
lead times across the quote design,

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,640
build, test, and delivery spectrum.

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
We've created a intake form for

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,120
customers and a process that allows us

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,680
to provide build quotes in less than 24

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
hours. Our internal software acts as a

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
co-pilot to an electrical engineer to

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,560
get to a full digital twin of the panel

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,040
itself, which ultimately unlocks

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
automation in the fabrication process in

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,360
our state-of-the-art factory and

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,760
facility.

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,239
And since our founding uh less than a

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,200
year ago, we have delivered over 30

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,599
projects across a varied customer base.

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,400
Recently, um, the case study highlighted

79
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,360
here, we completed four unique panel

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
builds for a Berkshire Hathaway owned

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
industrial filtration water equipment

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
company. We delivered those panels in

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,120
less than four weeks for a project where

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,120
the entire installation um was delayed

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,120
by the control panel showing up.

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,840
So, we have some incredible traction so

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,480
far, a team of seven currently full-time

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
employees, and we are in the uh midst of

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,959
expanding to a $20 million annual

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,840
capacity facility in the next couple of

91
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,599
months. Um, so alongside that expansion,

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
what we're looking for is corporate

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,000
partners to scale with us. From a

94
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,159
customer perspective, we work with OEMs

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
and end users across industries who

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,239
build or buy control panels today. We're

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
also looking for partners on the

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
component manufacturing side. So if you

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,360
are a manufacturer of components that go

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,320
into a control panel, Allah, a Seammens,

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,639
Honeywell, Schneider Electric, um we'd

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
love to chat as well about partnering on

103
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
the component database that we're

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,479
putting together.

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,120
Thank you and happy to answer any

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,120
questions.
