1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,120
so it's great to see everybody uh it's

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,640
unfortunate it seems like fall already

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,000
arrived here so it's

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,080
cloudy but the the river is beautiful I

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,160
hope you get a chance to go walk around

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,080
um I'm going to talk about what I'm

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,160
calling the this infinite Loop um it's

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,400
really this uh overall Journey that

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,880
we're in and trying to make medicines um

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,160
and for us we make molecules just right

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,039
right down the street right on the

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,320
campus of MIT and we try to do that

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,199
where we can make a 100 million

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,640
molecules and we can do that in a short

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,239
period of time

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,360
and the big question now is what do they

17
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,879
all do like can we actually start to

18
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,440
learn from those molecules so that we

19
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,600
can build machine learning models and

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,719
then eventually type in a computer and

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,719
really interact with it and not just

22
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,480
hallucinate ligans that we hear about

23
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,600
now with Alpha fold and so forth but

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,360
actually get drug molecules and the

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,320
other big part is of that is how do you

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
scale how do you actually manufacture

27
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,520
these molecules rapidly how do you get

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,920
into animal experiments and so we're

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
also building digital twins of machines

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,199
so that scientists can actually before

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
they actually go make the molecule you

32
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,240
can actually predict what's going to

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
happen with high confidence so hopefully

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,479
accelerate the pace in which we can

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,439
actually hopefully overcome some of

36
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,920
these medical challenges that we all

37
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,560
hear about or experience and so this is

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
the infinite Loop because it never ends

39
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,640
unfortunately we're never going to be

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,400
able to make the number of molecules uh

41
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,439
that are possible so that's 10 to the

42
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,600
power 60 or even greater if you speak to

43
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,400
a theoretician and so we're always going

44
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,960
to be in the cycle of trying to

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,960
understand how do the moleculars

46
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,560
molecules actually influence biology and

47
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,479
then go ahead and take that information

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
and iterate on that and so we just want

49
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,799
to use machine learning to do that in a

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,720
much faster uh way I'm also going to

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
show you that we're able to build

52
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,040
algorithms that actually do things that

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,439
humans can't and actually it translates

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,280
all the way at least into animal

55
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,280
experiments at this stage and so um this

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
is a project that emerged actually with

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,560
a collaborator uh right right down the

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,360
street uh syrea Therapeutics and so they

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,600
were one of the first companies to

60
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,200
create a medicine for a disease called

61
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,880
duchan muscular distrophy it's a disease

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
in young boys where there's essentially

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,120
still really no robust cure and

64
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,520
unfortunately they die eventually and so

65
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,160
we've been working on this at MIT for a

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,440
long time and a lot of roadblocks it's

67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,400
just simply a delivery Challenge and so

68
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,800
we asked the question once we ended up

69
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,360
getting enough data and understanding

70
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,080
what's going on can we actually start to

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,840
use deep learning to design molecules

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
that are actually potentially medicines

73
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,800
and so I'm going to walk you through

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
what we've learned so this devastating

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,879
disease du muscular distrophy it's a

76
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,519
genetic disease it actually ends up in

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,480
the case that their muscle cells don't

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,680
work properly and so in in our bodies

79
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,680
and humans we actually if you exercise

80
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,680
you have more muscle tissue and so forth

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
um in their case it doesn't even matter

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,120
if they exercise they have necrosis

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
breakdown of the tissue the muscle

84
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,040
tissue where it's overtaken by fat tisue

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,760
tissue unfortunately in their teenage

86
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,319
years they simply if your muscles don't

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,480
work properly you can't survive and they

88
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,519
unfortunately die and really no

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
treatments until recently and the

90
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,599
current treatments are are are not very

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,799
good they're not ready to really cure

92
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,519
this disease and so why does this

93
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,959
actually happen what's going on at the

94
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,920
genetic level as I mentioned it's in the

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,920
DNA it's a mutation in which they don't

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,760
actually end up making this protein

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
called disten it's one of the largest

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,319
proteins in our muscle cells in our

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,159
bodies it allows them to actually work

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,480
and so this protein is it doesn't

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,959
function correctly so it's been a major

102
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,799
challenge to figure out how do you

103
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,959
actually come up with a therapy or a

104
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,599
drug gene therapy is starting to look

105
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,040
promising and we're going to walk walk

106
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,959
through that here so you have this

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,560
faulty Gene and how how how do you

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,439
actually fix it so this is the first

109
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,640
molecule that came online from Serta

110
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,480
it's actually it's it's really

111
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,079
interesting it's it's it's painting a

112
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,239
picture which I think is really really

113
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,120
interesting

114
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,879
it's a molecule called a

115
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,159
phosphorodiamidate morpholino aliger and

116
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,560
I'm showing you a picture of it here and

117
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,439
it's inspired by the properties of DNA

118
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,920
and RNA but what chemists have done is

119
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,600
they've designed it so you actually

120
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,880
can't make it with biological systems

121
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,639
and they did that because they really

122
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,400
wanted to impart more drug-like features

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,560
they wanted to remove that phosphate

124
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,000
that's on the backbone that negative

125
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,320
charge so that it's not doesn't get

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,400
cleaved rapidly they also wanted to

127
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,000
stabil ized the structure so they went

128
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,560
ahead and changed the ribos ring so that

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,199
it actually had a a morpholino what's

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,199
neat here and why I really like this

131
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,080
this is the future of medicine it's

132
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,520
going to be completely artificial

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,080
biopolymers that are designed to have

134
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,440
really nonimmunogenic behavior and long

135
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,240
lasting and that's what they did here

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,360
the challenge is it's 10 kilon so it

137
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,280
faces a a delivery problem it simply

138
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,639
will not cross your membrane of these

139
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,240
muscle cells so we know it's a genetic

140
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,479
medicine if it actually gets into the

141
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,680
nucleus I'll show you it actually can

142
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,280
restore production of this protein by

143
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,320
splicing mechanism and ultimately allows

144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,479
these cells the function properly so I'm

145
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,360
showing you the dosing it's 50

146
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
milligrams per kilogram so this is a

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,840
Brute Force molecule that means you need

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,639
to give grams IV of infusion to really

149
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,160
get this molecule into those muscle

150
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,400
cells because it's large it doesn't

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,199
simply diffuse as we know small

152
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,600
molecules do right what I'm also showing

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,400
you here is that it actually works so

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
you actually if you can get it into

155
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,400
these uh tissues and then do

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,720
imunohistochemistry what I'm showing you

157
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,160
in green is someone that's actually

158
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,759
received this molecule and we're looking

159
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,360
for restoration of of that particular

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,280
protein so how can we actually improve

161
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,800
this how do we overcome this delivery

162
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,400
challenge so we said okay well let's

163
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,160
just look in the literature and ask the

164
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,600
question are there any off-the-shelf

165
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,479
Technologies or approaches that we at

166
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,960
MIT can just bring in our our our robots

167
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,120
and our Automation and make and try

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
everything just to really understand if

169
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,639
we can improve this property that we're

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
Desiring this delivery challenge so

171
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,240
there's a couple things that inspired us

172
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,840
one is that there's these materials that

173
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,759
are called cell penetrating peptides and

174
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,400
so we go ahead and attach them it's

175
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,840
written here as a CPP coant directly on

176
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,240
this anti-sense Olo so now this is in

177
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,160
the artart called a peptide pmo

178
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,240
conjugate these are actually an emerging

179
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,759
area of Medicine

180
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,960
and then we had an animal model it's

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,759
called the MDX Mouse and this actually

182
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,520
resembles what occurs in the DMD case

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,479
and what inspired is is that you can

184
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,160
actually modify this molecule and you

185
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,599
can go do an animal experiment first off

186
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
it doesn't die uh it's safe at least in

187
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,080
mice and moreover you can start to

188
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,000
restore levels of disten to the same

189
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,680
levels of a healthy animal as shown in

190
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,680
Red so that's looking for restoration um

191
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,080
of the particular uh protein um dis

192
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,520
so this is the challenge this is really

193
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,680
the unlock this is the case for mRNA

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,960
vaccines this is the case for any

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,759
genetic medicine it actually has to get

196
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,319
inside the cell right and so I'm showing

197
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,080
you how this works so in our case we're

198
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,360
going to take this peptide pmo it's

199
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,960
going to get endocytosed as I'm showing

200
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,319
here it has to release from that

201
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,960
biological barrier the endosome so it's

202
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,199
still inh housed within this vesicle and

203
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,919
then eventually even get into the

204
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,160
nucleus that's not as large of a

205
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,879
challenge and in the nucleus it's going

206
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,479
to actually carry out its function which

207
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,759
is going to alter the splicing

208
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,360
mechanisms at the MRNA level and

209
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,919
actually eventually allow you to get

210
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,240
this message RNA that will then produce

211
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,599
the protein so we're going to go ahead

212
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,319
and and look at this and understand if

213
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,520
we can improve this delivery Challenge

214
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,560
and we're doing it with a cell

215
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,520
penetrating peptide we're going to use

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,199
an engineered cell line this is one of

217
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,879
the gold standards to understand if

218
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,639
you're actually getting delivery and the

219
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,720
molecule is actually functional

220
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,879
the way it works we call this the egfp

221
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,720
splice correction uh cell and if we in

222
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,879
fact end up in the nucleus as I'm

223
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,240
showing you here we actually have a gene

224
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,199
for egfp that has a particular piece of

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,159
DNA in it that actually if we get

226
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,120
hybridization and the right splicing

227
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,159
we're going to turn on fluorescence so

228
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,120
it's a turn on assay so the cells are

229
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,479
more bright they're more green they are

230
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,960
the more they fluores that in theory

231
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,039
should be correlated with how well we

232
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,440
delivered this molecule into the cell so

233
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,120
we went ahead and made everything that

234
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,959
we could find in the literature we just

235
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,719
said we don't we we we want to actually

236
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,719
help solve this problem so we went ahead

237
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,360
and looked at over a hundred different

238
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,760
constructs we tested them all in this

239
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,600
assay and what I'm showing you is fold

240
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,640
change in fluorescence so a lot of those

241
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
black dots are actually close to zero so

242
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,720
they didn't have a large effect on

243
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,160
relative to this unmodified pmo to

244
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
whereas some of the winners actually

245
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,920
look like they're improving fluoresence

246
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,240
by 20 to 30 fold we thought perhaps we

247
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,519
had something to work with so you go

248
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,360
ahead and dive deep into this and we

249
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,800
learned that polyarginine so it's one of

250
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,640
your amino acids actually was the most

251
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,120
effective at delivering into the cell

252
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,200
the problem with this is from a chemist

253
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,920
perspective we didn't learn anything all

254
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,240
we learn is string together Arginine

255
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,440
residues the same amino acid and that

256
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,800
actually would give you higher

257
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,880
fluorescence now the problem the real

258
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,079
problem is that these polyart

259
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,279
compounds were discovered back in the

260
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,600
1980s and they've never helped solve the

261
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,360
delivery challenge because they're toxic

262
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,040
so what happened is they'll actually gum

263
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,920
up your kidney because they have this

264
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,440
positive charge on the side chain the

265
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,600
ion channels don't function properly and

266
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,720
they also cause Mass cell degranulation

267
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,079
so we had we really had nowhere to go

268
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,399
right we just put in years of work and

269
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:56,480
we we we didn't learn anything new um

270
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,000
we're still stuck and so we call this a

271
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,440
toxicity and SAR problem and so we said

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,640
okay how can we actually get out of this

273
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,040
local Minima so at this time we said

274
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,880
okay we're generating a lot of data we

275
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,600
think biologically we have some core

276
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,120
hypothesis of what we need to actually

277
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,959
go after is it time now for us to

278
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,279
actually use artificial intelligence to

279
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,760
do chemical Evolution right evolution of

280
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,519
drug molecules and what we need is we

281
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,040
need to build a data set as everyone

282
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,079
talks about we need to train a machine

283
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,160
learning model and you'll see we'll

284
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,560
connect it to an Optimizer and

285
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,040
essentially we're going to iterate over

286
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,040
and over again in a computer and then

287
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,519
eventually in the laboratory and the

288
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,160
hope is is that we're going to actually

289
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,760
have molecules that work better than

290
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,160
anything we could have ever designed at

291
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,240
MIT or even at syto

292
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,880
Therapeutics so as I mentioned we always

293
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,680
going to have a data problem so when you

294
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,160
go to do these types of experiments you

295
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,639
need a biological hypothesis that allows

296
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,200
you to establish your data your key

297
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,800
learning so you train a machine learning

298
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,519
model that actually makes sense so over

299
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,920
the years we made one real key

300
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,880
observation

301
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,480
the observation was is that we shouldn't

302
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,880
think about these cell penetrating

303
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,639
peptides in terms of their individual

304
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,440
amino acids but rather as modules and

305
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,839
that if we bring these modules together

306
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,839
they should function

307
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,959
synergistically in other words if you

308
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,959
take one construct and you measure its

309
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:21,240
full change in this assay as I'm showing

310
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:23,600
you there the pvec molecule shown in red

311
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,040
very uh small effect in terms of

312
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,839
delivery from that egfp assay if I take

313
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,440
another variant called bpep and I study

314
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,040
that okay it has a little bit of a

315
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,200
better a stronger effect but the key is

316
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,079
that when we cently fuse them together

317
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,079
to make this new cell penetrating muy

318
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,000
actually is not simply additive there's

319
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,720
a multiplier and we call that

320
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,360
synergistic so now the hypothesis is we

321
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,200
need to unlock this overall challenge by

322
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,760
bringing together these modules the

323
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,440
modules that favor endosomal release

324
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,959
association with membranes nuclear

325
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,959
localization and in some combinatoric

326
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,760
fashion we could perhaps have high

327
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:05,880
efficient delivery and so we went ahead

328
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,920
and made over 600 different designs and

329
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,839
we asked the question from this cell

330
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,399
assay what actually happens do we see

331
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,440
anything that works quite well so 600

332
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,040
different data points you can run this

333
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,480
even on what's called a high throughput

334
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,800
fax experiment so an overnight robot

335
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,839
will run all these egfp sell assays for

336
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,880
you the next day you'll be plotting out

337
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,040
your data and this is what you see you

338
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,839
see a fair spread of constructs actually

339
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,120
um worked okay right 10-fold Improvement

340
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:38,079
of fluorescence and others had zero

341
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
improvement over just unmodified pmo and

342
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,839
a few of them a number of them had

343
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,760
increase activity up to 20 fold so now

344
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,279
in this new world actually and I would

345
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,160
have never have done this in graduate

346
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,920
school 20 years ago um you actually

347
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,040
asked the question will this data be

348
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,720
powerful enough to actually predict what

349
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,160
would have happened in that cell assay

350
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,160
right and so we went ahead and buil a

351
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,079
machine learning model based on those

352
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,639
600 data points all from same conditions

353
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,480
in a Cell assay and then we built what's

354
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,120
called a Triad so we connected the

355
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,199
overall machine learning model that

356
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,839
predicts activity to a generator the

357
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,720
generator scrubed the entire universe of

358
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,320
everything we know about peptides that

359
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,880
may help

360
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,959
permeation and moreover we actually used

361
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,639
some of the key things that we learn to

362
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,279
actually build into this generator like

363
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,120
immunogenicity and other things that you

364
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,560
care about when you make a drug

365
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,720
molecule and lastly we connected it to a

366
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,920
genetic algorithm called an Optimizer in

367
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,560
our case and what that did is that

368
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,360
penalized any of the sequences that

369
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,000
proved to be high activity but say

370
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,360
strings of arginine right we penalized

371
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,760
it if it was very long sequence if it

372
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,680
didn't look like it was going to be

373
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,199
soluble and so forth and now the

374
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,959
computer just runs continuously it can

375
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,360
understand molecules we did Morgan

376
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,079
fingerprints to do this and eventually

377
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,360
it predicts sequences and this is why in

378
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:01,880
uate school we would work with

379
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,880
computational people and they would come

380
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,839
to us and ask us to make molecules for

381
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,920
them and we would say okay well if I

382
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,360
make that it's going to take a year of

383
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,120
my life how confident are you it's going

384
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,680
to work they're like not very confident

385
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,440
that's why this has all changed is

386
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,079
because we have all these tools now to

387
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,360
really get confident in the molecules

388
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,199
that computers predict and go actually

389
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,320
make them in the laboratory so computers

390
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,279
can understand molecules you have to do

391
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,600
that with a fingerprinting technology

392
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,199
which is called Morgan fingerprints and

393
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,920
essentially you're barcoding each

394
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,600
molecule as you design and then for our

395
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,440
case it's a polymer so you string them

396
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,959
together and you essentially get what

397
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,279
looks like a QR code right and so this

398
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,440
is the fingerprinting of molecules and

399
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,360
it can even be non-natural amino acids

400
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,639
as I'm showing you so that's how the

401
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,199
computer algorithm work through all

402
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,759
these various pieces of data and

403
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:52,680
actually built this model so it actually

404
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,440
uh predicts many many sequences more

405
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,320
than you can possibly make there

406
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,399
sequences you can't find anywhere here

407
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,079
on Earth in any of the databases they're

408
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,279
built from even even non-natural amino

409
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,880
acids they even come out circular and so

410
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,800
forth and so another challenge is you

411
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,920
got to go make and test some of them are

412
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,120
9.3 kilodalton so 93 amino acids or so

413
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,320
we refer to them as these mock proteins

414
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,880
so machine learning derived many

415
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,480
proteins and we went ahead and go went

416
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,000
and made a batch of them and asked the

417
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,800
question do they actually really work so

418
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,360
the ne thing here is we've actually as I

419
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,079
mentioned built machines that can

420
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,560
rapidly make molecules in this case we

421
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,920
could make these machine learning

422
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,399
derived many proteins in 15 minutes on

423
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,399
these robots that we have it's the

424
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,120
world's fastest machine to make peptides

425
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,160
and proteins and the way it works is you

426
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,720
literally um charge these instruments

427
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,600
usually on a weekly basis and students

428
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,600
and postdocs will type in these

429
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,319
sequences and the Machine will just run

430
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,079
through it you can even make proteins or

431
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,240
machine learning derived constructs um

432
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,279
and so we went ahead and and did that um

433
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,480
and tested a handful of them and lo and

434
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,519
behold the highest performing sequence

435
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,560
that we've ever discovered actually were

436
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,399
discovered with this approach they're

437
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,160
showing in the red box so up to 50-fold

438
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,920
Greater Improvement in that cell assay

439
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,639
better than anything that was originally

440
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,959
tested better than anything that was in

441
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,680
the data set alone and so we're quite

442
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,920
excited about this perhaps you can get

443
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,319
out of these local Minima that we're in

444
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,720
and really design things that at least

445
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:24,839
will teach you new aspects of delivery

446
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,639
so why is it that the algorithm actually

447
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,920
liked particular sequences over others

448
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,279
so this is a what's called a great

449
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,680
radiant activation map what we're doing

450
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,560
is we're color color coding the yellow

451
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,399
uh monomers or pieces of this polymer

452
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,720
that the algorithm thought was most

453
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,120
activating it turns out that it's

454
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,639
actually even non-natural amino acids so

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,600
variance that nature has really never

456
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,279
seen before that's an aminohexanoic acid

457
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,560
why do I show this is because it's not a

458
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,399
a Guess Game for us we can look at this

459
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,000
information then we can go understand

460
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,560
why we can do structural activity

461
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,800
relationship studies change that amino

462
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,759
acid and figure out why is it that it

463
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,319
turned out to be so

464
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,959
important so now we dive deeper we say

465
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,480
we're going to go do animal experiments

466
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,439
from these compounds that were U

467
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,600
discovered with this approach so we do

468
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,559
titrations make sure that they actually

469
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,000
make sense at the cell assay so do a

470
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,760
bunch of different concentrations I'm

471
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,199
showing you that on the left uh plot and

472
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,919
then on the right plot we're asking are

473
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,799
these toxic is it just that we're

474
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,240
permeabilizing the outer membrane and

475
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,319
that's why is you getting better

476
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,440
delivery and so you see a wide

477
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,240
difference in concentrations between a

478
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,919
toxicity and a function and so this is

479
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,160
how we move forward into an animal

480
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,720
experiment so the last big question

481
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,559
you're probably asking me why did we

482
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,760
pick this uh egfp assay turns out

483
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,400
there's an egfp animal so I can

484
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,000
translate and this is the case for

485
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,720
genetic medicines if you solved the

486
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,280
delivery problem you can translate what

487
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,360
you learn in the cell all the way to the

488
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,080
animal and so in this animal it actually

489
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,559
every organ has that same same egfp

490
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,760
construct so we can do a simple tail

491
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,520
vein injection we can wait seven days in

492
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,600
this case extract the organs you can

493
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,480
measure the amount of pmo present and

494
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,720
the amount of egfp and you can start to

495
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,760
understand biodistributions how well are

496
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,240
these molecules getting into these cells

497
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,360
and so forth and you can use this as a

498
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,440
whole another tool for

499
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,000
optimization so we went ahead and took

500
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,559
these constructs did a number of dosing

501
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,919
and actually took out the the tissues

502
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,200
that we care about for DMD quadriceps

503
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,559
diaphragm and heart and actually they

504
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,280
work right they work some of them um at

505
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,640
you know 30 migs per kig and even less

506
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,600
and so um we didn't fully predict that

507
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,280
this would actually translate fully but

508
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,240
in some ways that's why we ended up with

509
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,000
vaccines right from mRNA and the

510
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,200
shortest possible time anyone's ever

511
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,760
made anything that went into a human

512
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,360
it's because the genetic medicines with

513
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,640
solving the delivery problem really do

514
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,960
in fact work so we live in a new space

515
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,520
we do this for many projects all the way

516
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,440
from Li and design and Discovery all the

517
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,240
way into delivery and as I said when we

518
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,320
manufacture molecules even before

519
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,880
synthesis we take these types of

520
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,240
approaches and so from a discovery

521
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,799
perspective we make sure we have a key

522
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,480
biological hypothesis in our case it was

523
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:25,880
working with a modular library and then

524
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,760
that doesn't uh make us um in this data

525
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,200
limiting problem uh we need quantitative

526
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,080
biological assays and then we need to

527
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,440
understand what kind of machine learning

528
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,760
um are we going to use this changes so

529
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,880
fast even in the Sciences um you know

530
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,960
there's probably a thousand papers about

531
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,880
how to update a machine learning model

532
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,400
every single day now and then we

533
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,919
connected to these Optimizer and triad

534
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,240
systems to really make sure the

535
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,880
molecules that come out are worth going

536
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,320
to spend time in the laboratory and then

537
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,480
Chase all the way to the animal

538
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,720
experiment and I would say using this

539
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,559
approach we've now um cracked the one

540
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,200
Mig per kig injection at animals so

541
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,640
really the most potent molecule we've

542
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,760
ever discovered is advancing in even

543
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,000
into non-human primates using using this

544
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,480
approach so it's a lot of fun and uh

545
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,720
thank you for hearing about one of the

546
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,880
projects we have at

547
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:21,840
[Applause]

548
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,200
MIT thank you so much um we do have time

549
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,559
for questions um if anyone we're just

550
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,720
going to do it the oldfashioned way

551
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,720
raise your hand and I'll hand you the

552
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,679
mic any questions for

553
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,159
Brad thank you fantastic talk so how

554
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:41,000
about we we bring in new modalities like

555
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,360
positive liid particles into the CPP so

556
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,520
we can use machine learning and

557
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,679
automatic synesis pipelines to bridge

558
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,000
the two modality together yeah yeah

559
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,480
absolutely so I usually have a group

560
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,880
photo at this at the end if you could

561
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,880
flash it on there because I I just want

562
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,799
to show you a picture of my group

563
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
they're great I had like a hundred other

564
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
slides so I couldn't make it all the way

565
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,720
to that

566
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,720
but um along those lines yeah so we

567
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,919
basically on that machine I showed you

568
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,600
right you can program in lipidated amino

569
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,799
acids you can program in lipidated

570
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,559
proteins you could even make Polymers of

571
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,120
lipids so um essentially um being able

572
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,600
to rapidly make molecules in an

573
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,640
automated format is in many ways if it's

574
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,039
around polyamid synthesis or even some

575
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,799
lipid chemistry you can do what you just

576
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,400
ask and you can actually build machine

577
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,000
learning models you can do everything

578
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,720
I've just showed you but with completely

579
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,760
different approach yeah so

580
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,919
absolutely yeah this is the the group

581
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,679
these are all the people that do the

582
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,679
wonderful work

583
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,000
so thanks Brad great talk so it's

584
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,440
interesting now to see you're moving

585
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,799
into nhps to see if if there's any

586
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,440
potential toxicity but in parallel what

587
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,080
about M GMP manufacturing of some of

588
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,080
these um peptide constructs yeah um so I

589
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,880
you know one thing that we do at MIT

590
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
professors students and posts is we

591
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,640
actually end up launching a lot of

592
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,360
companies

593
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,120
so I do have a company called Amit

594
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,080
Technologies which is are building the

595
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,919
the robots in a GMP environment and so

596
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,360
they they will be made under GMP

597
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,799
conditions absolutely um and you know

598
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,679
it's not you know the peptide

599
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:18,320
manufacturing has been around for GMP

600
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,320
for a long time but yeah certainly yeah
