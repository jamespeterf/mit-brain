7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,760
And today, the tricky but vital task of

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,080
decarbonizing all sorts of hidden

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,480
processes, things you probably never

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,560
think about. So, not the flashy stuff

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,279
like cars and airplanes, which are the

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,960
polluters we worry a lot about and talk

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,040
a lot about, but there's all these

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
hidden things that are around us that

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,760
are the stuff that makes up our world,

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,920
that make up the food we eat, the

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,079
pharmaceuticals we make, the chemicals

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,879
and materials that are around us, the

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,160
materials we use to build our built

20
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,280
world, those are also extraordinarily

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,520
carbonintensive. They lead to huge

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
amount of emissions that arise from the

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
production of those materials. That's

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,480
Yogi Serendronath, a professor of

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,480
chemistry and chemical engineering at

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,799
MIT. And he says, take something like

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,640
steel, which is probably an integral

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
part of most offices that you've worked

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,680
in or most schools that you've attended.

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
We make enormous quantities of steel

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
around the world. We build literally

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,080
skyscrapers with steel. Every single

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
atom in that steel corresponds to a

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,960
certain number of molecules of CO2 that

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
were emitted to make that. So as

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
buildings get taller and people

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,200
increasingly move from the countryside

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,400
to the city, we have to figure out how

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,840
do we accommodate all these people and

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,799
get rid of or reduce the carbonintensive

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,439
processes used to make steel. But if

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,400
that seems like a big problem, consider

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,479
what you ate today. very likely it

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,640
benefited from a process called habber

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,280
bosch which is named after two German

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,200
chemists and for about the last century

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,159
it has been helping to create huge

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,640
amounts of fertilizer fertilizer that

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,439
makes farmland around the world much

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,560
more productive and that helps feed the

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,360
8 billion people on this planet if

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
you're chemically inclined here's yogi

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,319
giving a quick explanation of habber

54
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,400
bosch it's a process uh that's been

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,239
heavily optimize an industry. But the

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
crux of it is pretty simple at at least

57
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,480
at a at an atomistic level, which is

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
you're taking nitrogen from the air and

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,360
you're combining it with hydrogen that

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,120
you source from fossil fuels and you're

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
combining that nitrogen and hydrogen to

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
make ammonia. And ammonia is the key

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,680
component in most fertilizers. So even

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,760
in our bodies, there's food that we eat

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,760
that has a huge carbon footprint to it.

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,640
And and even in that that amount that

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,480
that value just making the ammonia we

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,160
use to grow all the food that we do in

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,560
the world that is already about a

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,800
percent a single percent of the entire

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,720
energy budget of the planet. So if we're

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
going to tackle climate change we have

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,080
to do something about the processes to

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,360
make steel and fertilizer and plastics

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
and concrete and on and on it goes.

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,720
Basically, it's all that stuff that

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
makes the world modern and which

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,400
generates something like a quarter of

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,680
our carbon dioxide emissions.

80
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,840
Industrialization emerged out of the

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,480
ready availability and the growth and

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,720
development of large ability to extract

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,319
fossil reserves of energy. So when we

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,200
were able to extract a large amount of

85
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,840
that fossil energy, it spawned a huge

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
paniply of industries underneath it that

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,280
used that energy storehouse, that sort

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,920
of historical geological storehouse of

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,000
energy and cashed out that energy to

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
make all the things that we have in the

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,519
stuff of our world, right? And to really

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,760
achieve deep decarbonization, we have to

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,840
not only do the decarbonization of, you

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,000
know, what turns on the lights, um, and

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
what heats our homes, uh, and what

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
powers our cars, but also all these

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,159
other industrial processes because they

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,720
make a huge fraction of the overall

99
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,439
carbon budget of the planet. But as you

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,599
can imagine, there are complications. So

101
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,760
go back to that haberbos process, which

102
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,560
provides us with so much fertilizer and

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,680
in turn provides us with so much food.

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,519
Yogi says, "We're awfully good at making

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,120
that fertilizer using fossil fuels. We

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,560
have over the better part of the last 60

107
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,600
or 80 years, really, really heavily

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,160
optimized how we make ammonia. So much

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
so that it caused many, many billions of

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,240
dollars, tens of billions in some cases,

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,320
to build a new ammonia plant. So much so

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
that the return on investment is

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,440
actually only after decades of sort of

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,000
time, right? Um, and so simply changing

115
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,400
that entire infrastructure to port in a

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
new chemical feed stock, new feed is is

117
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,280
not trivial. So scientists have a couple

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,360
of choices and neither of them is easy.

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,960
They can try to fiddle with existing

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
effective processes to make them more

121
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,240
fuel efficient or they can throw them

122
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
out and say, "Look, there is a better,

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
more sustainable way here. Let's do this

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,759
other thing." Here is Yogi in

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,120
conversation with me and Rob. But I'm

126
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,440
not presenting any of this to say that

127
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
it's it's daunting. It it's it's just to

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
say that that we need to be cognizant of

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
the fact that there's still a lot of new

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,039
science and new technology that needs to

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,840
be developed to to fully appreciate what

132
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,759
it means to for lack of a better term

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,680
transform a large portion of our

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,520
industrial sector, right? That's not

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
going to happen overnight. and and just

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,680
like our current industrial sector

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,919
really developed over many many decades

138
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,880
of development with fossil fuels as the

139
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,400
input, there's going to be years and

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,560
decades of development to be able to

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,440
transition that, right? Um but if you

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
look at for example how far we've come

143
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,919
in even just the primary generation of

144
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,800
renewable electricity in the context of

145
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,680
solar and wind, if you had looked a

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,400
decade earlier or 15 years earlier, that

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
too would have seemed daunting.

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,759
Right? And if you if you think about

149
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,960
where we are in just let's take just one

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
technology that's going to be really

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,720
really enabling for the future which is

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,960
just water electrolysis splitting water

153
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,960
into hydrogen and oxygen. And of course

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,880
there are huge and we work on a lot of

155
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
this in our own lab technological

156
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
advancements that need to be made to be

157
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,639
able to take those technologies to

158
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,520
scale. But that mountain we have to

159
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,759
climb there is kind of on the order of

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,800
the type of mountain we climbed over the

161
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,960
last 15 years when it came to the cost

162
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
of solar and the scale at which we've

163
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,720
built out solar. And that doesn't mean

164
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,479
there aren't still many challenges to

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,319
climb, but I am very optimistic that we

166
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,680
will wheel to get there. I have a

167
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,759
another question kind of for both of you

168
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,039
because it's kind of like a

169
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,560
science/policy question. You know, we're

170
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,240
talking about this mountain to climb and

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,800
you were saying like solar and wind,

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,400
they they really have climbed a lot of

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,520
it over the last 10 or 15 years. Is this

174
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,400
switch to um using chemical processes

175
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,319
that are greener that don't as emit as

176
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,639
much CO2? Is this mostly an issue of we

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,639
know the chemistry, we just don't have

178
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,160
the money or we don't really know the

179
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,199
chemistry, but people are willing to

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
cough up the money. You know what I

181
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,599
mean? Is this like a policy thing or

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,199
like a resource thing or is this like we

183
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,280
haven't figured it out in the lab yet?

184
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,039
We'll let you know. I think it comes

185
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,840
back to in part what Yogi was saying

186
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,160
before about this the scale of these

187
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,599
these industrial processes and the

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
degree of optimization that we've

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,319
brought to them and how replacing them

190
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
with an alternative that we can we can

191
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,880
imagine and maybe we can even practice

192
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,840
that has different economics maybe

193
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,080
inferior economics means we make food

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,919
more expensive or we make building

195
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,560
materials more expensive we change the

196
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,280
economics of other parts of the economy

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
and well there's disruption and and you

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
know that's I would say that there there

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,199
is absolutely you know huge

200
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
macroeconomic consequences to these

201
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
transitions right um but I would just

202
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,400
say on the technical side you know I

203
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
think that there's a a little bit of a a

204
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
view that things you do in the lab and

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,639
then when they get out of the lab with

206
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,960
enough resources they can then go to

207
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,759
scale and and in fact that's really not

208
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,919
how most technology development happens

209
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,199
um uh because what really happens is you

210
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,280
know what you're really doing in the

211
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,240
laboratory is sort of setting the

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,840
foundation

213
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,560
It it's sort of charting a map. The more

214
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,319
more fine grain that map is, the faster

215
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
you'll be able to get to scale, the more

216
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
in other words, the more you know of the

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,120
lay of the land of the problems you're

218
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,800
going to foresee at scale. And how you

219
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,039
might be able to avert those is going to

220
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,280
allow you to cross that hurdle faster.

221
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,400
That's the importance of basic research

222
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,800
even when there's this sort of push to

223
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,640
run run as fast as we can. Because if

224
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,479
you run run as fast as you can without a

225
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,279
really good map, you might find that

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,680
after you're a billion dollars in and

227
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,360
halfway towards your first pilot plant

228
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,800
that you might have a real problem that

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
you don't know how to solve. Right?

230
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,120
That's why it's really important to make

231
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,880
the foundation as solid as you can while

232
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,720
we are simultaneously trying to build

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,399
with what we already know. The scale of

234
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
these things though, the amount of money

235
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,200
and the level of risk also means that I

236
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
think it's very hard for the private

237
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,959
sector to get us there alone. People

238
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,360
aren't willing to put billions of

239
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,800
dollars into a process that may or may

240
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,160
not work. I mean, you want to you're

241
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,080
going to borrow that money from a bank.

242
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,240
You want it to work. Governments have to

243
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,640
be part of it.

244
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,200
I think that the points that both of you

245
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,720
have made bring up this kind of

246
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,560
interesting tension. I don't know how

247
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
either of you think about it. One is

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,240
we're in this race. We've got to very

249
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,680
quickly try to limit, you know, how much

250
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,120
the temperature is is raised worldwide.

251
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
But then on the other hand, as you say,

252
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,920
when you think about plastics or

253
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,399
fertilizer or steel production, those

254
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,080
things didn't happen in like a month or

255
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
a year. You know, for a long time,

256
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
people have been thinking, well, you

257
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
could make plastics a little bit better

258
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
this way. You know, this doesn't work so

259
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,839
well. Let's tweak it. And and

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,000
fertilizer, too. And and to a point

261
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,880
where the the production of these things

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,200
are so good and so rock solid that

263
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
people might be a little reluctant to be

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
like, well, here's a totally new

265
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,360
process. I know you've totally got this

266
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
down, but let's do something else. But

267
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,040
you have this tension of like, we have

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,040
got to move really fast, but the other

269
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,440
processes got good because what they had

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,600
on their side is time. I don't know how

271
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
you reconcile those two things, but they

272
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
seem to be in a little bit of tension

273
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,279
because we kind of don't have time.

274
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,600
You've hit the an important nail on the

275
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,279
head. It's it's it's a very very

276
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,760
critical piece, right? And and I would

277
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,839
say it's a little even more than just

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,600
time, and you hinted upon this. It's

279
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,040
it's it's just a a fear of the

280
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,360
unfamiliar. I I can just make it make

281
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,680
the statement even from a almost human

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,600
capital standpoint, right? A lot of the

283
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,519
processes we think about that are going

284
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
to be really important for these

285
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,640
decarbonization goals that use

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
electricity to drive some of these

287
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,480
processes, they revolve around this

288
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,560
field that we're part of that's known as

289
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,360
electrochemistry. Now if you think about

290
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,200
it that field actually there aren't many

291
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,200
people who know a lot about that who

292
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
populate the chemical industries the

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,279
Exxon Mobile the Dows the duons they're

294
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,519
not and the reason is historically when

295
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,760
you had a large amount of fossil fuels

296
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,040
that was your raw material you didn't

297
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,519
need to use the economic incentive what

298
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,600
was the economics to hire someone who

299
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,360
was trying to do a process that you

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,240
would only do if you wanted to

301
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,839
decarbonize the process Yet now many of

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
these companies are looking around and

303
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,240
saying, "Gee, we might want to do this,

304
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,360
but I don't know how to develop this

305
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,120
in-house cuz I don't even have the

306
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,959
people that have expertise in this

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,160
area." Electrochemistry has not always

308
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,440
been cool.

309
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,959
It's, you know, now you're at the

310
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,399
epicenter of chemistry. I I joke about

311
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,360
it. I mean, I think that that, you know,

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,959
in many ways, you know, the modern era,

313
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
and we actually already see this in, you

314
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,240
know, the the the cell phones we carry

315
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,920
around, right? In many respects, this

316
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
century will be the century in which

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,839
that field will play such a central role

318
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,240
in addressing some of these problems.

319
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,720
But it has not historically been the

320
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,480
place where we have trained a lot of our

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,839
best and brightest and encouraged our

322
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,079
best and brightest to go and use this as

323
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
an enabling science for them to impact

324
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,800
the world. And I shouldn't say because

325
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,360
it'll go to his head, but I mean Yogi

326
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,680
really truly is one of the young leaders

327
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
in this very very important resurgence

328
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,920
of electrochemistry. And it's our way

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,360
out of trouble in in so many areas. What

330
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,959
do I mean how do you think about this

331
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,480
tension of like moving fast versus what

332
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,720
Yogi was saying of like well there's

333
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
like we have to refine these things.

334
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
Well, we're not going to switch off what

335
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,839
we have now overnight and we may even

336
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,240
need to intervene in ways that will only

337
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,000
be temporary with with measures like

338
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,120
carbon capture and sequestration. you

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,320
know, just keep doing these these these

340
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,399
processes that produce CO2, but capture

341
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,959
it. We'll we'll we'll continue producing

342
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,560
this way and and putting it into the

343
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,839
ground. There's a limit in how far we

344
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,639
can go and hopefully new processes will

345
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
become viable and competitive and we'll

346
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,399
we'll get there and a transition will

347
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,560
occur. And again, government has to be

348
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
part of it. Big companies are watching.

349
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,839
They're they're watching, but they're

350
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,519
not doing yet. you know, they're just on

351
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,120
the edges of the playing field. And and

352
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
that other piece is another piece that

353
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
is important, right? Is that a lot of

354
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,279
this has a lot to do with the fact that

355
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
there is sunk capital, right? You know,

356
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,079
if you think about someone who is an

357
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,480
ammonia producer that makes fertilizer,

358
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,320
you know, they've already spent billions

359
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
of dollars of capital to build that

360
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,639
plant, right? Right. And they may not

361
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,480
have even gotten a return on investment

362
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,279
on that depending upon when that has

363
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,360
been constructed. So asking them to okay

364
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,519
you know completely re-engineer that

365
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,279
plan or completely scrap it and do

366
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,360
something completely different is a very

367
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,360
very big ask given that sort of stranded

368
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,600
capital that's already there in that

369
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,760
process right and I think that's another

370
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,880
place where government and policy can

371
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,440
play a strong role to better incentivize

372
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,639
how you deal with the the sort of

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,399
inherent um if you will like head start

374
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,560
the legacy processes have simply because

375
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,480
they've already have all that invested

376
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,000
amount of capital in them. And we've

377
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,360
talked about that before on the show,

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,839
right? Like I think you talked about,

379
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,639
you know, if a coal fired power plant's

380
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,800
being opened in China, yeah, somebody

381
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,120
has, let's say, like a mortgage or

382
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,760
whatever on that and it it they'll be

383
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,959
fine if it's open for 30 years, but the

384
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,480
government or somebody's going to have

385
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,839
to come in and say, "Let me help you

386
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,560
out." because otherwise you're just

387
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,480
really in huge heap of trouble if like

388
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,760
we only let you run this for seven years

389
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,760
and then we're like no we're shutting it

390
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,199
down sorry you can't use it anymore to

391
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
make money. So this introduces another

392
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,079
very important aspect of of the of the

393
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,199
transition and that is to what degree

394
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,519
can we reuse existing facilities

395
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,120
repurpose them. You know maybe replace

396
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,680
part of the harbor bosch process with an

397
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,240
electrified stage. uh or the other big

398
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,639
process in in in thermmochemistry, the

399
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,399
fisser tropes process, which is the

400
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,760
thing you use to make carbon monoxide

401
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,480
and hydrogen into hydrocarbons, sort of

402
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,639
fuels. Fuels. Exactly. Right. But I will

403
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,440
say one other key thing that's a piece

404
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,079
that's throughout all of this is that

405
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,399
you know if I go and take a fossil fuel

406
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,720
and I use it to power a plant whether

407
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,440
it's fish or tropes or it's you know

408
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,240
habbos to make ammonia one of the things

409
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,079
that actually makes it easier to run

410
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,079
those at large scale is that they can

411
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:28,639
run 24/7 at the exact same rate at the

412
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,720
exact same amount of product I'm making

413
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,079
which means that running them in that

414
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,839
stable consist consistent way is a

415
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,920
something that makes those processes

416
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,320
more efficient actually and that's how

417
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,920
they are right now right now the problem

418
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,199
though is wind and solar are

419
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,399
intermittent right that means that when

420
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,720
I use wind and solar to power whether

421
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,959
it's even making hydrogen or directly

422
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,240
electrifying these processes I need to

423
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,480
deal with the fact that I'm going to

424
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,880
maybe have

425
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,560
fluctuations in what my fuel is the fuel

426
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,560
content um or the power content. If I,

427
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,639
for example, have a habbos plant that

428
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm going to feed in hydrogen, well, the

429
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
hydrogen may be produced to some

430
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
intermittent level. And then if I need

431
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,040
to use electricity to power the heat,

432
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,040
well, that also may be intermittent. If

433
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,320
I'm not going to source it from fossil

434
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
fuel combustion, which means I haven't

435
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,720
done anything. And you're not going to

436
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
run your Fisher Tropes plant on

437
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
batteries. Exactly. So, so that's that's

438
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,560
the thing. We're not going to make a

439
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,959
bank of batteries just to make our Herb

440
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,800
Bosch plant run its stable operation,

441
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,480
right? That's a whole another

442
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,800
infrastructure layer that has to be

443
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,279
added to it. So, so, so this is why I

444
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,040
think things that may seem like drop in

445
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,759
changes still require a lot of

446
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,120
innovation around them, right? Yeah. I

447
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,639
is anyone really doing that level of

448
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,279
innovation at the sort of integration

449
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:54,880
level reimagining not parts of processes

450
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,040
but the whole thing and and trying to

451
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,440
build green facilities that do these

452
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
things economically as as demonstrators

453
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,400
to my knowledge relatively little at

454
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,679
this stage right be like trying to make

455
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,120
fertilizer right is that what you're

456
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,120
saying well well or I imagine trying to

457
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,199
make fertilizer in a green way that can

458
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,360
operate on an intermittent supply of the

459
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,039
energy or the fuel because that's what

460
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,880
it really would need to be down the

461
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,520
line, right? That's a pretty heavy lift.

462
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,679
Yeah. Because one reason is if if you

463
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,280
have to stop making when the sun sets,

464
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,799
your your billion-dollar plant is

465
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,039
sitting there doing nothing for half of

466
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,520
the time. And and it's even more than

467
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,640
that. A lot of times the catalysts, the

468
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,480
things that make the balls go downhill

469
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,679
faster, they work the best when they

470
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,280
have really pure inputs, really pure

471
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,440
outputs, and they're running at the

472
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,520
exact same rate all the time. But is

473
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,120
there something in between a completely

474
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
green plant and the way that we do

475
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,039
things now? Is there nothing that's like

476
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,520
at 50%. You know, do you know what I

477
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,840
mean? like where maybe you've altered

478
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,400
the chemistry in a way, you know, you

479
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,799
don't have to put as much energy into

480
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,640
it, but maybe at night time it does run

481
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,400
on fossil fuels because like, okay, the

482
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,799
sun's not shining. So, well, I guess I'd

483
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,200
point out, you know, solar power and

484
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,760
wind aren't the only clean options at

485
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,600
our disposal. We have nuclear power.

486
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
That's true, too. Which produces both

487
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,240
electricity and heat. And I think so

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,919
stably and very stably, they want to run

489
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,000
24/7. I think one of the really

490
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,840
interesting developments in nuclear

491
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
power that still hasn't really come to

492
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,520
market but will is is the development of

493
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,720
small modular reactors that can be sized

494
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,799
for industrial campuses like refineries

495
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,760
or Fisher Tropes plants or Harabash

496
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,440
plants and produce exactly the right

497
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,520
amount of heat and exactly the right

498
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,679
amount of electricity for a partially

499
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,039
electrified process. And and I think

500
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,720
we're going to see some demonstrations

501
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,559
of these things over the next several

502
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,960
years as well. Again, in part thanks to

503
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,559
that bipartisan infrastructure law. What

504
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,799
is coming to my mind is that, you know,

505
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,240
it's so important for us to have a grid.

506
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,400
We've talked about the sun setting and

507
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
rising and the wind not blowing nuclear

508
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,720
power plants, but we have a grid and the

509
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,160
grid does provide a constant source of

510
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,760
electricity because we have a diversity

511
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,640
of loads and not all on at the same

512
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,200
time. And so in electrifying

513
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,520
industry, developing that grid and and

514
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,679
continuing to invest in a diversity of

515
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,520
supply and transmission lines that move

516
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,840
power around the country and keep the

517
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,240
grid stable with a growing percentage of

518
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,039
renewable power is extremely important.

519
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,559
So electrochemistry and grid development

520
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,160
go hand in hand here. And the other

521
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,240
thing I would say that's actually really

522
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,960
important to bear in mind is that if you

523
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,799
take all the primary electricity needs

524
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,799
we have right now, right? And you just

525
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,720
take okay, what's that total amount and

526
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,480
you ask how much electricity do we need

527
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,080
to generate? if we're also going to use

528
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,000
electricity rather than fossil fuels to

529
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,280
decarbonize all this industry because

530
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,640
that's a significant fraction of the

531
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
carbon budget. It means we're going to

532
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,640
have to generate a lot more electricity

533
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,240
from solar and wind which means that

534
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,240
it's not just a question of upgrading

535
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,559
our grid to be able to make it stable

536
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,120
with intermittent supply. It also needs

537
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,760
to have capacity expansion, right?

538
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,919
Because now I have a massive sink of

539
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,720
electricity which is my refinery which

540
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,039
before wasn't that much of a sink of

541
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,080
electricity power because it was using

542
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:19,120
fossil fuels to power right so you don't

543
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,640
want your habash plant and its desire to

544
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,960
run stably to cause intermittency in the

545
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,200
energy supply to customers right there.

546
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,760
That is another layer that really

547
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,600
impacts on how critical it is for our

548
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,280
ability to move electricity between

549
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,039
places very very efficiently, right? And

550
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
and and our current infrastructure is

551
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,760
not by any means ready to tolerate um

552
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,679
what we would need to to get to uh for

553
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,120
for industrial and it's worth thinking

554
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,559
about what that infrastructure looks

555
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,400
like. I mean, we're talking about

556
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,159
industrial process electrification here,

557
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,159
but at the same time, we're electrifying

558
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,080
cars. We're trying to electrify the

559
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,520
heating of our homes. We're building

560
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,880
data centers all over the place that are

561
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,880
consuming enormous amounts of

562
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,640
electricities. In fact, they're

563
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
consuming pretty much all of the new

564
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,360
renewable electricity. For a while, we'd

565
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,840
kind of seen, you know, the electricity

566
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,919
demand level off and then AI came along

567
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,960
and like all bets were off and it's

568
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,640
going to get worse and we're going to

569
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,559
produce hydrogen from the grid. It's

570
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,600
huge. I can't I just heard like when you

571
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,760
do a query for like ChachiPT, how much

572
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,840
electricity use, but it's

573
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,679
enor Google searches. It's just the

574
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,600
scale is huge and when you think about

575
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,440
more and more people using that kind of

576
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,280
stuff all the time, it's it's a lot. So,

577
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,159
I won't say you can't get there using

578
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,640
just solar and wind, but you'll really

579
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,159
notice the solar and wind if we if we're

580
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,080
going to increase capacity to that

581
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,000
degree. It will be everywhere. And and

582
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,039
this is why, you know, and it's it's a

583
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,039
it's a complex analysis there. There are

584
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:49,919
certain chemical manufacturers or

585
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,360
industrial sectors that may though there

586
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,280
are challenges even with this have more

587
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,600
dedicated off-grid supplies. In other

588
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,480
words, like if I build a Habra Bosch

589
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,919
plant of the future, it may make sense

590
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,760
for me to have colllocated solar and

591
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,799
wind. I build that's not competing with

592
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,000
the grid, but is providing me dedicated

593
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,080
power for what I need, but that requires

594
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,159
coordinated action to be able to make a

595
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,960
grid that is responsive to those future

596
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,679
needs. So in a world where there's a lot

597
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,039
of decarbonization pressure on

598
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,360
industries, but there isn't a grid that

599
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,159
allows for that, in a weird way, we're

600
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,960
making the less efficient option to take

601
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,840
these resources off of the grid and make

602
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,000
them be sort of self-serving entities,

603
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,000
right? Um but that a little speaks to

604
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,200
how policy and and you know, I think

605
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,960
some um uh intentional thought about

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,440
these things can really really make a

607
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,679
big impact on on easing this transition.

608
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,880
And again, a role for government, a huge

609
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,640
role for government, really, really

610
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,400
important because it's coordination. All

611
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,720
these things because they couple so many

612
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,039
sectors, each individual sector making

613
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,960
decisions on their own will simply not

614
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,280
be able to create the most efficient

615
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,120
future of a decarbonized. And every time

616
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,760
we make any one of those decisions

617
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,760
that's not as efficient as it could be,

618
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,600
that means we need to generate even more

619
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,600
renewable electricity to meet that

620
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
inefficiency.

621
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,190
[Music]

622
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,240
Let's talk about what the future looks

623
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,480
like here. Um, are there countries, are

624
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,320
there companies, are there venture c I

625
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,520
mean, you know, where is the leadership

626
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,799
coming from? Where is this going to

627
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,559
happen first? Wow, that's a great

628
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,080
question. I you know when I think about

629
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,600
the answer to that question I think of

630
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,640
countries that don't have the luxury of

631
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,559
lowcost natural gas that we have in this

632
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,400
country and in some other parts of the

633
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,400
world that make it really really hard to

634
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,480
displace these fossil consuming

635
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,480
industrial

636
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,760
processes. So think about Japan. Japan

637
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,000
doesn't have any petroleum to speak of.

638
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,720
It doesn't have a very vibrant nuclear

639
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,679
sector anymore thanks to Fukushima.

640
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,919
um very very few options and real

641
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,600
pressure to innovate in order to

642
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,320
continue to support its industrial

643
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,640
sector. I think we'll see things there

644
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,360
start to happen. I think in Germany

645
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,520
where there's a very strong green

646
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,480
movement again no nuclear power or

647
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,159
declining nuclear power but a very very

648
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,200
strong industrial base as well

649
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,840
particularly chemicals. There's huge

650
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,320
pressure to see innovation that that

651
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,600
will bring these processes online first,

652
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,039
I think. And as I think it's just

653
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
reflecting on the names of the guys who

654
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,320
invented the processes we've been

655
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,760
talking about, those are all Germans.

656
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,080
Yeah. Aubber and Bosch and Fisher and

657
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,240
motivated, you know, actually for the

658
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,159
need to generate those things due to war

659
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,440
efforts, you know, in in the early 20th

660
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,799
century, right? That's what really

661
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,960
motivated those similar issues of of

662
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,640
stranded capacity, right? But for

663
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,039
different reasons, geopolitical reasons.

664
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
Now different reasons are motivating

665
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,679
that. But but I I agree that I think

666
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,120
that the places where you will see this

667
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:12,159
are is where you have one an appetite

668
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,880
political or otherwise appetite for

669
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,919
making these investments, right? Um and

670
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,159
also a really need because there isn't a

671
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,080
readily available lowcost alternative,

672
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,520
right? You think about I mean some of

673
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
the pilots have been done in this area

674
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,640
not necessarily in the industrial space

675
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,960
but you think about a place like Hawaii

676
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,360
right you know just the the cost of

677
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,080
transporting something there means that

678
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,520
there are cases where on-site generation

679
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,080
production of certain things makes a lot

680
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,679
of sense right um uh but but you know

681
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,760
and Japan's a great example where you

682
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,360
know local resources could be tapped to

683
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,200
be able to generate some of these things

684
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,320
and that landscape is going to be

685
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,159
complicated and it's going to be also

686
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
very sector dependent right an example

687
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,840
you could think of even in a different

688
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,480
way right is you you have uh mining

689
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,559
operations in in remote locations of

690
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,400
Australia, right? And would you rather

691
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,559
bring in a fuel there or have a

692
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,960
dedicated power plant that allows you in

693
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,120
a better way to decarbonize that mining

694
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,080
operation? Right? There are many

695
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,600
examples that will be the sort of uh

696
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,760
beach head places where these things

697
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,919
probably will get demonstrated. I think

698
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,480
they will get demonstrated and I I mean

699
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,200
this in a very sincere way as they must

700
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,039
with pretty legacy technology. The

701
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,400
technologies we're working on in our lab

702
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,600
aren't going to be the ones that are de

703
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,679
obviously are not going to be the ones

704
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,200
demonstrated today or next week or next

705
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
year, right? The ones that are going to

706
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,120
be demonstrated in that short time span

707
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,360
are the things that we already optimized

708
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,120
a lot, you know, 20 years ago or 30

709
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,640
years ago or 50 years ago, right? But

710
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,520
the reason we work on that basic science

711
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,159
is we would like to give new

712
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,320
options when we're 10 or 15 years out

713
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,240
that allow us to think about when we

714
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,400
need to go to even larger scales. Do we

715
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,400
have another a larger pallet of options

716
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,480
that give us the better ability to work

717
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,840
with intermittent supply, the better

718
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,840
ability to make things at higher

719
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
efficiency, the better ability to deal

720
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,400
with intermittent operation of

721
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,559
industrial processes? Those are those

722
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,320
are why we kind of work on those basic

723
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,760
science to give new options for the

724
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,000
future. So we're going to have, you

725
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,279
know, opportunities in in different

726
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,279
countries that are have their own

727
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,720
motivations, have different natural

728
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,240
resources, have different financial

729
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,919
resources,

730
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
and things are happening. Things are

731
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,080
happening in Europe where governments

732
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,559
and the the you know, the the EU is

733
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,279
funding a lot of demonstration work. The

734
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,400
Japanese are working very hard on

735
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,240
things, but there's there's going to

736
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,080
have to be shared learning. So I think

737
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,919
there's a real opportunity here for

738
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,400
scientific exchange and technical

739
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,039
exchange that goes beyond just leaving

740
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,080
it to companies to promulgate new good

741
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,720
ideas. We we really need international

742
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,480
cooperation on technology. And there's a

743
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,320
another practical reason for that as

744
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,720
well. If we're talking about making

745
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,600
fuels, for

746
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,360
example, they're going to go into things

747
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,279
like ships and airplanes. You can't have

748
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,039
a different fuel in Europe than you have

749
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,440
in the United States or South Africa.

750
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,000
you got your you're back to your Betamax

751
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,679
VHS problem, right? And and you know

752
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
that that means that there has to be

753
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,000
coordination on policy at a very high

754
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,679
level to make all of this stuff work

755
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,600
ultimately. and and the the piece of

756
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,080
fuels is actually a really important

757
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,840
piece. Um because you know what you're

758
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,520
going to actually have in the future is

759
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,159
you know you may have certain countries

760
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,000
because of their renewable energy base

761
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,480
and the type of industrial sectors they

762
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,200
have that might be really good

763
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,240
candidates to produce certain renewable

764
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,559
fuels like ammonia or electricity

765
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,880
derived hydrocarbons for example, right?

766
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,120
And those may not be the historical

767
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,039
places where we generated those. Right?

768
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,960
which means that even like the transport

769
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,799
of fuels around the world is going to

770
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,559
have to change. That means there's going

771
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,960
to be geopolitical consequences to that

772
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,200
for sure, right? Um and then that also

773
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,679
means there needs to be coupling between

774
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,880
how you best leverage the fuel where it

775
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,279
may be used with how it's generated.

776
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,120
Like an example is you may for example

777
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,640
have a really high wind or solar

778
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,840
resource that you're going to use to

779
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,000
make ammonia in in in let's take an

780
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,679
example in Brazil and you transport that

781
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,600
to Europe where you're going to cash out

782
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,600
that ammonia into hydrogen to power an

783
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,679
industrial sector. So then there has to

784
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,440
be coupling between those two. Um and

785
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,559
and actually, you know, some of the

786
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,679
major energy trading companies have

787
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,520
actually begun to open desks that trade

788
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,279
ammonia because they recognize in the

789
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,600
future there are going to be new energy

790
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,919
vectors that are going to be used around

791
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,760
the world and that those are going to be

792
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,840
traded like commodities just like we

793
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,480
trade commodities of fossil fuels right

794
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,480
now. So give me your best guess given

795
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,840
like the science trends now, the policy

796
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,480
trends. When are we going to have plants

797
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,679
that produce steel in a better way that

798
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,120
produce uh fertilizer in the ways that

799
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,960
like the kind of stuff that has come out

800
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,200
of your lab? Is that is this a 10 year

801
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,679
away thing? Is this a Well, I think you

802
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,520
know some of these some of these plants

803
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,799
exist now. I mean there there are

804
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,120
demonstrations. There's a there's a

805
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,840
green ammonia plant that was built in

806
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,159
the Sinai, but it's more demo couple

807
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,039
versus like big scale. Yeah, it is. And

808
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,200
they're looking at an opportunity.

809
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,360
there's a lot of sun uh that they can

810
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,960
use and and there's conventional

811
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,799
generation and a reasonable grid.

812
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,840
There's a big market for ammonia in

813
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,320
Europe that they can easily access with

814
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,840
short ship trips and so on. So, you

815
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,000
know, you get facilities like that

816
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,159
starting to pop up and knowledge being

817
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,559
acquired. There is some direct reduction

818
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,240
of iron ore that things are starting to

819
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,039
happen and the question is how fast can

820
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
the pace be? There are demonstrations of

821
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,320
those like I said you know these

822
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,840
developments when they get to scale they

823
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,080
proceed through kind of this iterative

824
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,320
process right I think the question is

825
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,760
not so

826
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,840
much because we already have things at

827
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,760
at at reasonable scales I I think that

828
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,360
those are going to mature but at the

829
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,520
same time they're going to be new things

830
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,360
that will supplant them right um and

831
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,000
those will start to come online as we

832
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,320
progress at the end of this decade and

833
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,480
into into the next one right and that

834
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,000
process will continually

835
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,679
get to a point where we reach a level of

836
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,279
decarbonization, a high level of

837
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,200
decarbonization in these industrial

838
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,520
sectors that meets all these other

839
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
criteria. And that's a, you know, I

840
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,039
think what's fascinating about it and

841
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,559
maybe a little unpredictable about it is

842
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,360
that all the pieces are each moving. The

843
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,960
ground is moving in every way around us,

844
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,640
right? There's changes to the grid,

845
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,640
there's changes to policy, there's also

846
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,640
changes to feed stock inputs, there's

847
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,399
changes to the regulatory landscape. And

848
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,159
that's also coupled with new

849
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,159
developments in the technology and new

850
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,760
science that's that's coming up, right?

851
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,200
You know, in a way, the fact that

852
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,120
everything is moving makes me optimistic

853
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,640
cuz if only one was and the others

854
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,039
weren't, then I would say we should be

855
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,320
really worried cuz we need them to all

856
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,760
move together. But the fact that they're

857
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,080
all moving together makes me think that

858
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,760
this is something that is very tractable

859
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,080
time scale that's going to matter for

860
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,360
climate. But it's going to only matter

861
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,480
if we are cognizant of aware of and we

862
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,720
have both the political will and and new

863
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
uh of our best and brightest working on

864
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,399
the basic science and technical

865
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,919
challenges to address these problems but

866
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,760
they're tractable. I mean I haven't

867
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,600
heard you say once in the course of this

868
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,360
discussion we don't know how to do that

869
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,679
or there's no way to do that or can't be

870
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,679
done. It's it's a question of finding

871
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,320
the ways and that's why I feel

872
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,399
optimistic as well.
