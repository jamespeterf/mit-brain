1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,560
so let's consider this problem of

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,680
generating images from text commands I

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,080
can tell the model what content I want

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,719
to create by describing that content in

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,879
natural language for example if I type

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:17,640
in bird the model should output an image

7
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,640
of a bird but how does the model know

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,160
which bird to generate if the model

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,680
outputs an image of a robin that does

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,039
indeed match the label bird but it also

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,679
would have been fine to generate a

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,640
different kind of bird so the way

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,000
generative models handle this mgy is by

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,719
randomizing the output and they achieve

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,280
this by inserting random variables into

16
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,079
the model you can think of these random

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,360
variables like the roll of dice so in

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,600
our example one roll of the dice will

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,760
result in one kind of bird a robin

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
another roll will result in another kind

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,079
of bird maybe a blue bird and rolling

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,399
again we might get a parrot for more MIT

23
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:59,079
