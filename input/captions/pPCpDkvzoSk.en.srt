1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,440
Thank you. Um, it's a pleasure to be

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,200
here today with you. I figured I'd start

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,240
with a little introduction about my

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,880
background and then let Key introduce

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,600
himself. But, um, I've been at MIT for

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,520
about six years. And this is actually

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
the first year where my lab is about

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,760
half funded by industry. So I hope what

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,599
you can get out of the session

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
especially if you're a corporation

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,559
interested in engaging with MIT at

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,440
earlier stage as well as at later stage

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,520
uh innovation how you can engage and I

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,680
think that's something that meets done

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,480
really really well. Um so as uh Katarina

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,239
mentioned I currently have two startups

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,079
that are housed at the engine and one

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,640
that is housed in Houston and they're in

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,760
very different areas. We have employed

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
all of the resources that MIT has for

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,199
doing startups ranging from Dish Fonde

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,800
Center funding to the Delta V uh

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,880
accelerator program um as well as uh the

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,200
engine resources following spinout. So

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
uh that's a bit about me. Key would you

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
tell us a little bit about yourself and

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,479
how you've engaged with MIT?

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,560
>> Yeah, sure. So hi everybody. Um my name

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,240
is Kay Honda. I am the senior vice

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
president and head of corporate

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,280
venturing of limit makers. Um I've been

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,240
working for uh energy industries for

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,040
about 20 years right now and um

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,880
basically right now my role is to access

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,079
to the new technologies new business

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
ideas here in states and look for the

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,280
new business opportunities for the uh

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,280
the entireitsu group. Um Iditsu is the

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,360
basically the energy supplier but more

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,439
focused on the oil refining. So we

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,000
import crude oil from the different

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,399
countries and refining our refineries.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
We have uh six group refineries in

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,520
Japan, one in Vietnam and supply supply

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,159
to the different uh customers uh such as

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,479
like airlines um shipping companies or

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:06,159
know industrial players and um I was the

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,640
so uh we set up Americas back in 2020

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,599
during the covid where we wanted to you

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,560
know uh focus more towards creating a

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,560
new business from the startups and I was

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,520
actually the few members who launched

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,319
the uh company started operations there

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,120
and I think it was about two three years

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,239
ago we started to so we set up a company

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,560
in Bay Area San Jose California and then

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,120
expanded the footprint to Houston Texas

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,720
where there's huge energy hub there in

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,400
states and together uh we expanded to

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,120
the east coast and we thought that you

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,319
know um Boston Cambridge area is a very

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,280
much um important place for us to

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,920
explore the startup ecosystem. So from

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,440
there uh we started to engage with MIT.

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,080
We started from uh joining the uh IOP

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,160
program as well as uh MIT energy

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
initiative because we are energy company

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,680
and we tried to be one of the you know

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,000
players that would um be part of the

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,319
like startup ecosystem. So started to

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,640
explore the space uh together with MIT.

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,000
So that was like a initial you know uh

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,680
initiative that we we had made so far.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,599
>> Excellent. Thank you. Um something that

75
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
you had mentioned is that you actually

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,879
physically expanded to bring folks from

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
Iditzu to the west coast to Houston and

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,599
now to Cambridge. We've interacted with

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,840
Shin a lot who is the person who's based

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,400
in Cambridge. How do you think having

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,560
people in the city where you're trying

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
to engage with faculty and startups has

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,799
impacted your ability to do that?

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,200
>> Yeah. So I I believe physical presence

85
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,920
is super important for us. uh because

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,560
one uh the talking about the venture

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,760
side uh you know uh looking at the

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
startup ecosystem or um even uh

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,640
connecting with the startups it was

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,519
pretty new for us um is like a century

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,439
old company very you know stable b very

92
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,239
conservative company doing the oil

93
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,480
refining uh so we have to you know break

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,720
have a breakthrough to access to the new

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,640
technologies by having ourselves here

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,280
and actually you know talking with the

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,519
entrepreneurs or the faculty is here and

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
I I think you mentioned about Shing. Uh

99
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,320
Shin is sitting over there. Uh he's

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,639
taking care of the R&D side. So I'm on

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,440
the venture side, he's in the R&D side

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,800
and uh he's exploring the new uh let's

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,600
say the joint R&D activities uh with the

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,400
different uh universities including MIT

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,560
and I guess again sitting together in

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,160
you know same room uh on the same table

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
and then you know discussing what will

108
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,199
be the new opportunities for us together

109
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
with the focal entrepreneurs are very

110
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
crucial for us to explore this new

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,040
field.

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,720
>> Thank you. So along with that, what

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
qualities do you look for? So if there's

114
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,240
a startup in the room or a faculty

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
member who wants to engage, what what

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,479
qualities do you look for in an academic

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
partner or startup when you're thinking

118
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,680
about collaborating with them?

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,600
>> Yeah. So um from my venture perspective,

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,479
I guess it depends on what kind of

121
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,880
stages the startups are in. Uh we don't,

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,720
you know, restrict ourselves of sticking

123
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,199
to whether it's a early stage or whether

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,080
it's a later stage. we have a pretty

125
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,479
much broader uh perspect perspectives of

126
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,160
you know engaging depending on what the

127
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:26,080
startups which stage they are in. So um

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,919
but having that said uh I guess uh we

129
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,720
have been acting with the early stage

130
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,680
startup recently and I guess um the

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,000
we uh very much emphasize on what kind

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
of capabilities do they have what kind

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
of uniqueness whether it's it will be

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,479
like a technology wise perhaps it will

135
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,800
be like IP wise perhaps it will be like

136
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,160
a business model wise those kind of

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,080
uniqueness that we as edit don't have uh

138
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,479
is very important for us because that's

139
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
the fundamental for us to explore this

140
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,759
new business opportunities.

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,520
>> So along with that does it have a focus

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
area? Are you focused specifically on

143
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,840
the energy space? You mentioned being

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,600
members of mighty or is it a broader

145
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,720
interest in the ecosystem?

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,680
>> Yeah. Yeah. So uh we define like three

147
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,960
uh focus areas at this point. It's very

148
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,600
broad I would say. Uh one is so it's all

149
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,280
about the disruption. So we need to

150
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,919
think about what will be the disrupted

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,560
technologies for our business. Uh that's

152
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,280
because um there's a you know different

153
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,000
teams in our organization where um some

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,240
business units do have a new business

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,520
development team doing those by

156
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,919
themselves and I guess uh for our role

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,160
we have to go beyond that uh meaning

158
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,479
that what will be the disruptive uh

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,520
technology of the business would affect

160
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,039
to the current business units. So having

161
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,560
that said uh we focus uh three areas.

162
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,840
One is uh the disruptive uh disruptions

163
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,759
for the the current business. The second

164
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
is uh the disruption for the energy

165
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,400
industry as a whole and third is more in

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,759
general disruption for like entire

167
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,440
society. So I guess um po Paul in the

168
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,080
you know the previous uh presentation

169
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,960
mentioned about more around AI. AI is

170
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,120
very much you know new for us and I

171
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,840
guess um this is very important topic

172
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,960
for us to explore but to be honest uh we

173
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,000
are very much in a high you know high um

174
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,840
capex intensive oil refining area you

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,759
know we are not that good at you you

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,240
know uh installing software or perhaps

177
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
utilizing AI. So our team might be the

178
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,960
ones that would uh know fill in the gap

179
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,199
between the the conventional uh huge

180
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,720
corporates and installing those thinking

181
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
about the insttoring those you know new

182
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
types of technologies that would enable

183
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,440
us to be uh much sustainable as a

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
company.

185
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,319
>> Excellent. Thank you. That's a great

186
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,800
overview of what your interests are. Um

187
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,960
so when you think about the types of

188
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,280
kind of capital inensive tough tech

189
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,280
especially ones that I amu has looked at

190
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
um within MIT and within kind of the

191
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
startup ecosystem what do you think are

192
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,800
some of the biggest challenges you've

193
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
seen for translating that tech to

194
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,440
something that is scalable and

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240
deployable?

196
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,840
>> Yeah. So we have been been seeing you

197
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,879
know um many uh interesting technologies

198
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,199
and I feel to to be honest uh the most

199
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,840
important part is funding I guess

200
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,039
because you know um I see many

201
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,160
entrepreneurs uh some are good but still

202
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,399
some are not that as good as you know uh

203
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
you know uh doing a research or perhaps

204
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,719
uh you know uh scaling up the

205
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,360
technologies uh compared with you know

206
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,240
thinking about the fundraising and um

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,440
there's A I I think uh in the previous

208
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,760
uh presentation um Michael mentioned

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,320
about the the you know difficulties

210
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
about the funding as well and uh it's

211
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
the reality where you know uh there's a

212
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,760
momentum of uh some of the uh technology

213
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,800
might be uh more attractive in specific

214
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,000
uh timeline whereas someone's some somes

215
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,240
are pretty difficult and I guess um

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,120
there's a you know um trends and

217
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,320
momentum that uh you the entrepreneurs

218
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,200
would face the difficulties. Um we you

219
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,279
know I feel uh entrepreneurs have to you

220
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,640
know have a different options to access

221
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,959
to those fundings. uh recently we so

222
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,760
actually we are trying to close one deal

223
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,519
today to invest to one of the startups

224
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
and uh I like the the founder and the

225
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,680
CEO of the company because there's a

226
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
different reasons but one of them was

227
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,320
she was listing all the you know the

228
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,000
funding options that she could explore

229
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
whether it's like a small small amount

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
whether it's like a larger amount and

231
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,640
you know the larger ones would take time

232
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,880
and then you know um so thinking about

233
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,200
what kind of funding option you should

234
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,760
have uh depending on which stage you

235
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
are, it's always you know important to

236
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,560
secure those funding so that the company

237
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
would run properly and you can actually

238
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,040
um you know push forward whatever the

239
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,920
strategy you have as a company. So, how

240
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,240
do you think about Idommitsu's role as a

241
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,000
funer um in terms of the timeline of

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,640
toughte? Because I do know that's been

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,640
kind of a a point of tension where

244
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,399
conventional VC a lot of times wants to

245
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,040
move very quickly and tough tech often

246
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
takes a lot longer to develop. So, how

247
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
do you balance that?

248
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,720
>> Yeah. Yeah. So um we have been learning

249
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,720
a lot uh by through you know um having

250
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,200
deal flows there and uh for us it there

251
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,240
were so many learnings of how we could

252
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,200
adapt to uh the how you know financial

253
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,959
VCs act in a high-speed way of making

254
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,880
the decisions to invest and um there's

255
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,720
some that we can adopt but but there's

256
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,519
you know in in reality there's there's

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,399
some that we cannot adopt and um

258
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,640
thinking about the timeline of so we see

259
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,959
more towards like a strategic way of how

260
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,399
we could commercialize and make the

261
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,320
business rather than just you know

262
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,920
thinking about the financial returns we

263
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,360
go hybrid. Um so in the sense uh we need

264
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
to make a you know longerterm

265
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,480
relationship with some of the

266
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,959
entrepreneurs uh that has a great

267
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,880
technology or the business ideas and

268
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,440
from there we think about what will be

269
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,760
like a milestones for let's say uh five

270
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,600
years 10 years uh what kind of challenge

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,760
they would face uh in each milestone and

272
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,399
uh what kind of you know uh enablers

273
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,959
they need to overcome those challenges.

274
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,920
So longer term relationship it's perhaps

275
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,560
it's close to what uh R&D side of

276
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,720
thinking um because you know you you

277
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,839
never can you know immediately uh

278
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,399
succeed uh commercializing any uh you

279
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,480
know uh technology the the commercial

280
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,640
plant in let's say one or two years it

281
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,600
takes time

282
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,160
>> thank you um so you've mentioned a few

283
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,040
ways that has interacted especially with

284
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,720
startups what do you think are the uh

285
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,640
most effective ways you found of

286
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
interacting with folks at MIT and

287
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,440
spinouts and also just kind of the

288
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Cambridge startup ecosystem.

289
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,279
So I I think uh I haven't reached the

290
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
goal yet because uh I have been doing

291
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,440
this for about five years but still it's

292
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,680
five years many you know VCs have been

293
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,240
acting in this space for like 20 30

294
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,680
years and I'm still learning from many

295
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,760
many people surrounded uh here uh you

296
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,480
know many people many faculties or you

297
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,639
know many researchers uh every single

298
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,120
you know comments or the advice is very

299
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:38,000
you know um

300
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,440
very useful for myself and um I I guess

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,519
um for us it's it's important to

302
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
interact more with the different people

303
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,320
here and you know uh think about what

304
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,760
will be the a better way for us to

305
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:56,160
explore this uh ventures venture field

306
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,720
and um yeah um I I think uh going back

307
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,519
to your question in the initial ones so

308
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,720
having us physically in myself in Bay

309
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,560
Area uh Shing in Austin. Uh that was

310
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,800
very important for us because it was

311
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,880
much easier to for us to access to the

312
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
different people here. Uh I think

313
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,920
there's a you know I think a startup

314
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,480
because this is a pretty small world and

315
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,720
you might can you know get to know the

316
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,040
person who met in the Bay Area again in

317
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,760
the Boston and that's happening I think

318
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,959
that's happening again and again and so

319
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,519
um having us uh actual presence here and

320
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,760
you know making a progress of whatever

321
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
we want to achieve in a detailed

322
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,680
discussion that's uh very important for

323
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,360
us to have at this point. Yeah, I do

324
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,160
have to say from our perspective, it's

325
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,079
been very helpful to have in-person

326
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
conversations and I think both our

327
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,320
relationship with Shin on the R&D side

328
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,959
for my group as well as um working with

329
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,959
you through two of our startups has been

330
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,320
so much more helpful to have in-person

331
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,800
conversations and I think that really

332
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,959
does speed a lot of the discussion and

333
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,800
potential collaborations.

334
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,800
um kind of along with that, what do you

335
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,399
think you've learned or taken away from

336
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
your interactions at MIT that might be

337
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:15,360
different from Bay Area?

338
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,160
>> Yeah. So um the huge difference is um

339
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,639
it's obvious that uh this place is very

340
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,959
academia centralized uh meaning that

341
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,519
there is many there's many opportunities

342
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,360
but I feel like more around the funding

343
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,600
uh there's many investors there some

344
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,760
corporates are there if you think about

345
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,920
just energy side um it's not like Boston

346
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,760
it's not like Bay Area it's spread

347
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,839
around around all around states and I I

348
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,519
do understand that Houston has a huge

349
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,320
energy hub but still that's like

350
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,920
conventional uh energy industry there's

351
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,240
some you know startups are coming out

352
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,320
from there but then but the you know

353
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,720
energy startups are very much spread

354
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,639
around the states or even to the Canada

355
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,760
we you know access to the Canadian uh

356
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,800
startups well um so what's the so did I

357
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,040
>> just like what what are the key

358
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,040
takeaways from interacting with Boston

359
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,839
versus Cambridge versus or Boston versus

360
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,240
Bay Area

361
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,000
>> yeah so that um so um having the access

362
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,560
to the different characteristics of the

363
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,760
ecosystem is you know again uh learning

364
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,920
from us uh just having us in a barrier

365
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,040
didn't make sense for us because um

366
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,600
there's no much there are many academ

367
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,279
but still there's no much industrial

368
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,519
connections there um I feel that MIT has

369
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,160
been bringing uh industrials together

370
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,320
with this the entrepreneurs and also

371
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
some of the investors together in these

372
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,519
kind of you know conference es. So this

373
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,320
is very useful and helpful for us. Um I

374
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,120
would uh you know look forward to have

375
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,839
this kind of uh same occasions in

376
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,720
different places and that I think that

377
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,759
would also help entrepreneurs to expand

378
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,680
you know uh make su make their uh

379
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,759
business successful in terms of the

380
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,600
growth in terms of in raising the fund

381
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,320
and having the commercial you know

382
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,320
advice or you know the um pilot testing

383
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
or whatever the achievement they need to

384
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,920
have at this moment.

385
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,839
>> Thank you. So, you mentioned that there

386
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,480
are a lot of resources in both the Bay

387
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,560
Area and in Cambridge. Um, Houston, it

388
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,639
sounds like the ecosystems not as well

389
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,600
developed. I know Greentown Labs just

390
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,279
opened a site there and um MIT, the

391
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
Martin Trust Center, is building some

392
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,120
new collaborations there. But what do

393
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,120
you think is missing there to kind of

394
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
build up the equivalent of what we have

395
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
here

396
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,600
>> for the energy sector?

397
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:42,079
Um I I see uh Texas is the place where

398
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,360
many energy related startups doing the

399
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,839
pilot project there uh because they have

400
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,639
uh you know abundant resources you know

401
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,120
they have a uh great access to the

402
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,800
industrial players. So I I think it's

403
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
the matter of the different

404
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,199
differentiating the region by region. Uh

405
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,279
I don't think you know Houston needs to

406
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,000
be more like Bay Area where you know

407
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,559
it's it's impossible because Bayer has a

408
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,199
huge history of you know building the

409
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,199
software uh tech companies and that's

410
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,919
the you know attitude that people want

411
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,120
to have there whereas Houston is more

412
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,079
you know more energy spaces. So but you

413
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,600
know um for us uh understanding what is

414
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,000
the characteristics of the each

415
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,400
ecosystem we can leverage from there and

416
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,320
access to uh whoever we want to reach

417
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,919
out to and this is also I believe uh uh

418
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,799
tied to uh some of the startups that you

419
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,160
know uh misses the opportunities how

420
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,559
they could um reach out to the uh the

421
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,120
people that they want to reach out to uh

422
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,360
there's many people who could possibly

423
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,960
you know help them, support them in a

424
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,919
different ways and uh trying to uh

425
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,080
understand where you should head to and

426
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,000
what kind of help you wanted to receive

427
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,799
from the different uh regions and the

428
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,799
different players is very important for

429
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,840
us as well as you know entrepreneur side

430
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,200
as well.

431
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,880
>> Excellent. So along with that there are

432
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,720
probably some entrepreneurs in the room

433
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,880
who are thinking about how to better

434
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,440
engage with companies like Initu. Um,

435
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,480
how do you think a startup can position

436
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,360
themselves the best for a strategic

437
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,960
partnership with Initu or funding or

438
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,240
depending on how they want to interact

439
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,320
with you?

440
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,320
>> Yes. So, um, to be honest, um, we are

441
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,000
like a very, as I mentioned,

442
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,280
conservative oil refining company. uh

443
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,840
and on top of that we really think about

444
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,880
the strategic way of how we could uh

445
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,480
collaborate with the startups. So having

446
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,880
that said, we don't have we don't want

447
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,559
to do like let's say uh do the pilot

448
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,400
testing within two or three weeks. We

449
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,400
don't want to you know make decisions in

450
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,280
very very short term. We look for the

451
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,039
more future opportun opportunities uh 10

452
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:05,280
years or beyond. Um so in the sense I I

453
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,679
feel like um startups don't have to

454
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,160
adopt everything but still uh there

455
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,160
should

456
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,960
startups might need some kind of the

457
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,880
patience for understanding what the

458
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,760
industrial players what the corporates

459
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,720
thinking and um from the different

460
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,960
discussion uh I talk with one of the

461
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,440
well-known uh entrepreneur who has been

462
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,840
raising you know three-digit million uh

463
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,240
US dollars those fundings in the past.

464
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,080
He's a serious uh entrepreneur uh

465
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,640
working for the energy uh startup and um

466
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,120
he was uh really mentioning about the

467
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,000
importance of you know starting to

468
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,240
engage with the corporates as early as

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,120
possible because he knows that the

470
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,960
corporates take time and this is you

471
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,200
know this is the real uh we want to you

472
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,799
know speed up and we want it to be like

473
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,160
a a financial vis but it's uh but you

474
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,480
know um we can partially do but for 100%

475
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,360
we cannot be financial visas we have a

476
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,200
different appetite for here so um I was

477
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,160
very you know um convinced with uh the

478
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,320
the his comments where uh building a

479
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,400
relationship with early as possible with

480
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
the corporates that doesn't mean I

481
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,360
that's because I'm working in the

482
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,360
corporates but still you know that's a

483
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,679
reality in the industry and I guess um

484
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,400
not only about the funding but also the

485
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,760
engagement or perhaps even the small

486
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,720
miscellaneous is you know um you know um

487
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,640
takeaways from the corporates whatever

488
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,480
you want to build whatever you want to

489
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,120
you know um achieve uh through your uh

490
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,000
entrepreneurship you might can have uh

491
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,240
you know um different understandings

492
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
different find out from the uh corporate

493
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,600
side as well

494
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,480
>> yeah I do have to say that's been really

495
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,640
beneficial to us um our startups have

496
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,039
heavily relied on non-dilutive funding

497
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,200
especially government uh grants and

498
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,440
having it as a strategic partner on

499
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,159
those applications even just as a

500
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,080
potential customer down the line um

501
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,640
definitely adds a lot of value that's

502
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,919
not necessarily just investment right so

503
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,120
I think um thinking of ways of exploring

504
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,000
collaboration beyond simply just

505
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,880
partnerships for investing is a great

506
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,200
way to interact uh right

507
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,600
>> yeah um so you've interacted with a lot

508
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,919
of startups at this point. Um, do you

509
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,080
have an example of one that has kind of

510
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,600
exceeded your expectations or gone

511
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,760
beyond what you were originally hoping

512
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,640
for? And what what was the story there

513
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:45,120
and why do you think it exceeded?

514
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:48,640
>> Um, so I might would touch on uh your

515
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,640
startup. So we just started you know our

516
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,360
discussion. So it's in a very early

517
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,200
stage right now. Um so you might can you

518
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,840
know introduce some of your what you're

519
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
working for but um it has a so we are

520
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,480
oil refer we are energy supplier but we

521
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,360
do some agricultural business as well

522
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:10,480
and uh we do pesticidized fertilizer

523
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:14,320
side and uh actually uh I think um 70

524
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,039
more than 70 70% of the uh rice uh made

525
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,320
in California we supply the herbicide

526
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,400
for them so we are pretty much uh have a

527
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,600
good presence in states as

528
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,280
And um

529
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,919
I think initial you know interaction was

530
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,880
with you and Shing I guess uh talking

531
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,400
about the joint R&D uh around your

532
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,039
research area where uh you you mentioned

533
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,600
you are trying to launch the new startup

534
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,520
uh focusing on uh having a new

535
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,559
technology that would u enhance um micro

536
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,960
activities for the past installed to the

537
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,400
pesticides that resale. So that was kind

538
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,720
of like a you know um I would say a

539
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,039
quick win for us because we do have a

540
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,840
business units uh acting in states and

541
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,200
also uh the new technology might would

542
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,720
fit to whatever we sell and would make a

543
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,919
new additional value to our products and

544
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,760
um we so but again it's only at the

545
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,000
early stage so we need to you know go

546
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,640
through what will be like a good way to

547
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,919
pilot this testing and what will be the

548
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,720
uh way to value this uh new additional

549
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,480
value here. And so you know there's many

550
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,360
things we need to go through there but

551
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,080
still um in the past we didn't have much

552
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,640
uh discussion to be honest myself and

553
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,960
our team in the venture team we didn't

554
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,640
have much uh discussion with the uh

555
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,600
conventional business units because they

556
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,679
are too much busy you know focusing on

557
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,799
let's say running the refineries or

558
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,679
selling oil products. So um having the

559
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,320
new solution was you know uh not that

560
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,799
you know beneficial for us but uh having

561
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,360
this new technology adopting to the our

562
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,000
product was like kind of like you know

563
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,760
uh quick solution for us to explore and

564
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,120
you might can introduce.

565
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,480
>> Yeah um thank you for that. So um the

566
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,600
company that K's talking about is Seiya

567
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,440
Bio. We have a stabilization technology

568
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,440
that allows you to manufacture microbes

569
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
at scale that we couldn't before. And

570
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,080
we're initially targeting uh

571
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,919
regenerative agricultures using microbes

572
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,480
in place of or to enhance uh

573
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,559
agrochemicals. Uh we've actually been a

574
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,919
company for about three years now, but

575
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,360
we've mostly been running on

576
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,880
non-dilutive funding. And I think

577
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,400
something that was interesting and some

578
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,840
of the learnings we took away with that

579
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,360
are important, the importance of

580
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,840
corporate partnerships that don't

581
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,240
necessarily involve investment. So

582
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,320
because it's a very um kind of

583
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,440
straightforward and lowcost technology,

584
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,120
we haven't uh seen the benefit of taking

585
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,799
VC money and kind of going with a

586
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,480
conventional um VC funded startup model.

587
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,080
So what we needed were proof that people

588
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,559
would buy our products once we made

589
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,200
them. And so, um, you know, interactions

590
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,520
with Idomitsu and, um, figuring out how

591
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,679
we can partner with these companies in

592
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,480
ways that don't involve strictly just

593
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,799
funding, um, I think has really

594
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,960
benefited us as well. And, um, it's been

595
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,120
interesting to, um, have one startup

596
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,200
that's focused on kind of that and then

597
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,120
another one that's more on, um,

598
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,240
decarbonizing steel that definitely

599
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,559
needs the capex of a conventional VC.

600
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,159
Um, so I do want to make sure we leave

601
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,919
time for questions. We'll do a couple

602
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,520
more at the end, but um it would be

603
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,799
great if we could take some audience

604
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:42,440
questions now.

605
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,440
>> Who has questions for our speakers?

606
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,559
Okay.

607
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,520
Thank you.

608
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:58,559
Um great talk. Um I have a question

609
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,880
about um two of you. Um so how do you

610
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,279
define the success of the partnership

611
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,760
because uh for the corporation's

612
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,919
perspective of course the sensing and

613
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,760
the disruption is really really really

614
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,880
critical but um you must have the time

615
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,360
frame right in next three years to five

616
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,279
years 10 years. So how do you define the

617
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:24,240
success from this partnership? Because

618
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:29,120
of course MIT is a great partner and

619
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,840
vehicle to get this access to variety of

620
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,360
um technologies and cutting edge ideas

621
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,480
and all and also the startups but not

622
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:43,039
only the funding probably there must be

623
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:46,000
something um Mr. Honda wants to achieve

624
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,360
in certain time frame that requires to

625
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,600
achieve uh the strategic goal and also

626
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,400
from the MIT point of view. um you know

627
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,559
matching the corporations

628
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,279
you may have that expectation okay this

629
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,120
corporation can also lead the

630
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,000
commercialization

631
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,880
uh strategy also access to the potential

632
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,679
customers and provide references but

633
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,039
that's not enough to

634
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,400
get the company really going and also

635
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,960
achieve certain I don't know financial

636
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,080
returns or strategic value which is

637
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,000
quite

638
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,520
vague. So my question going back to the

639
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,279
definition of success and which time

640
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,120
frame

641
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,720
>> and how MIT is expecting to help them

642
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,960
achieve.

643
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,159
>> All right. Um yeah that that's a really

644
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,360
really good question and uh it's very

645
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,880
difficult for us to define the the

646
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,039
success. I would say it it will be uh

647
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,600
the same wording what we call like

648
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,799
strategic return from engagement with

649
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,440
the startups and uh every time it

650
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,679
depends on which deal we see uh some of

651
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,279
the early stage startup it takes time if

652
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,520
it's more like like like capex intensive

653
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,919
uh energy startups it doesn't happen

654
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,720
within like five 10 years you have to

655
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,240
have you know resiliency there and we

656
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,520
have to support them and try to build uh

657
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,240
make them successful and you know uh

658
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,159
eventually we want to have actual

659
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,360
commercialized business together with

660
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,360
them. But you know at the same time uh

661
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,520
if you think about uh the people working

662
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,760
in the corporate side uh they cannot

663
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,600
wait for like 10 years they want to you

664
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,840
know achieve something within that time

665
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,720
frame. So we are setting like a key

666
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,320
milestones uh what can we achieve within

667
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,880
those you know let's say the pilot

668
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,320
testing some of the knowledge that we

669
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,360
can you know u acquire from those stages

670
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,279
we might can you know not IP wise but

671
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,440
more around the general wise we can

672
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,480
adapt to the different perhaps the

673
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,320
research areas or perhaps to the um

674
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,679
thinking about the collaboration with

675
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,279
the different startups or different

676
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:10,159
corporates. So um in general we set uh

677
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,399
some kind of the KPIs and key milestones

678
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,720
when engaging with the startups but it

679
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,960
really depends on what kind of you know

680
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,679
uh startup we are dealing with and uh I

681
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,640
I guess most of them are more like you

682
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,159
know um occur in the information what

683
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,240
kind of uh proof that we can build from

684
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,039
those technologies and how we could be

685
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,080
uh supporting those startups. So not

686
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,559
100% for us but for like you know uh

687
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,559
together us and the entrepreneurs the

688
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,000
startups that might be one of the ways

689
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,320
we think of the strategic return that we

690
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,399
engage with the startups

691
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:55,039
>> and I will say not as much from the MIT

692
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,559
side but as a PI um one of kind of our

693
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,720
milestones is building a long-term

694
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,240
relationship with these companies. Not

695
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,640
every um project is going to be funded

696
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,760
by a company, but I think we've

697
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,440
established some fantastic

698
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,320
collaborations with initu especially

699
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,919
getting access to samples that can be

700
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,840
challenging for academics. So,

701
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,360
especially as we think about scaling

702
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,360
tech in um you know oil and gas if

703
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,559
you're thinking about reducing emissions

704
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,559
or kind of um reusing waste products,

705
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,080
academics getting access to those can be

706
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,760
really challenging. And so building a

707
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,399
core relationship where we know we can

708
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,159
go to IDM2 and ask them for samples and

709
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,080
they're willing to provide them to us

710
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,080
and then likewise when they have a new

711
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,240
problem that pops up they'll come to us

712
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
to try to seek a solution. We want to

713
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,240
have that relationship and establishing

714
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,240
that um I think kind of comfort level

715
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,240
with each other is really where we see

716
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,240
success.

717
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,799
>> Thank you.

718
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,799
other questions.

719
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,559
>> Okay. So, if there aren't other

720
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,600
questions, I just have one more question

721
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,200
for Kay, which is um we've touched on a

722
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,360
lot of different areas and hopefully

723
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,159
everyone will stick around for uh

724
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,919
networking after this, but um

725
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,760
>> is there anything we haven't touched on

726
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,679
that you think would be important for

727
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,279
folks to know either about Idomitsu

728
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,919
specifically and how they interact with

729
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,159
MIT and startups or more generally about

730
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,360
your experience?

731
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,880
>> Yes. So, um

732
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,600
let's see. Um

733
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,559
I I I think um again um

734
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,519
we have been feeling very beneficial

735
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,760
having ourselves here uh as well as

736
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,440
having ourselves in different areas in

737
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,799
Houston in you know uh Bay Area and I

738
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,480
see many uh resources that we can rely

739
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,880
on. um every time I feel uh I discuss

740
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,720
with the other folks in the team that

741
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,880
you know there's plenty of resources

742
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,000
that we can utilize but the question

743
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,159
will be how we access to those resources

744
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,679
the informations the people that we

745
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,640
wanted to interact with and I guess I'm

746
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,720
not promoting IOP

747
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,960
has been you know helping us to you know

748
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,760
connect to the different faculties in

749
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,080
MIT different startups in MIT so that's

750
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:32,080
very crucial uh but uh at the same time

751
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,679
uh for us uh it's more important to you

752
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,000
know generate those connections and how

753
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,039
we expand the connections to the

754
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,360
different people. uh even I'm based in

755
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,840
San Jose, I can access the people in

756
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,039
Boston and as I mentioned it's a very

757
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,799
small world. So how we could cover all

758
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,399
the connections that we want to reach

759
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:59,760
out to and know you know um it's it's

760
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:01,840
it's uh it's my role to you know uh make

761
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,159
the connections as well as how we can

762
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,399
speed up uh trying to reach out to the

763
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,000
right resources the appropriate people

764
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,000
that we want to reach out to. That's

765
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,640
that's uh you know very important

766
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,840
takeaways I have been facing within this

767
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,080
few years.

768
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,640

769
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,159

770

invaluable for my lab and companies that

771
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,360

772
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,200
