1
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,360
um it might have been a little cognitive

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,000
dissonance for those you who know the

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,160
term because today is the lecture I tell

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,439
you why everything I taught you this

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,480
semester is wrong um and maybe I was a

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,599
little reluctant to come in and do that

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,039
but in all seriousness today we're going

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,560
to talk about behavioral

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,679
economics um we're going to talk about

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,640
basically how we can bring this insights

11
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,800
from

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,680
psychology into understanding how we

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
make the models in the semester more

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,719
realistic now once again let's remember

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
the role of models the role of models

16
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,520
remember the George boach saying all

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,079
models are wrong but some are useful

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,719
okay the goal of the models this

19
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,359
semester were to figure out how to

20
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,440
parsimoniously explain the world how to

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,559
give you models that you guys could

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,239
solve in a problem set that have

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,719
enormous explanatory power for how the

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,640
world functions and we've done that that

25
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,559
said

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,080
we can always make our models better and

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,720
as you go on in economics your goal

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,479
should be to think about how we enrich

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,640
these models and make them better but

30
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,040
without losing the goal of parsimony

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,040
without losing the goal of having models

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,240
that are

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
manageable can explain the world which

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,280
means how do we sort of minimally extend

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,560
our models to think about bringing much

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,400
richer

37
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,400
phenomenon so let's talk about so what

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,840
behavioral economics does is essentially

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,360
say look there's a set of realities from

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,040
psychology that we ignore in

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,920
economics behavioral economics is about

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,759
how can we build models to bring in what

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,000
we know is true from psychological

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,840
research and the best example of this is

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,439
models of what we

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,439
call time

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
inconsistency this is the best example

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
of how we bring in an important Insight

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,799
from psychology in a manageable way into

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
our mind

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,479
models okay so the idea of time Inc

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,000
consistency is that a widespread

53
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,560
phenomenon that is not only always shown

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,440
in psychological experiments but in fact

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,360
never rejected in psychological

56
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,239
experiments is the human problem of

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,280
self-control the human problem of

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
self-control we have a problem

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,000
controlling

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,200
ourselves okay and what does this mean

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,680
in economic terms it doesn't mean that

62
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,040
individuals are

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,879
irrational it doesn't mean that the

64
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,000
models we wrote down and the

65
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,239
optimization assumptions we make itly

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,480
wrong what it means is while we can make

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,319
optimal plans we can't carry them out so

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,519
in words think about the optimization

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,840
problem done so far as having two parts

70
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,000
you make an optimal plan and then you

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,000
carry it out we haven't separated those

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
we've just said you decide how many

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,480
cookies in Pizza eat that many cookies

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,599
in pizza but in fact there's two steps

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,080
first you got to decide how many cookies

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,680
in pizza pizza then you got to eat that

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,040
many cookies in Pizza you might think

78
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,720
well that's sort of irrelevant the

79
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,920
Second Step it's trivial but it's not

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,239
it's not trivial Whenever there are

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,560
costs and benefits that differ in

82
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,480
time okay and when there are costs or

83
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,040
benefits at differ in time this can lead

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,480
to self-control problems in particular

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,799
when you have a decision that imposes a

86
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,400
short run cost for a long run benefit

87
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,760
humans will undertake that activity

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,879
when we have an activity that imposes a

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,040
short run cost long-term benefit humans

90
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,360
as a species I don't know maybe other

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,439
species too will undertake that activity

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,080
so for example smoking if you're a

93
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:50,360
smoker 90% of smokers when surveyed say

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,760
they'd like to quit yet 90% do not quit

95
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,120
why because when you wake up in the

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,200
morning you feel awful until you have

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,319
that cigarette you have the cigarette

98
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,000
and you're like okay I'll have a smoke

99
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,400
to I'll quit tomorrow

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,360
okay the idea of I can quit tomorrow

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,120
I'll solve that tomorrow that's a

102
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,920
standard feature of self-control

103
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,760
problems let's think about savings for

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
retirement in our model of retirement

105
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,840
savings we had someone deciding across

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,000
C1 and C2 and they just optimized with

107
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,320
some indifference curve and budget

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,639
constraint we're not saying any of that

109
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,199
math was wrong we're saying in practice

110
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,160
it's actually hard to put the money away

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,080
and save it because in practice once you

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,000
have the money there's a lot of

113
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,400
attractive stuff I talked about how ge

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,400
when you get the job you start saving

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,160
right away but but right away when you

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,199
get the job you want a new car and you

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,639
want a party and things like that so

118
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,280
it's hard to say well yeah I'm going to

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,320
save for 50 years from now so and rather

120
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,919
than going to the party tonight okay

121
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,280
maybe not once again hard to each In

122
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,840
This Crowd we're all we're all a very

123
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,400
sort of self-controlled crowd Rel to

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,240
most Americans but I think we all have

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,199
experien with this okay think about

126
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,320
dieting or exercise things where there's

127
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,720
a with dieting there's a short-run cost

128
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,880
you cannot eat that piece of cake which

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,280
is delicious for a long run benefit

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,759
exercise the short run cost which is

131
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,120
you've got to go work out it takes time

132
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,800
it takes effort for a long run benefit

133
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,720
now once again you all look very fit

134
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,720
maybe you don't feel that way about

135
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,360
dieting exercise but we all have things

136
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,919
we have self-control problems over mine

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,199
is biting my nails I cannot stop biting

138
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,080
my nails I'd like to stop biting my

139
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,840
nails I make plans to stop biting my

140
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,960
nails when I've got a deadline of paper

141
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,400
on my favorite teams on TV I bite my

142
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,840
nails okay I've tried things like the

143
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,479
you can pain on your nails to make them

144
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,800
taste terrible it just tastes terrible

145
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,759
when I bite my nails okay I have a

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,759
self-control problem with all all humans

147
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,600
not all humans most humans suffer from

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,360
self-control problems of one or another

149
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,759
so the question is how do we build that

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,319
into the models we use how do we take

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,800
the kind of parsimonious model we've

152
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:50,800
used and add an element of time

153
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,199
inconsistency well let's come back to

154
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,319
the intertemporal choice model we had

155
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,600
before the interal Choice model was

156
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,960
someone trading off consuming today

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,639
versus consuming tomorrow and and let's

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,919
make that rather than sa vers tomorrow

159
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,280
let's make it the whole Future Let's

160
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,880
make someone's decision let's say that

161
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,840
someone has a has a utility function

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
that depends on the entire future path

163
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,880
of their

164
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,080
consumption okay all that matters to my

165
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,319
utility is

166
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,560
consumption but the entire Future Path

167
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,840
but here's the key thing let's also

168
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,680
remember we learned about discounting

169
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,400
that I care less about the future than I

170
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,039
care about today okay this is remember

171
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,240
with npv we talked about how money today

172
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
is worth more than the money in the

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,560
future which is why people would save

174
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,039
the reason people don't save is because

175
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,039
I care more about today than I do about

176
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,840
the future and those humans have an

177
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,039
inherent discounting of the future that

178
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,400
offsets the return to

179
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,400
saving having putting money aside today

180
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,840
is a benefit you get more tomorrow but

181
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,720
it's a cost which is we'd rather have

182
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,280
 today than tomorrow that's the

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,800
human nature we call that discounting

184
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,360
and we tip the way we typically model

185
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,240
this is we say look we can model your

186
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,960
utility at as the sum from today till

187
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,840
the end of time till you

188
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,199
die of your

189
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,080
consumption in each period you're let's

190
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,280
say you're going to consume the same

191
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,800
amount every time let's say consumption

192
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,039
smooth so C's constant let's just lay

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,280
say say soon same m forever times Delta

194
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,960
to the IUS

195
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,800
T Delta is what we call a discount

196
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,479
Factor Delta is less than one greater

197
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,400
than zero it's the discount factor it's

198
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,240
how much less I care about consumption

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,879
in the

200
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,879
future okay so for example if Delta's

201
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,680
0.9 then that

202
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:53,479
says consuming something next year makes

203
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,800
me 90% as happy as consuming it

204
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,440
today consuming something in two year

205
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,800
and we assume Delta by this functional

206
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,319
formulation is exponential

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,280
okay so we assume consuming something in

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:11,319
two years is 09 squared so it's

209
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,319
081 okay so basically we assume that

210
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,520
exponentially every period in the future

211
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,919
is worth less so next year is worth 0. n

212
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,400
of today two years is 081 of today Etc

213
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,280
so we assume that basically the reason

214
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
people don't my retirement saving sample

215
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,960
is pretty compelling right save 15 years

216
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,960
you're better off than to save for the

217
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,760
next 33 years why don't people do it

218
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,959
then UND do it CU at at a Delta even

219
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,120
arbitrarily close to one 50 years from

220
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,519
now is

221
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,039
irrelevant okay you know if you take you

222
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,640
know 0. n to the 50 okay it's

223
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,000
irrelevant okay or if you do you know

224
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,240
even if it's 095 50 years around you

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,480
don't care about as long as you're

226
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,640
somewhat

227
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,720
impatient the distant future doesn't

228
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,160
matter and that's why people don't say

229
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,640
for retirement okay that's why despite

230
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,200
the incredibly strong incentives I laid

231
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,560
out people people don't because they

232
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,839
discount the

233
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,519
Future Okay questions about why why

234
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,880
question about that

235
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,480
model okay that's our standard economics

236
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,279
model that's what I grew up with that's

237
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,480
what you learn basic economics okay

238
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,760
that's what you learn in the next level

239
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,839
when you go on and do more economics

240
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,399
this is the model you'll learn okay it's

241
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,959
a multiversion period of the

242
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,920
multiversion version of the two period

243
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:26,880
model I taught you but it's

244
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,720
wrong why is it wrong it's wrong because

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,200
every single psychological experiment

246
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,120
ever run shows that discounting is not

247
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,120
exponential but rather

248
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,440
hyperbolic which means that

249
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:49,440
people the discounting of the

250
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,360
future is much much steeper than we get

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,480
when just from a pure exponential

252
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,200
function okay and here's a simple

253
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,600
example of that okay I'm going to do let

254
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,240
me say this example slowly it's

255
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,440
important to get it right imagine I

256
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:09,720
offer you the following okay $100 I

257
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,600
offer you a choice $100 today or $125 in

258
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,399
a

259
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,680
year $100 say $125 in a year you can

260
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,600
just don't don't vote just so guys feel

261
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,040
about this Choice then I offer you a

262
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,880
different choice I say $100 in two

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,600
years versus

264
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,760
$125 in three

265
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,839
years now with this exponential function

266
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,360
that's the same

267
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,880
Choice it's only a 0. n factor between

268
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,680
them it's a one-year Gap so it shouldn't

269
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,200
matter if I if you today versus one year

270
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,920
or two years versus three years it turns

271
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,320
out it matters enormously people always

272
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,040
take the this year but they'll delay it

273
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,600
in the future that is people are willing

274
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,000
are impatient today but willing to be

275
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,680
patient in the

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,200
future and that is an illustration of

277
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,279
self-control

278
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,160
problems that when it's it's about

279
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,320
having your hot little hands you want it

280
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,920
if it's about well will you save in the

281
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,920
future sure I'll save in the future

282
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,279
that's great happy to do

283
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,839
that okay and this example is exactly

284
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,160
why this exponential model is

285
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,320
wrong and the hyperbolic model is

286
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,120
right that basically people feel

287
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,519
differently about today than the future

288
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,800
and so uh an economist Dame L named

289
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,360
davidon at Harvard said look let's make

290
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:34,120
a simple tweak to this model let's reite

291
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,800
WR utility as the utility of today is

292
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:44,279
today's consumption

293
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:48,040
C plus a factor beta times the sum from

294
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:54,600
tomorrow next year till the end of

295
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,600
time times C * Delta to the IUS

296
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,320
t i minus t okay how is this different

297
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,200
than

298
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,480
this all I've done is I've pulled out

299
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,920
today and add an extra Factor B to the

300
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,079
rest of the future beta to the rest of

301
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,560
the future so look at this function

302
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,600
versus this function all I've done is

303
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,839
pulled out one C from the sum kept the

304
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,480
rest of the sum and add an extra factor

305
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,639
beter in front of

306
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,040
this what is that doing that's saying

307
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,120
that starting next year I'm an

308
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,920
exponential

309
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Discounter but with beta less than one

310
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,120
that entire future is wor less than it

311
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,000
today than it would be under an

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,320
exponential

313
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,360
model okay so let me let me um do this

314
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:48,360
in a simple example okay let's say

315
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:52,680
that um uh you have um let's say that uh

316
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,199
you're offered 100 today versus 125 next

317
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,199
year

318
00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:05,440
okay and then as I said so so 100 in t

319
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:13,199
versus 125 and t+ 1 and 100 in t +

320
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:13,199
2 uh 100 and t+ 1 versus 125 and t+

321
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,519
2 well from for this

322
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,079
decision you use this part of the term

323
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,600
which is the same as exponential so as

324
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:30,000
long as Delta isn't very small you're

325
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,240
going to wait so let's say Delta's 0. n

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,120
so that says that next year's is worth

327
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,880
125 time 0.9 which is still greater than

328
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,720
100 so you'd say I'll

329
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,440
wait but for this decision you've got

330
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,959
Delta and

331
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,120
beta and the best s in the laboratory of

332
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,120
beta is

333
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:58,720
0.6 so now it's 125 time9 time .9 time

334
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,839
6 because you've got the regular delay

335
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,560
of a year but you also have this extra

336
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,519
factor which is you really like it today

337
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,759
and care less about tomorrow so now you

338
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,680
reject the

339
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,040
offer and that is a simple

340
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,480
parameterization of how you could reject

341
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,639
this offer but accept this

342
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,800
offer you reject this offer because this

343
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,240
offer has an extra feature that

344
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,680
discounts at

345
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,519
beta okay that is how that is how a very

346
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,920
smart Economist builds a psychological

347
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,680
insight in a relatively simple way into

348
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,120
one of our models take the model tweak a

349
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,240
little bit just pull the C out add a

350
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,240
beta boom you can explain a phenomenal

351
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,000
we couldn't have explained before that's

352
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,240
good

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,880
modeling now to be fair while this looks

354
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,959
simple solving this model turns out to

355
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,040
be a total nightmare okay I

356
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,720
could not teach in this class I'm not

357
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,399
sure I can do it okay even though it's

358
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,079
simple because you've got all these

359
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,880
iterative terms that gets very

360
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,040
complicated okay and which is why we

361
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,519
don't teach it even though it's probably

362
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,519
a better model okay but it's an example

363
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,839
of how you can relatively parsimoniously

364
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,560
incorporate this

365
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,480
idea okay let me give you one final

366
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,839
example let questions about

367
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
this let give you one one other example

368
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,199
to motivate this they did a really cool

369
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,399
experiment in Amsterdam which is they

370
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:20,839
went to people and they said um here's a

371
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,959
snack that you can have in one week what

372
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,399
would you like and there was healthy and

373
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,519
unhealthy snacks mixed in the list they

374
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,639
said you have snack in one week what

375
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,880
would you like about 50% of people chose

376
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,279
the healthy snack

377
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,920
they then came back a week later and

378
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,839
saidou know here's what you chose but

379
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,279
guess what today we're going to let you

380
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,759
change your decision would you like to

381
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,319
change it and almost everyone changed it

382
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,399
to have the unhealthy

383
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:43,639
snack that is when it was a week away

384
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,360
they were happy to wait for the healthy

385
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,240
snack but today they wanted the candy

386
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,440
okay that is timing consistency that's

387
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,920
what this captures that our standard

388
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,440
model does it that's the only math I'm

389
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,639
going to do today the only modeling I'll

390
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,480
do today but that is the an example of

391
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,000
how we can take a deep psychological

392
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,399
insight and build it into our economics

393
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,120
model and enrich it to capture a whole

394
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,319
new set of phenomena this is what and

395
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,399
this is what we do in the course 1413

396
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,920
which is one of our most popular under

397
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,040
grad course when 200 people take it a

398
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,279
year incredibly great course which is

399
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,199
behavioral economics which is teaching

400
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,600
you how you take the next step from 1401

401
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,839
to incorporate these psychological

402
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,040
phenomena into

403
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,040
models okay

404
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,199
yeah that is the the most difficult

405
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,000
there's a lot of hard problems here

406
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,560
what's the right time for frame is a

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
really hard problem here's the even

408
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,440
harder

409
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,880
problem how do you do welfare how do you

410
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,480
do welfare when people make mistakes

411
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,360
we've said welfare is the sum the so

412
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,560
welfare function is the sum of

413
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,759
individual utility functions what if the

414
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
people in individual utility functions

415
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,839
are making mistakes does the government

416
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
still just want to sum up their utility

417
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,839
function does the government want to

418
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,800
correct those mistakes hard question so

419
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,839
that's exactly that's why 14 13 is fun

420
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,519
you struggle with some deep

421
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,480
philosophical issues like

422
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,720
that okay now what I want to do now

423
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,480
rather than writing down other models

424
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,400
because I want to you can take 1413 for

425
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,199
to do that I want to run through a set

426
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,160
of fun insights that we get from

427
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,520
behavioral

428
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,839
economics okay and talk about what they

429
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,559
apply so let me just sort of talk about

430
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,799
some additional insights some other

431
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,520
examples these are sort of other

432
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,520
behavioral

433
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,439
insights that we've worked on over the

434
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,959
past few decades that we'd love to

435
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,480
incorporate into our models to make a

436
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,760
realistic model the first and one of the

437
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,320
most

438
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,320
is loss

439
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,039
aversion and I mentioned this briefly we

440
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
talked about

441
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:42,799
uncertainty which is remember I gave you

442
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,679
guys the gamble win 100 win 125 lose 100

443
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,000
and you mostly didn't take it then I

444
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,240
said well what if it was win 1250 lose

445
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,840
10 more of you should take it not many

446
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,280
more of you did but more of you should

447
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,120
and ultim if I said it was win a125 lose

448
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,320
a dollar everyone all of you should take

449
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,919
it okay unless you're super risk averse

450
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,840
that's a great deal no matter how

451
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:07,559
wealthy you are but it turns out that

452
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,039
that's not true it turns out that even

453
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,360
that basically people turn down gambles

454
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,760
that can be above and beyond what's

455
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,200
explained by risk

456
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,720
aversion okay and the best way to see

457
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:23,880
this is um this great calculation that

458
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,120
was done uh by The Economist Matt Ren so

459
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,559
let's say someone would turn down

460
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,799
someone of an average wealth so they've

461
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:33,080
got you know thousands of dollars

462
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,600
you offer them a 50/50 shot win 11 lose

463
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,320
10 and they turn it down you say well

464
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,080
that's just risk aversion right but if

465
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,000
you apply that risk aversion to other

466
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,480
bets you see how ridiculous that is that

467
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,440
says that you would

468
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:55,360
also turn down win 2100 lose

469
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,440
800 it also means you would lose you

470
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,240
would if I offered you the BET lose a,

471
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,320
win Infinity you would turn it

472
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,120
down that if you're risk averse enough

473
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,600
that you turn down win 100 lose win 110

474
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,440
lose 100 and you extend that same risk

475
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,000
aversion that same parameter impli you

476
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,120
would turn down lose a th win Infinity

477
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,559
none of you would turn that down you

478
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:23,039
sure if you did I'd be disappointed in

479
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,200
you okay so basically the bottom line is

480
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,799
risk aversion can't explain these

481
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,559
decisions what can is the model of loss

482
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,440
aversion which is that people have

483
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,880
endowment

484
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,919
effects that is I care more stuff I have

485
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,960
already I care more about than stuff I

486
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,039
might

487
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,919
get so here's the best example of how we

488
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,080
think about endowment

489
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,559
effects which is that they did an

490
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,720
experiment where they randomly selected

491
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,919
individuals half of them they said

492
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,720
here's a mug it says M or whatever how

493
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,799
much would you pay for this mug and they

494
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,280
got a demand curve and the average

495
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,039
person would have paid $5

496
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,360
the other half the people I'm sorry so

497
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:07,080
no let me go back it was a mug with a

498
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,039
market price of $5 that how much people

499
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,159
want to pay the people pay pay about

500
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,640
$3 then they did a second experiment

501
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,120
randomly they gave a set of other people

502
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,000
they gave them the mug and said how much

503
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,679
would I have to pay you to buy this back

504
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,640
from you and the average person said

505
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,840
$7 same decision right in the one case I

506
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,960
just gave you the mug in other case I

507
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,679
didn't but if the mug is worth $3 to you

508
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,000
to buy why would you only sell it for $7

509
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,880
because once you have it you feel

510
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,480
differently it's an endowment effect

511
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
okay here's a great example from the

512
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,400
from the Nobel prize winning Economist

513
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,039
Richard Taylor okay imagine the

514
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,280
following two questions a you have been

515
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:47,000
exposed to a disease which if contracted

516
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,600
leads to a quick and painless death

517
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,640
within a week the probability you have

518
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,919
this disease is

519
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,120
.1% what would you be willing to pay for

520
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:01,880
a cure that's question one question two

521
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,000
is we need to research this

522
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,360
disease if you're in the sample you'll

523
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,279
have to expose yourself and risk

524
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,600
yourself to a 0.1% chance of

525
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,080
dying how much would I have to pay you

526
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,320
to be in the

527
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,640
experiment now I hope you could see that

528
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,640
as the same

529
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,600
question in both cases you're asking how

530
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,200
much is it worth to you to take a 01

531
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,480
chance of 0.1% chance of dying yet if

532
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,159
you ask people the first question

533
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,039
question they'd be willing to pay $200

534
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,279
for a cure you ask the second question

535
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,840
you'd have to pay them

536
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:42,360
$100,000 to be in the

537
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,840
study one so there's a 5,000 fold

538
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,039
difference between what people or five

539
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,400
500 fold difference between these two

540
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,520
framings and the only difference in

541
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
framing is the endowment effect so

542
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,919
obviously this is a clear thing we

543
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,960
should ultimately want to build into our

544
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,720
models the problem is it's like the

545
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,279
question as this nice astute question

546
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,600
asked here what's the right time period

547
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,360
here here the question what's the right

548
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,279
endowment how do I think about the

549
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
endowment effect and that's where a lot

550
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,559
of the exciting modeling is going on is

551
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,320
how do I model the endowment people have

552
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,279
what's their reference point is an

553
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,279
important problem that's one example a

554
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,400
second example which is even more

555
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,080
mind-blowing is basically people have

556
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,080
unstable

557
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,799
preferences there was a professor MIT

558
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,679
who ran the following informal

559
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,240
experiment it's never published I can't

560
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,559
I can't guarantee the reports are

561
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,400
reported accurately but I love the story

562
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:31,480
so I'm going to tell it anyway he taught

563
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,200
two class in one day he went to the

564
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,720
first class and he said to the first

565
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,640
class how much would you pay me to sing

566
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,840
a song and he took a survey in the class

567
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,600
he got some demand curve and there was

568
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,520
some average value they pay him let's

569
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,080
say it was

570
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,039
$5 he then to a second class same set of

571
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,240
students and said how much would you pay

572
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:53,000
me not to sing a song he got demand

573
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,039
curve people would pay posit amounts the

574
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,360
average is about

575
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,159
$5 basically the way you ask the

576
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,480
question affects how people feel about

577
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,200
it that is inconsistent what we've

578
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,520
modeled so far that is UN your

579
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,480
preferences are literally determined by

580
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,799
the questions asked welcome to marketing

581
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
okay welcome to advertising any

582
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,240
advertisers tell you duh of course

583
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
that's why we advertise if preferences

584
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,360
were stable we wouldn't advertise we

585
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,760
want to change preferences okay we want

586
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,279
to affect preferences that's why we say

587
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,200
it's the number one best selling that's

588
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,520
why we do all these things okay so

589
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,120
preferences are unstable that's really

590
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,679
mind-blowing because basically um uh

591
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,559
that's says that a framing effect how

592
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,080
you frame things can matter enormously

593
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,919
and that's a lot of what advertising and

594
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,480
politicians and others tried to

595
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,120
do okay third

596
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,120
example statistical

597
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,679
biases this is

598
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,400
probably

599
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,559
um my favorite my favorite fact of

600
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,799
anything I've ever done in research so

601
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,440
the cisal bi the IDE is we like to think

602
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,559
we do uncertainty models that people

603
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,760
understand the uncertainty they face and

604
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:07,400
then how to process it but it turns out

605
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,039
they

606
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,799
don't so for example 80% of drivers

607
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,919
think they're better than average that

608
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,240
is

609
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,080
impossible okay but 80% of drivers think

610
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,640
they're better than average or my fact

611
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,279
from my research I loved was there was a

612
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,960
survey that asked High School seniors

613
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,760
back in the 1980s when smoking was a lot

614
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,600
more prevalent they asked High School

615
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,200
seniors who smoked a pack a day what are

616
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,600
the odds you'll be smoking in five

617
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,720
years of those who said I will be

618
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,120
smoking in five years 72% were smoking 5

619
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,279
years later so on average they did

620
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,200
reasonable prediction of those who said

621
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,760
I will not be smoking 74% we're smoking

622
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
five years later zero predictive ability

623
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,320
because it's just hard to figure it out

624
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,440
it's hard to assess these statistics and

625
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,120
probabilities okay this has enormous

626
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,440
implications it says the teenagers may

627
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,600
not be properly deciding whether to

628
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,840
smoke it turns out if you ask

629
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,480
smokers how bad is smoking for you

630
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,360
actually smokers no actually if anything

631
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,360
smokers slightly overestimate how bad

632
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,559
smoking is for you it's not that smokers

633
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,520
don't know how bad smoking is for you if

634
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,520
anything think it's worse for you than

635
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:16,640
it is but they think they're going to

636
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,840
quit so you have smokers what is the

637
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,240
effect on the average person's length of

638
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,080
life for smoking it turns out by smoking

639
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,360
you shorten your life by seven years

640
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,440
smokers get that a bit right they're

641
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,039
probably bit pessimistic they may say

642
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,799
eight or nine years but if you ask them

643
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:32,440
how how long do you expect to live they

644
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,520
give the population average not a number

645
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,760
eight years lower because they think it

646
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,720
won't affect

647
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,399
them either they'll quit or they're just

648
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,080
superhuman or whatever okay so

649
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:47,480
statistical biases are another example

650
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:50,520
of that okay a fourth example extrinsic

651
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,520
versus intrinsic

652
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:00,240
motivation extrinsic versus intrinsic

653
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,240
motivation

654
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,159
okay for many decisions we make the

655
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,679
right thing to do is

656
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:13,039
obvious and yet we don't do it let's

657
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,720
take the classic example which is

658
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,440
inexpensive generic medication for

659
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,360
life-threatening chronic disease if you

660
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,480
have diabetes you can manage it with if

661
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,600
you have type two diabetes you can

662
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,000
manage with a with a product called

663
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,720
metformin it's a dollar a day pill you

664
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,520
can take that will keep you alive and if

665
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,600
you don't take it you'll die it's not

666
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,960
very complicated okay you won't die

667
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,799
right away you'll eventually lose your

668
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,320
leg and eventually die okay

669
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:42,520
yet a huge share of diabetics do not

670
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,559
take their metformin compliance with

671
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,919
metformin is incredibly

672
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,840
poor now you might think okay people are

673
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,399
uninformed you know whatever you know

674
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,640
nothing's ever 100% but if you run the

675
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:54,600
follow experiment if you say to people

676
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,799
of

677
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,440
diabetes I will should lower your

678
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:03,279
metform cost from a dollar day to zero a

679
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,559
huge share start to take it now think

680
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,840
about that for a

681
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,640
second it is whether you're going to die

682
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,279
or not and you're letting a dollar a day

683
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,799
affect whether you take it and the

684
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,960
answer is not that people are poor it's

685
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,279
that in some sense zero matters in some

686
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,520
sense these signals intrinsic versus

687
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,320
extrinsic motivation matters these

688
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,480
things matter this is sort of combining

689
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,240
the two of sort of framing matters but

690
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:32,200
basically um individuals uh essentially

691
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,480
they have to believe it and that uh the

692
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,039
framing

693
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,039
matters okay let me talk about another

694
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,039
example

695
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,320
defaults this is probably the single

696
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,640
most striking finding in all of

697
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,480
empirical behavioral economics a former

698
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,120
student of mine named Bridget madrian

699
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,279
did a fascinating

700
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,840
study when you go to join your firm when

701
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,080
you got to get your job you get a good

702
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,679
job you'll sign up there'll be a

703
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,240
benefits package and they'll be like do

704
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,720
you want health insurance do you want a

705
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,440
401k and as I sold to you should check

706
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,640
yes you should put your money away stop

707
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,960
partying save your money for your future

708
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,960
okay you can still party too you can

709
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,279
afford do both okay

710
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,600
now if you look at most firms most new

711
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:17,519
workers young workers do not choose the

712
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,159
401K about 20% of young workers sign up

713
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,200
initially eventually time they're older

714
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,360
it rises towards like 80% but initially

715
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,679
it's about

716
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:29,480
20% so Bridget had a firm studied a firm

717
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,000
that made one simple

718
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,440
change they said we're going to roll you

719
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,440
in the 401K unless you check here saying

720
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,960
you don't want to be in it literally

721
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,880
they just change check if you want to be

722
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,320
in to check if you want to be out the

723
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,799
participation rate among young people

724
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,399
went from 20% to

725
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,880
80% with one wording change okay that

726
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,559
can simply not be explained by anything

727
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,640
we've learned in 1401 so far at least

728
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,960
before today okay there's simply no

729
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,360
rational model of the world

730
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,440
of any type which would justify that

731
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,679
okay the answer is that PE that things

732
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,000
like presentation and defaults matter

733
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,919
and once again that needs to be built

734
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,799
into our

735
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,440
models okay now why is this that's where

736
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,200
you got to take 1413 what where the

737
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,919
thing the place where Behavior economics

738
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,080
is right now is we've documented a huge

739
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,880
set of these what we call anomalies a

740
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,559
huge set of strange examples that are

741
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,519
Inc consistent with our standard

742
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,279
model where we're struggling and where

743
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,760
we need more work and where 1430 can

744
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,679
help you is how do you write the correct

745
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,960
models to explain

746
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,000
those okay how do you write the correct

747
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,960
model to explain those and so for

748
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,960
example this defaults matter 401K thing

749
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,720
could be a procrastination story it

750
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,440
could be a lack of attention story

751
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,480
there's lots of stories you can tell how

752
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
do we write the right models and

753
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,880
distinguish them that's what the

754
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,120
exciting cutting edges in behavioral

755
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,880
economics okay question about any of

756
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,039
these examples I realized I went fast

757
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,039
but question about any of this

758
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,320
yeah perspective like I know America

759
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,440
like if you want to be a heart donor

760
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,799
they like op you out versus like other

761
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,720
countries op you do you know why that is

762
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,399
that's a that's a great point a perfect

763
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,679
example Oregon donations you're

764
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,200
defaulted in in other countries in

765
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,399
America you have to sign up they have

766
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,840
organization rights that are dwarf ours

767
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:22,000
there's no good reason other than

768
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,320
individual Freedom uh but this is what's

769
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,519
this is a great segue other

770
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,799
questions that's a great segue to the

771
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,440
last thing I wanted to talk about

772
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,159
which is what does this all imply for

773
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,840
policy where does this all lead us in

774
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:38,480
terms of government

775
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,919
policy and let me talk about a specific

776
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,799
example then speak it out more

777
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,880
generally okay the specific example is

778
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,640
taxation of

779
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,080
cigarettes we talked in the

780
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,559
externalities

781
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,360
lecture about how when there's a

782
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,799
negative consumption

783
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,519
externality you should tax the activity

784
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,840
cigarettes are a classic negative

785
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,320
consumption externality it's been

786
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,600
measured to be around 40 to 50 cents a

787
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:11,799
pack and that suggests that optimal

788
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,279
policy would be to have a 40 to 50 cent

789
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,480
a pack cigarette

790
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,200
tax but that's actually a pretty small

791
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,760
number it turns out and why is it so

792
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,039
small it's so small for an interesting

793
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,320
reason cigarettes have huge

794
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,840
externalities uncovered medical costs

795
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,880
smoker start fires Etc second smok Etc

796
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,440
but it turns out cigarettes have a huge

797
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,039
positive

798
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,000
externality what's the positive

799
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,880
externality well smokers have a

800
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,639
convenient habit of dying at

801
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,279
65 why is that convenient that means

802
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,440
they spent their lifetime paying taxes

803
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,559
and never get collect the retirement

804
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,600
benefits there's a positive that's a

805
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,720
positive externality on us we benefit

806
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,760
from those stupid

807
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,200
smokers because basically they pay all

808
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,360
the taxes we get the benefits that is a

809
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,120
positive externality that's not a

810
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,039
controversial comment it's a purely POS

811
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,679
indeed the tobacco companies in court

812
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,799
have defended themselves by arguing that

813
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,000
smoking has a death

814
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,200
benefit okay they quickly realized that

815
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,559
was a winning argument and went away

816
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,840
from it okay but that is a big reason

817
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,120
why the ex numers is in bigger in fact

818
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,320
if you took out that death F the ex

819
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,519
number is more like two or three dollars

820
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
a pack the reason so big is because

821
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,320
there's this huge financial positive

822
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,039
externality now I worked in Washington

823
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,039
in the Clinton Administration and the

824
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,840
thing I loved about that is economists

825
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,559
are just so much smarter than lawyers we

826
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,840
just whenever I was in a room unless I

827
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,720
was in room with Larry Summers who was

828
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,679
my mentor there I was the smartest guy

829
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,919
in the room because we know how to not

830
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,240
the smartest by IQ but the smartest by

831
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,519
knowing how to think about how to frame

832
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,919
a policy question our whole fields

833
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:52,200
around how to frame policy questions and

834
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,399
we're so good at it except one time

835
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,480
which we had to stand up in front of a

836
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:57,000
room of lawyers and say you know what we

837
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,080
should tax cigarettes less because they

838
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,480
kill people and lawyers looked at me

839
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,080
like you're nuts and I realized I

840
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,120
probably actually was not that the

841
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,159
external math is wrong what was wrong

842
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,840
was the model of smoking was wrong in

843
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:15,000
particular the model of smoking should

844
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,760
incorporate self-control problems there

845
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,519
is vast evidence that smokers suffer

846
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,760
from self-control problems indeed what's

847
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,960
the best what he conly is the best piece

848
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,600
of evidence for self-control problems

849
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,039
not what's in the lab because remember

850
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,960
we believe what people do not what they

851
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,960
say we think the best piece of evidence

852
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,559
for self-control problems is that when

853
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,200
people want to change your behavior they

854
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:37,480
search for commitment

855
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,240
devices for example if you look at all

856
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,760
the recommendation to quit smoking it's

857
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,360
all punish yourself if you smoke leave

858
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,960
your dirty cigarette butts in water so

859
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,159
you have to smell it make a bet with

860
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,080
your friends so that you have to pay

861
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,080
them if you smoke it's all activities

862
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,159
where you punish yourself if you

863
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,120
smoke that is not consistent with a

864
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,519
rational model in a rational model you

865
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,279
never punish yourself for some future

866
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,600
act you just wouldn't do the future

867
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,960
act the fact that people punish those

868
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,039
for future Act is exactly cons people

869
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,040
knowing they have a self-control problem

870
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,320
perhaps the best example this is syrup

871
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,560
ofac syrup aipac is something you drink

872
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,280
so that if you consume alcohol you

873
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,679
vomit why would anyone do this because

874
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,200
they think they know they're alcoholics

875
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,399
and they can't stop consuming alcohol

876
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,200
it's like painting my nails with that

877
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:25,359
shitty stuff okay sikac is totally

878
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,079
unjustified by any rational model but

879
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,320
it's justified by a self-control model

880
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,879
which is I know I can't stop drinking so

881
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,320
I'm going to stop myself from drinking

882
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,879
by setting up the self-control device

883
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,079
this commitment

884
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:40,560
device okay and that is evidence that

885
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,560
basically um people want have

886
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,639
self-control problems well here's the

887
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,520
thing as I said the AL tax on cigarettes

888
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,599
with this model the exponential model is

889
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,440
50 cents a pack with this

890
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,679
model it's $10 a

891
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,520
pack why because cigarettes are so bad

892
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:01,200
for your health

893
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,920
every pack of cigarettes every cigarette

894
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,400
you smoke lowers your life by seven

895
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,119
minutes if you take

896
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,240
that and multiply by the value of life

897
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,040
that implies the Damage Done by a pack

898
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,000
of cigarettes if you take Economist

899
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,760
estimat the value of a life is about $40

900
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,240
a pack that is you lower your health by

901
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,800
$40 a

902
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,560
pack so if if none of that's a mistake

903
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,119
if you're perfectly rational then that's

904
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,160
irrelevant in the per AC doesn't matter

905
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,160
what you're doing yourself you've made a

906
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,000
decision you know that but what if you

907
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,920
don't get it right then it counts then

908
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,640
we don't just care about externalities

909
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,880
but also internalities what my co-author

910
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,560
and I label internalities

911
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,240
which are the fact that the fact you're

912
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,400
harming yourself does matter in a

913
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,079
standard econic model the fact you're

914
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,839
harming yourself doesn't matter but once

915
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,599
you make this minor tweak which is once

916
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:56,200
again consistent with every experiment

917
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,319
ever run in the history of

918
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,680
psychology suddenly it does matter and

919
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:01,560
it matters a lot for government policies

920
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,800
the optimal tax goes from 50 cents a

921
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,760
pack to $10 a pack now is $10 exactly

922
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,720
right no but the point is that inter

923
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,760
once internalities matter that up put a

924
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,599
whole puts up a whole new space to think

925
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,720
about policy think about the fact that

926
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:20,319
policies which hurt people um uh might

927
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,400
actually even if they don't hurt even on

928
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:26,079
externalities might be things we want to

929
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,640
address so for example so

930
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,760
basically this comes back to thinking

931
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,079
about the policy inies we talked about

932
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,760
last time for health

933
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,480
externalities and we talked about why

934
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,280
would you ever ban a

935
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,480
drug well this is why you'd never want

936
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,319
to make a drug illegal if all we car

937
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,960
about was externalities that is

938
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:52,520
absolutely right there's no externality

939
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,880
argument given the benefits and costs

940
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,960
for making drugs illegal not no but if

941
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,240
you do the math it's hard to justify

942
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,079
okay I don't be too strong it's hard to

943
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,079
justify but once you permit

944
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,480
internalities then it becomes easy to

945
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,520
justify once you say the people doing

946
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,880
those drugs are making

947
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,920
mistakes it's easier to justify so the

948
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,040
fact that we as a society ban drugs

949
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,240
means we Society believe in

950
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,760
internalities

951
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,599
okay we believe that these kinds of

952
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,319
inconsistent decisions are being made

953
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:26,400
all these kinds of various behavioral

954
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:28,359
problems exist and when all these exist

955
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,800
then suddenly we we need to consider the

956
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:31,920
fact that internalities might matter as

957
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,720
well and that's a new ball

958
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,359
game now what's

959
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,440
interesting is that the internalities

960
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,680
versus

961
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,000
externalities

962
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:47,200
debate plays out very

963
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,800
differently in different spaces so let's

964
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,800
take smoking versus

965
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,560
drinking it turns out the internals from

966
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,240
drinking are not very large you have to

967
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,480
be a really really serious alcoholic do

968
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,760
major health damage to

969
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,960
yourself okay whereas the ex from

970
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,240
drinking are enormous as I said 12,000

971
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,480
people a year die in drunk driving

972
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,079
accidents 50% of all violent crimes are

973
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,960
linked to consumption of

974
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,359
alcohol okay 50% of domestic a huge

975
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,079
share of domestic abuse is L cons

976
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,680
alcohol alcohol is huge externalities

977
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,520
probably pretty modest internalities

978
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,640
so any Economist who believes who didn't

979
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,599
believe in this stuff even they like

980
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,520
1401 believe we should tax alcohol more

981
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:33,480
alcohol is vastly under taxed it is

982
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,920
quite frankly and my kid is upset that

983
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,240
every time I say this it is insane that

984
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,319
you can get a beer for the same price as

985
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,640
a Diet

986
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:44,920
Coke okay that makes no sense at

987
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,440
all okay basically there are external

988
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,599
damages done by now you might say but

989
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,400
wait a second

990
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,079
John I drink sucessfully in my dorm room

991
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,160
I might stumble from one dorm to another

992
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,440
but I'm not driving I'm not committing

993
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,440
crimes I'm not domestic abuse lay off

994
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,880
buddy to which I say to you remember

995
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,640
we're talking about is the cost to you

996
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,440
of paying maybe 20 cents more a beer

997
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,960
versus the benefit to Society of maybe a

998
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,960
few thousand people less dying in drunk

999
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,040
driving accidents and less domestic

1000
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,520
abuse less

1001
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,560
crime and ultimately we want to use a

1002
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,000
social welfare function to evaluate that

1003
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,960
but for most social welfare functions

1004
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,079
that's a trade-off worth making now is

1005
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,400
it worth five bucks a beer of tax

1006
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,040
probably not is it worth some absolutely

1007
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,280
okay and so that's how we think about

1008
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,200
that okay but with cigarettes it's

1009
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,599
harder because social economics doesn't

1010
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,319
work you need more internality arguments

1011
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,599
to make that now let's talk about let's

1012
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:43,839
conclude by talking about what I said is

1013
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,400
the most

1014
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,880
significant Health externality and also

1015
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,720
internality today which is

1016
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,920
obesity as I said about 35% of our

1017
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,359
country is obese in some states it

1018
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,440
approaches 50%

1019
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:03,640
obesity has both internalities and

1020
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,599
externalities the externalities arise

1021
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,599
because there's enormous medical cost

1022
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,240
associated with obesity in particular

1023
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,720
through the fact that obesity causes

1024
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,520
diabetes type two and diabetes type two

1025
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,440
is incredibly expensive to treat the

1026
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,240
country of Mexico spends 1.1% of its

1027
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,160
entire GDP treating the complications

1028
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,319
from

1029
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,640
diabetes okay think about that one every

1030
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:26,960
$100 earned in Mexico more than that

1031
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,880
goes to just the complication of

1032
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,599
diabetes

1033
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,560
this is an enormous health problem it's

1034
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,160
a huge uh Health expenditure for our

1035
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,440
country and at the same time there's

1036
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,400
also internalities

1037
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,520
people don't have self-control around

1038
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,359
eating okay and so anytime you don't

1039
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,560
have self-control once again what's

1040
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,960
amazing about that model is just a

1041
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,960
little bit of lack of self-control the

1042
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,960
tobacco cost said if there's big damage

1043
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,359
to your sell from eating too much a

1044
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,359
little bit of lack of self-control can

1045
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:01,839
cause a big effect internality

1046
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:03,760
so obesity causes both externalities in

1047
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,599
medical SP internalities being obese

1048
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,880
lowers your life expectancy by something

1049
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,960
other over four years it's not as bad as

1050
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,839
smoking but it's pretty bad so basically

1051
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,839
it's both externalities and

1052
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,440
internalities so what do we do about it

1053
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:18,000
well this is as I said where it gets

1054
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,599
hard the first thing we do that's

1055
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,680
obvious that anybody who believes in

1056
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,920
anything would say it's more information

1057
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,480
that's a clear one we should explain to

1058
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,760
people like things like nutritional

1059
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,680
calorie labeling fun fact about Cal I

1060
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,640
talked to one of the guys who was an

1061
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,599
owner of Dunkin Donuts says fast what

1062
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,079
happen they label calories they label

1063
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,920
calories of Dunkin Donuts doughnut

1064
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:39,720
consumption didn't change at

1065
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,800
all muffin consumption fell

1066
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,599
enormously why who knew muffins were

1067
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,359
like 500 calories each you know a

1068
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,040
Doughnut's bad for you but you don't

1069
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:50,200
realize a muffin that seems okay it's

1070
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,440
twice as bad as a doughnut nobody knew

1071
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,040
that so basically information matters

1072
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,359
okay so information is an obvious step

1073
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,319
but it's not enough we can do do

1074
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:02,520
taxation but the problem then is what do

1075
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,200
we tax we can't tax food poor people

1076
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,400
won't be able to eat we could try things

1077
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,160
like taxing sugar

1078
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,240
content okay but then the problem is

1079
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,920
what if they then just substitute

1080
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,119
towards fattier Foods instead of sugier

1081
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,880
foods substitute cigar out tobacco is

1082
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,040
easy you tax tobacco you're done food's

1083
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,800
harder because there's so many bad

1084
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:26,599
components and multiple components and

1085
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:28,520
food okay now really what we want to do

1086
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:32,200
is we'd like to tax body

1087
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,800
weight okay now we can't but in theory

1088
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:38,079
the externality is caused by being

1089
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,240
obese So in theory we could do that in

1090
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,760
practice politically we can't but

1091
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,559
actually in practice it's not obvious

1092
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,480
that would help and the reason not ofice

1093
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,760
it would help is because of self-control

1094
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,119
problems if you tax body weight so

1095
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,920
people in a year have to pay a higher

1096
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,200
tax that might not affect where they

1097
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,440
today whereas a tax on food is right in

1098
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,400
front of them it puts the cost of

1099
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,480
benefits together a tax on body weight

1100
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,400
puts the cost and the benefits future

1101
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,520
and that runs to self-control

1102
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,520
problems okay so that is um another

1103
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,480
solution the other solution just

1104
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,119
regulation so for example most European

1105
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,000
nations and now in the US we we've

1106
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,440
banned trans fats trans fats are

1107
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,520
particularly awful kind of substance

1108
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,559
that is yummy but is very bad for us and

1109
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,680
we have good

1110
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,079
substitutes but once again substitution

1111
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,960
makes that challenging that was an easy

1112
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,040
case because they were good substitute

1113
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,240
were all obviously better so anytime you

1114
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,440
have something where there's all the sub

1115
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,280
suits are obviously better that's easy

1116
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,720
to ban that what about some of the subss

1117
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,359
might be worse for you then that gets

1118
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,599
tricky okay another thing we do is

1119
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,400
regulate Supply a big problem we have in

1120
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,680
America is food deserts they're called

1121
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,680
we're basically the large areas of

1122
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,440
America we can't buy vegetables

1123
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,040
literally within any walking distance

1124
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,400
there's nowhere to buy vegetables with

1125
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,640
any biking distance you have to get in a

1126
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,480
bus and go a long

1127
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,599
way okay so we could solve that by

1128
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,960
making them more available it turns out

1129
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,599
so we could do that making it more

1130
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,119
available now

1131
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,280
it turns out we have tried all of these

1132
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,680
approaches I've

1133
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,520
said in individually and all of them

1134
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,800
work a little bit and none of them make

1135
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,720
a huge difference on

1136
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,440
Obesity the one policy intervention that

1137
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,040
seems to matter a lot comes from

1138
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,119
behavioral economics and it's what we

1139
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,800
call

1140
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,079
nudges which is changing the framework

1141
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,640
in a way where we're not lowering

1142
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,480
welfare because your choice set hasn't

1143
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,359
changed we're just changing the way it's

1144
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,559
presented to you like the default

1145
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:37,000
example so one now let me just say for

1146
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,480
here big caveat any of some of you who

1147
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,920
are I don't know if any of you there's

1148
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,680
there's a huge replication crisis in

1149
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,079
social sciences right now and a lot of

1150
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,680
the studies I'll site have not been

1151
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,800
successfully replicated okay but I

1152
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,520
believe in so much I'm going to tell you

1153
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,359
about them anyway because I think they

1154
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,559
offer some interesting insights but I

1155
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:52,760
just want to be clear on the evidence

1156
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:54,480
there's a there's a big replication

1157
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,040
crisis with these sort of fun nudge

1158
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,400
studies so more needs to be done but for

1159
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,520
for example one of the most famous

1160
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,559
studies was they took people that all

1161
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,040
eaten a meal at the same time put them

1162
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,599
in front of a movie and gave them

1163
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,559
buckets of stale popcorn and the buckets

1164
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,119
were full to different levels a third

1165
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,079
full a half full and full everybody ate

1166
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,160
the entire bucket of what was in their

1167
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,440
bucket okay despite the fact it was

1168
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,920
different amounts they were all equally

1169
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,079
hungry it was just in front of them they

1170
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,359
ate it okay or one study of Professor to

1171
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:24,760
man it's never been publisher so I don't

1172
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:25,720
I once again just a informal story but I

1173
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:30,720
love

1174
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:32,040
it but buffets create huge food waste

1175
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,319
because we all know how Buffet works you

1176
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,040
say first thing say oh that's good you

1177
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:36,440
take a bunch of it next oh that's really

1178
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,760
good you take a bunch of by third thing

1179
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,280
oh yeah I'll squeeze that in the corner

1180
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,160
of the plate because that looks good too

1181
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,359
you don't eat it all so they made a

1182
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,920
simple change of the buffet at her

1183
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:46,119
school they put the plates at the end of

1184
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,240
the row rather than the beginning of the

1185
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,760
row so you had to walk by the buffet to

1186
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,800
get your plate so you knew what was

1187
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,960
there and they lowered food waste by

1188
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,079
20% because people then were like oh

1189
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,280
yeah I know this is coming so I won't

1190
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,240
load up so much on this

1191
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,800
okay these are once again we need more

1192
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,000
study of this but it suggests that the

1193
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,400
way we're really going to ultimately

1194
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,160
deal with problems like this is to lean

1195
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,319
to the behavioral biases that cause them

1196
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,079
if you find this interesting is a book

1197
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,160
called Nudge by the Nobel prize winning

1198
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,880
Economist Richard theor who talks about

1199
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,520
this and talks about the behavioral

1200
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,240
economics behind it and uh and all the

1201
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,400
all the policies behind it but once

1202
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,359
again the politics is hard perhaps the

1203
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,440
best nudge based policy suggestion of

1204
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:29,160
all time

1205
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,119
was what Mayor Bloomberg suggested in

1206
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,880
New York which was to ban large servings

1207
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:37,920
of soda he said look people buy a soda

1208
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,520
you guys don't know when I was a kid

1209
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,800
okay now when you go to buy soda you

1210
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,040
almost never can buy anything less than

1211
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,800
18 ounces and often can't buy some less

1212
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,880
than 24 ounces when I was a kid you the

1213
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,240
choice was typically 12 ounces you can't

1214
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,200
even buy those anymore size have gone up

1215
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,440
so Bloomberg said look let's just ban

1216
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,839
large soda

1217
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,520
sizes therefore Mak people work more to

1218
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,000
have to get those calories brilliant

1219
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,319
idea

1220
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,280
okay uh but the politics was ugly even

1221
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,280
including obviously conservatives appros

1222
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,000
it because it's interfering with the

1223
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,839
free market but liberals opposes too

1224
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,079
John Stewart made fun of him I'll never

1225
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,319
forgive John Stewart for that okay John

1226
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,880
Stewart made fun of me too I'll forgive

1227
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:19,119
him for that either okay but basically

1228
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,440
the bottom line is these behavioral

1229
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,760
nudges matter and we should think

1230
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,359
seriously about incorporating them into

1231
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,319
policy okay I'm going to stop there

1232
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,520
we're going to come back on Wednesday

1233
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:29,720
I'm not going to say I'm not going to

1234
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,800
give the answers to the finals on

1235
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,160
Wednesday I'm just not going to say that

1236
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,280
I'm not not going to give the answers to

1237
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,280
the finals on Wednesday so it's your

1238
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,280
decision whether you want to come or not
