00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,040
I'm Caroline ooler a professor in the

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,920
department of electrical engineering and

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,880
computer science and the institute for

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,639
data systems and Society at MIT and also

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
a core faculty member at the broad

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,720
Institute one of the world's leading

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,279
biomedical research centers at the broad

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,560
I direct the Eric and Wendy Schmid

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,800
Center which seeks to create a two-way

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,400
street between machine learning and

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,160
biology and hi I'm or ashenberg

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,759
associate director of computation

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,680
biology of the claran cell Observatory

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,000
and the B Institute the claran cell

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,879
Observatory is led by Dr romx Xavier and

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,640
for over a decade we have led pioneering

17
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:41,360
efforts to understand how cells work

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,399
together to create healthy tissues and

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,640
how that process unravels during

20
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,079
diseases like autoimmunity and cancer

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,960
and today we want to share with you an

22
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,920
exciting challenge taking place this

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,079
October so the Eric and Wendy Schmid

24
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,280
Center and the clareman cell Observatory

25
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,399
are holding the autoimmune disease

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,399
machine learning challenge we're

27
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,760
collaborating also with Crunch and

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,239
Foundry as well as Harvard's laboratory

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,119
for Innovation science mit's department

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
of electrical engineering and computer

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,520
science and the institute for data

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,320
systems and society and the Mass General

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,040
Hospital Center for the study of

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
inflammatory bowel disease today we're

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,759
here to talk about why we're doing this

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,600
Challenge and also to discuss the

37
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,799
problems at hand we'll talk about

38
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,479
autoimmune diseases where our immune

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,000
system mistakenly attacks our own

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,119
healthy tissues exciting new biological

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,720
data sets that could open novel avenues

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,680
for treating Pat patients with these

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,360
diseases and why we think machine

44
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,960
learning is the key to unlocking the

45
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,119
power of these data we'll also get into

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,200
the challenge itself can you design

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,560
algorithms that identify genes driving

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,960
an autoimmune disease and increasing our

49
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,840
risk of developing cancer now for some

50
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,840
of our viewers it may have been a while

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,280
since biology class in high school or

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,840
college so or let's talk about our

53
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,759
immune system and autoimmune diseases so

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,600
normally when we get sick say with a

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,799
virus our immune system mounts a

56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,320
response resp immune cells travel

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,799
through our body to the site of

58
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,880
infection recognize cells infected by

59
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,840
the virus and destroy those cells this

60
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,400
response protects us against viruses

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,440
bacteria and even cancer right our

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,319
immune system has a remarkable mix of

63
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,360
capabilities both a built-in ability to

64
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,560
recognize features shared across

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,959
thousands of different pathogens and a

66
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,120
learned ability to recognize pathogens

67
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,120
it has never seen before which is what

68
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,599
happened during the covid-19 pandemic

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
however this power comes at a cost the

70
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,360
immune system can mistake our own

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,519
healthy cells and tissues for a pathogen

72
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,680
and attack and kill them this is the

73
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,360
basis of autoimmune disease yeah and

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,959
many of us have family and friends with

75
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
autoimmune diseases such as diabetes or

76
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,000
multiple sclerosis one of the most

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,319
common autoimmune diseases is

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,480
inflammatory bowel disease or IBD IBD is

79
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,040
caused when the barrier between our gut

80
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,159
and the microbes living there breaks

81
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,800
down and as this barrier falls apart our

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,239
immune system attacks both our gut and

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,000
the resident microbes there resulting in

84
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,560
chronic inflammation IBD symptoms are

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
painful and affect quality of life and

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,440
treatments range from steroids all the

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,080
way to surgery to remove the disease gut

88
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,519
tissue to make things worse IBD also

89
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,680
increases the risk of coloral

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,319
cancer over the past 50 years we've made

91
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,680
great progress in treating IBD patients

92
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,799
but we're really not there yet we still

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,000
don't fully understand the steps behind

94
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,920
behind the progression of IBD and

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,519
without this we cannot develop new

96
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,640
therapies or detect and treat coloral

97
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,680
cancer earlier so how can we reach these

98
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,959
critical goals so first let's talk with

99
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,959
a pathologist about how IBD is

100
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,840
diagnosed I'm Dr Angela shei an

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,760
assistant in pathology at Mass General

102
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Hospital and an assistant professor in

103
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,040
pathology at Harvard Medical School as a

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,640
pathologist who specializes in

105
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,560
gastrointestin illnesses my role is to

106
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,000
accurately diagnose whether a patient

107
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,720
has IBD how severe their disease may be

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,400
and whether or not they have developed

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,959
secondary complications this information

110
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,840
guides the therapeutic approaches

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,079
doctors choose to manage their patients

112
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,759
disease and so how do you make the

113
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,199
correct diagnosis it all starts with

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,440
examining very small pieces of tissue or

115
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,280
biopsies that are taken throughout the

116
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,680
grro intestinal tract from a patient

117
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,160
during an endoscopy procedure this

118
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,479
tissue undergos process processing in

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,560
the laboratory that allows us to cut a

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,080
very thin five Micron tissue section

121
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,320
that is stained with two routine

122
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,039
chemicals hematoxilin which stains

123
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,800
nuclear material blue and eosin which

124
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,560
stains the cells cytoplasm pink this

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,080
processing allows us to visually

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,639
evaluate the composition and

127
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,840
architecture of the cells that are

128
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,960
making up the

129
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,800
gut here we are looking at a hematoxilin

130
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,800
and ESN stained image or h& image for

131
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,080
short of the healthy adult colon the

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,720
staining reveals four distinct layers of

133
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,080
the gut each with a specific function

134
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,000
the inner layer is the mucosa which is

135
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,199
the layer that comes into contact with

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,120
digested food passing through our gut

137
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,520
and is very important for absorbing

138
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,000
nutrients and water this layer is

139
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,080
supported by a subjacent sub mucosa

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
third is a thick smooth muscle layer

141
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,560
called the muscularis propria which

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,880
helps with peristalsis and pushing food

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,759
through the gut lastly there is the

144
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,960
outer advant tial layer with a sosal

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,880
surface right but how does each layer

146
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
work well each layer is highly organized

147
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,199
and does a lot for example the mucose is

148
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,919
divided into the epithelial compartment

149
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,919
the lamin apropriate compartment which

150
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,319
contains inflammatory cells and the

151
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,479
muscularis mucosa beneath it the

152
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,400
epithelium forms beautiful cryp

153
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,360
structures that have stem cells at their

154
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,160
base all of which continually

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,840
differentiate into cells that absorb

156
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,919
nutrients or cells that secrete

157
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,160
important signal

158
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,680
now as a pathologist I have looked at

159
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,160
thousands of these h& images during my

160
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,319
training and clinical practice and so my

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,880
eyes are quickly drawn to the pathologic

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,720
features in these tissues here we are

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,080
looking at a colon tissue from a patient

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,880
with ulcerative kitis the most common

165
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,400
form of IBD and what you will work on in

166
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,280
this challenge you can immediately see

167
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
how much the gut tissue changes during

168
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,759
ulcerative colitis we see dramatic

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,440
differences in the tissue layers their

170
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,120
anatomical structure structures and the

171
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,479
individual cells when I diagnose ulcer

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,039
of colitis I look for several features

173
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,280
for example here I see distortions in

174
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,400
the cry morphology and here I see an

175
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,880
infiltration of immune cells including

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,800
neutrophils remember inflammatory bowel

177
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,599
disease is an autoimmune disease so the

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,919
arrival of these immune cells makes a

179
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,720
lot of sense I don't just use these

180
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,400
images of the gut to diagnose IBD I also

181
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,800
use them to look for warning sides of

182
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,120
cancer as the risk for coloral cancer

183
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,160
can be up to two fold higher in I

184
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,160
patients here we see low-grade dysplasia

185
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,120
which are abnormal epithelial cells in

186
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,560
the gut that may develop into cancer

187
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,680
depending on the severity of the

188
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,919
dysplasia we may try to remove the

189
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,039
tissue through an endoscopy procedure or

190
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,639
even remove larger portions of the colon

191
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,479
to prevent cancer improved understanding

192
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,319
of dysplasia could lead to earlier

193
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,560
detection and more informed patient

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,599
management

195
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,240
decisions so routine h& images have been

196
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,039
analyzed by Pathologists for hundreds of

197
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,479
years

198
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,080
but I think it's important to recognize

199
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,199
that there are limitations to what we do

200
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,479
so for example all we can really tell

201
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,840
you is the activity of a disease at a

202
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,360
certain point in time what we cannot

203
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,720
inform clinicians and patients is how

204
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,000
they might respond to specific

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,599
treatments or how they might actually go

206
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,879
on to develop secondary complications I

207
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,280
think that this is a new future Horizon

208
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,479
for pathology and integrating what we

209
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,159
see on histologic findings with

210
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,599
additional molecular biology and

211
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:04,080
computational methods to really have an

212
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,080
impact on the treatment of patient

213
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,360
diseases so to summarize Dr sheor

214
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,319
Pathologists guide the care of IBD

215
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,720
patients by analyzing tissue from the

216
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,080
inflamed gut they stain this tissue with

217
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,720
special dyes which reveal the spatial

218
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,319
organization and anatomical features of

219
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,319
cells in the gut during IBD these

220
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,440
changed dramatically in Telltale

221
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,919
patterns allowing a diagnosis to be made

222
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,599
such h& images of the gut are rely

223
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,240
collected in hospitals around the world

224
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,000
resulting in a data set of potentially

225
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,039
millions of images while such images

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,240
have guided patient care for decades we

227
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,680
are ultimately using known patterns in

228
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,240
the tissue to label the diseases in

229
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,120
these images right but how can we

230
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,279
identify more powerful markers of early

231
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,560
cancer so that we can detect cancer

232
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,040
earlier than Pathologists can currently

233
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,560
do or how can we better understand who

234
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,120
will respond to which therapy or even

235
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,320
ultimately develop new Therapies

236
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,600
for this we need to be able to translate

237
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,839
from the morphology of a cell which we

238
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,640
can observe in an h& image to the

239
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,760
internal functional state of a cell

240
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,200
given by the activity of our

241
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,000
genes so we each have 20,000 genes in

242
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,160
each of our cells and distinct groups of

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,040
these genes are activated together to

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,360
carry out the programs within a cell now

245
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,360
during disease hundreds of these genes

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,079
change their activity and drive

247
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,480
dysfunctional changes in the tissue

248
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,279
therefore identifying the alter Gene

249
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
programs can highlight new targets for

250
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,120
therapeutic intervention and allow us to

251
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,880
pinpoint earlier any transition to

252
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,279
cancer so given how important they are

253
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,720
how can we measure these Gene

254
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,000
programs unfortunately this is not a

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,480
measurement typically made by

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,360
Pathologists and even when they do they

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
measure at most two or three genes but

258
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,360
ideally we'd like to measure thousands

259
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,920
and this is really where large- scale

260
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,959
data sets and machine learning come in

261
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,360
the life sciences are in the midst of a

262
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,480
data Revolution where it is now possible

263
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,560
to accurately and in very inexpensive

264
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,079
ways do large-scale DNA sequencing where

265
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,200
we have advanced molecular Imaging and

266
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,920
single cell Technologies allow measuring

267
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,680
the activity of all 20,000 genes

268
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,440
simultaneously in single cells for 1

269
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,600
million cells per experiment in addition

270
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,120
over the last 10 years there has been a

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,800
really exciting development new

272
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,079
technologies many of which have been

273
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,680
developed here at the broad have made

274
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,880
spatial genomics a reality right so

275
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,959
while single cell Technologies require

276
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,000
isolating single cells from the tissue

277
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,720
context spatial genomics Technologies

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,560
allow us to measure the activity of

279
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,000
genes directly within the tissue context

280
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,800
giving rise to a very high content and

281
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,079
high resolution view of a tissue these

282
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,760
Innovations in the massive data sets

283
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,800
they produce have really brought us to a

284
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,079
new era in biom medicine our ability to

285
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,399
generate data is rapidly outpacing our

286
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,880
ability to analyze and interpret it to

287
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,519
give you a better idea a single lab can

288
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,079
generate a data set that Rivals and size

289
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,600
the entire movie library of Netflix here

290
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,480
at the broad just the genomics platform

291
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,600
alone generated 100 pedabytes of data

292
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,720
last year which is 100 million gigabytes

293
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,480
put simply we have reached the limits of

294
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,880
uned human

295
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,720
comprehension but fortunately the last

296
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,399
two decades have witnessed not only a

297
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,079
transformation of the life sciences but

298
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,279
also the data Sciences as we all know

299
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,920
we're living in the Golden Age of AI and

300
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,720
machine learning but unlike in the more

301
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,360
traditional applications of machine

302
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,079
learning and AI like recommender systems

303
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,440
or online advertising in the biomedical

304
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,880
Sciences the ultimate goal is often to

305
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,880
understand the underlying mechanisms for

306
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,079
example in our autoimmune disease

307
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,680
machine learning challenge we want to

308
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,760
comprehensively identify Gene programs

309
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,200
in IBD by connecting tissue images

310
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,760
collected by Pathologists to this high

311
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,959
resolution view of genes active in the

312
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,320
tissue afforded by spatial genomics and

313
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,680
we want to identify genes that Mark

314
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,760
potential cancerous regions in the G so

315
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,120
the mechanistic aspect is really

316
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,040
important for this application the

317
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,240
tissue images processed by Pathologists

318
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,800
are cheap to collect and number in the

319
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,240
millions worldwide in contrast spatial

320
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,720
genomics data sets where we measure

321
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,440
genes directly in the tissue are

322
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,320
difficult to collect very expensive and

323
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,079
number less than 100 for IBD linking

324
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,160
these different data modalities would

325
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,240
give us the best of both worlds the

326
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,639
intricate spatial organization of the

327
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,199
gut tissue provided by pathology with

328
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,320
the detailed Gene programs provided by

329
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,560
genomics but how can we translate

330
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,680
between these two modalities this is

331
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,199
exactly where you and your algorithms

332
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,160
come into our machine learning challenge

333
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:04,880
to identify Gene programs from IBD

334
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,839
tissue images and discover genes that

335
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,839
Mark the progression of IBD to

336
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,160
cancer to make this happen we've

337
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,480
collected eight spatial genomics data

338
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,720
sets from the gut tissue of patients

339
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,639
with and without IBD and we measur the

340
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,320
activity of 480 genes across hundreds of

341
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,040
thousands of cells in these tissues from

342
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,040
these very same tissue regions Dr shei

343
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,399
performed pathology analysis and

344
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,680
prepared h& images so that means for

345
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,560
these a tissue regions we can see how

346
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,199
the twocc color h& image translates to

347
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,120
the 480 color image that measures the

348
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,240
activity of 480 GS but of course you

349
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,079
remember we said that each of our cells

350
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,480
has 20,000 genes so what about the

351
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,040
missing

352
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,440
19,500 genes that we never measured

353
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,519
unfortunately current spatial gen ICS

354
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,079
technology still aren't able to measure

355
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,720
the activity of all our genes at single

356
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,279
cell resolution together with h& images

357
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,120
in the same tissue region but we will

358
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,639
provide you with single cell data

359
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,560
collected from IBD patients where we

360
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,680
measure the activity of all 20,000 genes

361
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,600
but at the cost of losing the location

362
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,839
of the individual cells in the

363
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,639
tissue now given these training data the

364
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,480
challenge is to design the algorithms

365
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,240
that can predict the activity of all

366
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,000
20,000 genes given the tissue images

367
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,800
from Pathologists or in other words

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,920
translate from a two color h& image

369
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,600
taken from an IBD patient to a 20,000

370
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,800
color image of that same tissue region

371
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,959
which predicts the activity of each gene

372
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,160
in each cell in the tissue region this

373
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:53,279
will allow us to identify distinct

374
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,959
groups of genes that are altered in IBD

375
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,120
as well as in the transition to cancer

376
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,160
most importantly this will provide new

377
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,639
candidate Gene markers for the early

378
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,600
detection of dysplasia and thus early

379
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,210
cancer detection as well as new

380
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,240
potential targets for therapeutic

381
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,399
[Music]

382
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,480
interventions so here is the exact

383
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,519
breakdown of the challenge in part one

384
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,040
you will predict the activity of genes

385
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,600
from pathologist tissue images and we

386
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,920
will evaluate you on the held out sets

387
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,800
of tissue regions and genes to help you

388
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,880
develop your algorithms we will provide

389
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,000
you with your algorithms performance on

390
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,759
a validation set of tissue regions in

391
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,199
part two you will propose new genes that

392
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,160
based on your algorithms would boost our

393
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:42,839
ability to distinguish gut tissue

394
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,560
regions with dysplasia from those

395
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,000
without finally in part three you will

396
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,880
come up with a new metric for ranking

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,120
how well a set of genes identifies

398
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,440
displasia and we're really excited to

399
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,959
announce something unique to this

400
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,480
challenge which is that the top scores

401
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,480
from part one will have the G means they

402
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,040
identify as marking dysplasia

403
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,720
experimentally validated in the lab so

404
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,880
you can get to see how well your

405
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,399
algorithms actually perform in

406
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,360
identifying regions of IBD tissue that

407
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,519
could develop into cancer now note that

408
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,720
a biology background isn't needed to

409
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,759
participate the Eric and Wendy Schmid

410
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,120
Center will provide all challenge

411
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,519
participants with a short online crash

412
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,440
course the broad Institute is a global

413
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,720
leader in biomedical research

414
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,480
particularly in genetic sequencing so

415
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,600
this this is really a unique opportunity

416
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,800
to learn from leading life science and

417
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,880
computational biology experts the crash

418
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,959
course will take you through the biology

419
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,720
of our immune systems and IBD and how

420
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,360
Pathologists diagnose IBD in patients

421
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,759
you'll also learn more about the

422
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,920
technology that we use to generate the

423
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
spatial and single cell genomics data

424
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,279
sets from the gut that you'll be working

425
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,519
with the crash course will give you an

426
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,519
introduction to the biases of these

427
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,440
types of data and how to work with the

428
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,040
data you'll be well prepared for the

429
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:07,319
challenge at hand now the challenge will

430
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,079
run from October 2024 to January 2025

431
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,120
you can sign up as individual or a team

432
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,959
and we'll be giving out monetary prizes

433
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,600
to the winners of each part of the

434
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,120
challenge totaling

435
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,319
$50,000 the top algorithms will be

436
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,880
presented in the resulting

437
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,919
Publications now another great product

438
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,319
of this challenge is that the resulting

439
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,600
data algorithms and code from The

440
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,160
Challenge will be made open source for

441
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,520
the community to use we will also be

442
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,960
adding to these spatial data sets as new

443
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,559
experiments and data become available

444
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,039
and we would love for you to remain

445
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,960
engaged in this problem even after the

446
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,320
completion of this particular

447
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,919
challenge to achieve the goals of this

448
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,600
challenge we're going to need new ideas

449
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,440
new ideas that break through the bounds

450
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,640
of the traditional approaches that

451
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,559
address the most pressing questions and

452
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,760
ultimately help us intersect machine

453
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,240
learning with Biology so so not only

454
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,159
will you get to do something you love

455
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,200
but your algorithms could change the

456
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,720
course of how we diagnose and treat

457
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,679
IBD if you haven't already register now

458
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,679
we're very excited to be working with

459
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,679
you
