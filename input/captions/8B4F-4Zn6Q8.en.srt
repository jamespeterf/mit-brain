00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,839
Thank you for the opportunity to present

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,120
my company, Borite. Uh my name is Pavl

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:13,120
Biski. I'm the co-founder and CEO of

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,000
Boronite and I'm an alum of the MIT

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,720
material science department. Um we

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,520
started Boronite 10 years ago and the

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,359
goal initially was to develop commercial

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,000
scale technology for producing boron

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,519
nitride nanot tubes. Uh hence the name

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,640
boronite.

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,040
But the technology is versatile. we can

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
use the same reactors to synthesize

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,239
carbon nanot tubes and boron nitrate

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,320
nanot tubes. So today I will talk about

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:46,079
electrical conductors. Uh the need that

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,480
we see uh that is worldwide is for

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,239
better conductive solutions. uh

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,360
electrification needs are growing

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:58,000
exponentially especially with u uh the

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,160
the new data center needs and um legacy

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,680
materials like copper and aluminum are

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,080
really inadequate. Uh copper is really

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,760
heavy. uh the mechanical properties are

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,479
insufficient and so our solution is to

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,880
use the carbon nanot tube technology

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,960
that we have developed to create the

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,080
next generation of electrical

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,720
conductors. Uh in the reactors that we

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,280
built, we spin carbon nanotubarn

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,240
straight out of the reactor. So these

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,000
it's like spinning fiber from smoke

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,040
essentially.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,280
These nanotubarn are the strongest

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
material known. They are in terms of

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
mechanical properties, they already

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,840
compete with the best carbon fiber

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,560
available and they're pretty good

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
electrical conductors. But for power

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,079
applications that we target, uh we need

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,079
better conductivity. Uh so we have a

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,560
patented technology to metalize the CNT

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,880
yarn to improve conductivity while

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:05,360
keeping really good very low weight and

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,360
really strong mechanical properties.

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,319
Uh this is the facility that we have

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,920
built here in Burlington, Massachusetts.

47
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,160
uh here you see the uh the reactors

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
uh where we synthesize either boron

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
nitride nanot tubes or carbon nanot

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,280
tubes it's as I said same hardware but

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:30,400
different chemistry and then uh in

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,480
we we also have hardware here uh to uh

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,080
post-process the material into these

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,280
better conductors uh this was built with

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,160
financial support from uh many uh

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,800
government government contracts.

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,319
So, uh the technology that we have

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,280
developed uh I'll show you an example of

59
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:57,519
a power cable uh built with these uh

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:03:02,480
materials. Um this is a u conductor that

61
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,959
uh was tested to more than 500 amps. Uh

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,760
and to give you an idea, so this is a

63
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,680
quarter inch cable 4T long. To give you

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,560
an idea of the disruptive potential of

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,080
this technology, this is 96% weight

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,760
savings over an equivalent uh commercial

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,760
cable that is rated 500 amps.

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,760
And um so the uh

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,720
see there we uh the markets that we're

70
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,360
pursuing uh initially before we're able

71
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,519
to fully scale up uh we're looking at

72
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,440
any uh any markets uh where technology

73
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,720
needs to uh achieve ex extreme weight

74
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,400
savings. So, uh, uh, electric aircraft

75
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,360
and spacecraft, UAVs. We're currently,

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,440
uh, building a 600 ft, uh, power cable

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,319
for a powered drone for the Navy that

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,080
will be tested next year. And then when

79
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,640
we scale up the technology, we'll be

80
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,400
targeting electric motor windings, uh,

81
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,319
where weight savings are also really

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,840
important. And really the killer

83
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,319
application is electric power lines. Uh

84
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,840
power transmission lines where uh

85
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
building new corridors is really

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,759
expensive, very difficult with

87
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,280
regulation

88
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,800
um and uh to to to build these new

89
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,600
corridors. And so with this technology,

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,560
we can reconductor existing corridors,

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,440
improve and double uh potentially double

92
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,280
the transmission capacity uh without

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,040
having to build new corridors. So we

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,639
welcome partnerships. I would like to

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
talk with anyone interested in this

96
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,960
technology. We have a booth next door.

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,960
Thank you.
