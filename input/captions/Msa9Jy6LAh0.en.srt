1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,879
hi everybody I'm Blair dwit uh founder

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,639
of Lunar Station we're based here in

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,320
Cambridge and we're an MIT startup uh we

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,360
organized in

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,000
2016 and at the time of organizing what

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,680
we wanted to do for the Aerospace Market

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,119
was to solve the data problem of the

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,240
Moon uh what we quickly heard from

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,800
industry was that there was plenty of

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,119
data but there wasn't a lot of

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,480
insights and so when we thought about it

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,239
like okay

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,719
this is the data structure in NASA's

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,200
planetary data system it's a pi Le

15
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,079
architecture and we quickly understood

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,600
why aerospace companies were having

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,719
trouble just accessing the volume of

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,360
data about the moon that's already

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,239
existed so we set about to create

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,800
systems that could go into the planetary

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,239
data system in all the various nodes

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,920
extract and ingest that data fuse it and

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,120
produce

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,960
insights and that's how Moon hacker came

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,759
into existence with moon hacker we have

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,840
a way of characterizing the Moon in new

27
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:14,479
ways and we can help our customers with

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,560
site selection surface uh Transit

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,520
Mobility Solutions minerology and

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,520
minerology heat mapping we also get into

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,320
the astrodynamics where's the Sun going

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,320
to be where's Earth that affects your

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,320
power and comms we also get into

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,079
environmentals what are The Thermals

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,000
what are the rain es of those thermals

36
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,439
what are the meteorite interactions with

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,560
the surface and your area of operation

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,159
going to be and then finally radiation

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,079
how much exposure are you going to have

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,680
because you're farther away from all the

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,680
shielding and another Discovery was that

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,360
clients had a lot of radiation questions

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,360
and understanding that radiation testing

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,600
is critical because you get to figure

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,920
out how your survive what's your

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,520
availability of the equipment uh

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,039
establishes costs can you buy CS rad

48
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,479
hard equipment or do you have to build

49
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,800
your own and also a side note for anyone

50
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,280
working on government contracts it is

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,040
required for your PDR and

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,480
CDR the problem with this is that the

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,560
national rad lab infrastructure is

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,640
challenged uh we were on the phone with

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,120
a DOD Branch uh talking last week about

56
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,239
an 18-month delay now the workforce is

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,239
aging it's not being replenished fast

58
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:35,519
enough and there's a backlog so we had a

59
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,080
client who's ready to launch but they

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:43,000
haven't gotten their rad lab uh

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,239
certified so we were able to put their

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,280
system in our

63
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,120
simulator and move them along in the

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,200
process so that they can actually meet

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,599
their launch

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,640
window and the way we go about doing our

67
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,680
radiation simulator is first we create a

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,360
digital

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,440
twin the dimensions the material

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,799
the

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,440
shielding and from there where you going

72
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,680
to go cuz this is not exclusive to the

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,519
surface of the Moon orbiting the Moon it

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,760
is anywhere in space so our client being

75
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,599
an Advan propulsion system here in the

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,400
Boston area it was all over the place

77
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,400
because they're actually an engine that

78
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,599
will take you from uh any kind of cargo

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,519
or uh payload from one place in space to

80
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,959
another so there was a lot of different

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,480
places they needed to make sure they

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,519
could operate without any critical

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,480
failure once we know where your place in

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,560
space is we said about in the

85
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,799
bombardment this bombardment can be ours

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,799
but we've had clients ask us for two

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,680
decades worth of bombardment and this

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,280
bombardments uh influenced and modeled

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,720
after Advanced particle research

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,360
facilities like CERN firery and here at

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,040
MIT once the bombardment is done we can

92
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,599
then tabulate all those results

93
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,640
looking at dosage

94
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,159
exposures CES or single event upsets but

95
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,920
ultimately what the client really wants

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,680
to know is what's a lifetime expectancy

97
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
and are there any critical parts that

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,160
will take my system

99
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,040
down and then we can make modifications

100
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,320
to the digital twin as Corrections are

101
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,160
made and run it through again without

102
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,680
leaning on any challenged infrastructure

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,160
in the nation for physical red lab a

104
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,759
funny thing also happened along the way

105
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,919
when we were were characterizing the

106
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,199
moon we saw symmetry in how underwater

107
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,880
domain is also developing a lot of

108
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,840
autonomy a lot of data generation not a

109
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,479
lot of

110
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,919
intelligence um so what's interesting is

111
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,840
is that the moon actually is better

112
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,320
mapped than the ocean the moon has

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,479
better resolution if you could believe

114
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,280
it and more thoroughly uh photographed

115
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,600
so there's a lot of opportunities for

116
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,199
algorithms to interplay between the two

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,720
domains

118
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,400
so what we're looking for and what we

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
want to partner with are organizations

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,160
that need to get to space need to get to

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,840
space

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,520
timely and let us help you with your

123
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,680
radiation testing again I'm Blair dwit

124
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,520
and come see us at our table across the

125
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,520
hall thank you
