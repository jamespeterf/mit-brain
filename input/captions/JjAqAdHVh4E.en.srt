00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
This was going on for 32 years. It

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,880
started uh just as a uh sort of like one

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,400
of the MIT hacks. They would just

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,680
basically take the piano off the roof

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,519
themselves and then just throw it off

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,960
onto the Amherst Alley side. The good

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,440
thing about the pianos is they're all

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,799
broken. They're useless and we're using

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
them to get out a little frustration

10
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,640
after drop date. Drop date is the last

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,720
day at MIT where you can officially drop

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,320
a class without it being counted against

13
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,599
you on your grades or on your record. 4

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,599

15
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,599

[Music]

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,840
And it hit the target. How can my team

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,840
misal?
