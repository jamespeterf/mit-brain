1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,640
So uh that gives me the opportunity to

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,599
introduce uh Carrie COY uh who's the

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,120
Sheila Ed Evans Whitnol Professor uh

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,360
within the MIT department of aereroastro

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,600
um she leads the space

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
telecommunications astronomy and

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,960
radiation star lab where

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,600
>> I'm sorry let her walk away with

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
>> no I won't go too far. um where her team

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,359
develops small satellite technologies

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,599
for laser free space optical

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,680
communications, weather sensing, earth

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
observation and astrophysics space

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
telescopes.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,000
And her talk today is titled compute

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,120
above the clouds laser comms and 5G NTN

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,120
for AIdriven constellations.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,435
So join me in welcoming Professor Carrie

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,455
Cahooy.

20
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:52,455
[applause]

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,520
Let's see.

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,600
Still driving here. All right. Well,

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,080
it's great to be here and I've enjoyed

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,519
all of the presentations so far. I feel

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,159
like I'm learning a lot. So, thanks for

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,080
having me. Um, I'm here to talk about uh

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,560
compute above the clouds and this is

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,040
kind of a

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,040
I don't know watching a creation of

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
something moment for me because I'm I'm

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
seeing we've been talking a lot about

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,640
how the internet evolved. Um, and then

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,600
we're talking about the fiber backbone

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,759
that we have now. And we're seeing that

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,840
happen in space. And so I'm excited to

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,759
tell you what I'm seeing and a little

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
bit about how I see it coming together

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
and some directions that I think we can

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,799
go with it. Um, so this talk is comput

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,840
above the clouds. Kind of envisioning

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,320
what's happening um, above literal

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,479
clouds. There's computing clouds and I

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,439
think we're seeing that literally above

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,560
the clouds in space and orbit. Um, so

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,240
we're going to talk a little bit about

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,680
how that's happening. Um, some of the

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
enablers that I'm going to talk about

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,720
today are laser communications, which

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,240
are one of the things that my group

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,280
works on. I'm in the aereroastro

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
department. I run the space

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,520
telecommunications, astronomy and

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
radiation or star lab here. Um, and we

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,119
also do radio, we do RF, we do weather

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,759
sensing, we do earth observation

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,680
imaging. And, um, we've gotten into, um,

57
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,200
using AI for remote sensing, too. So,

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,400
lots of fun things coming together, and

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
I think there's a lot of excitement

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,520
happening.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,959
All right. So, this is um just my you

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
don't have to read through this, but

63
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,520
this is kind of keeping track of where

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,200
we are. So, if you're really bored, you

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
can just watch the little lines go bold

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,400
and then we'll get to the end at some

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
point. Um [laughter]

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
but the motivation is I was saying here

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,160
um historically when we're doing Earth

70
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
observations for for agriculture, for

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,160
energy mining, for industry, for

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,720
communications, we have this modality

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
where we have the sensor that's on orbit

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,360
and it's looking down at Earth. We take

75
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,959
the picture, we store it on board. When

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
we fly over the ground station, we down

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,400
link it and then it makes its way

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,800
through analysis anal an analysts into

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
the cloud or what we're calling the

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,360
cloud now. You know, our our network of

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,760
computers um where we use this data um

82
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,280
AWS, whatever it is. Um what we're

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,920
seeing happen is more exciting than

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,080
that. So we're seeing the compute move.

85
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,080
Um we're seeing compute being used on

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,560
orbit. So, those sensors that are taking

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,080
images, we're using compute on board now

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,480
to decide whether or not we got the

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,720
picture of what we wanted. Was it

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,959
cloudy? Did we get the red barn? Were we

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
following the train? Were we following a

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,360
plane? What were we looking at? Did we

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,000
see the flood? Um, if it's the image we

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
wanted, we can save it. If it's not, we

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
can put those images in a different

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
queue and we can accelerate the down

97
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,560
link and distribution of the thing that

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
we really cared about. Um, even better,

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,480
once we figured out that we saw it, we

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,920
can start talking because we now have

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,280
laser come cross links, which I'll talk

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,560
about in a second, to all of the other

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,760
satellites in orbit and tell them, "Hey,

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,239
I got it. It's over here." Um, and we

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,400
can retask and replan. So, all of these

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,000
things didn't used to be possible at all

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
and they're just coming into fruition

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
now. And it's very exciting. It's kind

109
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,080
of like a birth. Um, so what we're

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,319
seeing is this dynamic tasking,

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,959
allocating the sensor time. The sensor

112
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,519
is looking at its own data, deriving the

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,680
insights, shuttling it to where it needs

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
to go, letting everybody else know about

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,919
it, allowing them to dynamically task

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
and replan again, and down linking it to

117
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,000
where it needs to go. If it does need to

118
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
go down, may not need to go down, maybe

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
just enough information to replan the ne

120
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,080
next task and follow the next thing. So,

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
this is all very exciting. So, I'm

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
calling that the cloud above the clouds

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,360
because I think that's what we're seeing

124
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,479
now. Um,

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,720
so, um, why now and why is it happening?

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,720
How'd we get here finally to this point

127
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
where I think we're really at this this

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,639
edge of really exciting things happening

129
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
with our ability to sense and um, use

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,639
Earth observation data and

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,639
communications. We have these um, low

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,520
Earth orbit or LEO mega commmunication

133
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,160
constellations that now exist. Um, we

134
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,400
have also enormous data volumes from

135
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
synthetic aperture radar which can see

136
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,880
through clouds anyway. So, they don't

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,400
care quite as much, [laughter] but they

138
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,600
have enormous amounts of data and they

139
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,000
are still looking for things whether

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
it's deformationations or moving objects

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,240
and they'll want to identify them

142
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,759
quickly. Um, we have a lot of Earth

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,039
observation imagery. We're starting to

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,720
look at different colors and different

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
bands and be able to tell materials

146
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,240
properties on orbit. Um, which is also

147
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,759
very exciting. Um, we have advances in

148
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
onorbit compute because these

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,360
constellations are in low Earth orbit.

150
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,088
The um, how do my colleagues call them?

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,759
Pew pew pew space particles um

152
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:36,400
[laughter] that like to take out the

153
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,880
electronics um, the radiation, the

154
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,479
ionizing radiation is less of a concern.

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
It still happens and you still have to

156
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,400
recover from it, but you're able to use

157
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,080
commercial um compute and commercial

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,479
processors on orbit much more

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,320
successfully than you can um at higher

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,560
altitudes or at further distances from

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,199
the Earth where there's a lot more um

162
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
pew pew pew. I see radiation. It doesn't

163
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
work quite as well if I'm not at a high

164
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,520
voice. I have to get my pitch higher. Um

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
okay, so so we have this AI on board and

166
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,199
having the eye on board and having the

167
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
inferences really

168
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,880
kind of makes your brain twist around

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
this whole

170
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,479
communications bottleneck and capacity

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,759
limits problem because

172
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,759
maybe it doesn't exist anymore.

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,960
You know, maybe we don't need to down

174
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
link gigabits of data per second. Maybe

175
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,319
flying things around at high speed isn't

176
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,080
the problem. Um bits may just need to be

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
more strategically routed and we may not

178
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,960
need quite as many of them piped

179
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,479
everywhere. We may still want a lot of

180
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,520
data but um it may may make us rethink

181
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,120
this whole um you know communication

182
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,919
capacity problem that we've been dealing

183
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
with. Um so we might have be in a

184
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,039
situation we're deciding and delivering

185
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,039
from on orbit um how we manage our data

186
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,280
and what we talk to and what we're

187
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,840
coordinating because we can do it across

188
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,080
great distances which we have a really

189
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,080
hard time doing from the ground.

190
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Um so so these in laser inter satellite

191
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,960
links that are connecting nodes on orbit

192
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,919
are really enabling um and they're

193
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,479
augmenting radio down links and up links

194
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,319
for commanding and this is leading us to

195
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,240
a era where I think we really are

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
getting more programmable capability in

197
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,440
space where space is something that we

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,759
can coordinate we can program we can

199
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,319
task we can control much better than

200
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
we've ever been able to do before. Um,

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,599
so this means that we can have more

202
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,400
targeted satellite services, not just

203
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,599
sensor data dumps and um, be a lot

204
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
smarter about this. So some of the

205
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,000
images on the slide are SpaceX Starlink.

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,240
So that is a stack of satellites um, in

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,440
a in a in a payload fairing about to be

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,919
deployed on orbit. Um, the next image

209
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
down is the reusable launch vehicles.

210
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,000
Um, I think a lot of people have seen

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,240
the Falcon 9's land. And then um, we're

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,639
looking at this happening globally. So

213
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,960
in China even we have similar

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,879
constellations that are flatpacked um

215
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,879
with similar communications capability

216
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,840
and crossling capability happening and

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,520
so we are having a scenario where we're

218
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,960
going to have multiple large players

219
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,400
competing for space. So I think there's

220
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,520
a lot of interesting things that some of

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,080
my colleagues are working on in

222
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,960
Aereroastra as well with respect to um

223
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,039
space use and space congestion. Um but

224
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,160
that that all only helps motivate some

225
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:22,240
of the um secure laser um communications

226
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,479
links arguments. um even more so

227
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
exciting. Um so the things that we have

228
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,759
to come overcome, the problems that

229
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
we're solving with these space systems

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,840
that we we for the most part have

231
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
solved. So not a lot of these are really

232
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,560
drivers anymore as just things that

233
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,080
we're aware of. Power is limited. Um so

234
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,399
we're we're operating off of batteries.

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,159
We're operating in solar. There are some

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
power beaming technologies that are

237
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,160
exciting, but they're still expensive

238
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,560
and hard to do. So, [laughter]

239
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,839
so if you want to get um power in

240
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
eclipse when you're on the dark side

241
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
when you're not in the sunlight that

242
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
that can you have to plan for that and

243
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,920
have batteries for that [gasps] when

244
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,760
you're in space. Um everybody has this

245
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,120
mental image of your computers and your

246
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,800
towers and they have the fans and the

247
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
fans make noise and they cool the chips,

248
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,560
right?

249
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
We don't have fans in space. It's

250
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,640
vacuum. You have to radiate or conduct

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,240
heat away. There's no convection. And so

252
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,560
it's one of the things that we do have

253
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,880
to do is be really cognizant of thermal

254
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,480
loading when we're running processors in

255
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,686
space. So we use power but when we use

256
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
power we get hot and we need we

257
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:24,480
[laughter] need to manage that somehow.

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,160
So thermal materials will also be um and

259
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,440
thermal management are things that are

260
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,040
important. Um in order to have the laser

261
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,519
cross links between nodes we use um

262
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,480
laser links and the pointing for those

263
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,399
is really really super precise. Um, and

264
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,360
I'll talk a little bit more about that.

265
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,200
Um, we're also moving fast. 7 kilometers

266
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
per second flying across the sky. It

267
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,519
takes about 10 minutes to go from

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,279
horizon to horizon. That's fast. Um,

269
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
that causes Doppler shifts in our

270
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,240
signals. And we'll talk a little about

271
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
that because when we're dealing with

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,320
that and we're trying to incorporate and

273
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,200
make this even more accessible, starting

274
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,959
to connect to commercial handheld

275
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,360
devices, cell phones, which I I showed

276
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
in one of the the overview slide. We're

277
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,320
going directly from satellite towers and

278
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,399
we're treating satellites like base

279
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,560
stations now directly to your cell

280
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,399
phone. Um the Doppler shift caused by

281
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
those high velocities is a factor and we

282
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,079
need to plan that into our standards and

283
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,680
and think about that and how to manage

284
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,920
it. We don't really want our cell phones

285
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,079
to have to deal with it. Um [laughter]

286
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,120
we'd much rather have the towers deal

287
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,399
with that. So we'll talk more about that

288
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,560
um and how regulatory um plays a role um

289
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,399
in these untopability standards. And

290
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,240
then um weather is still going to affect

291
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,200
ground down links. So that's one of the

292
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,519
reasons we don't really use optical um

293
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,680
for down links. Clouds still are a

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,120
problem. So this is a scenario where we

295
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,680
do need hybrid networks. We're still

296
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,360
going to need radio. And um making

297
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
decisions about what to use when is

298
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,800
something that the on-orbit compute will

299
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,320
really help enable.

300
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,040
Um autonomy that is reliable and

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,120
cost-effective. So, we talked about this

302
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,079
vision of having them make decisions

303
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,079
based on what they see on orbit and

304
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,120
updating plans, replanning things,

305
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,800
retasking. Um, it needs to be

306
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,440
cost-ffective and reliable. Nobody's

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,160
going to want to spend, you know,

308
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,480
enormous amounts of their budget on the

309
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,760
software and on the processing. It needs

310
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,920
to be reusable. It needs to be

311
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,000
repeatable. It needs to not be custom

312
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,079
every time. So, we need ways of doing

313
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,320
that that um are reliable and cost-

314
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,000
effective. And we also need

315
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,680
interoperability across fleets and

316
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,560
platforms because even though we have

317
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,920
some dominant players in space, the same

318
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,920
people aren't making all of the

319
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,079
hardware. And even if they were the same

320
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
people making all of the hardware, um

321
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,079
things going obsolete is a really good

322
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,399
way of making sure that you can't talk

323
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,920
to yourself in a later generation. So

324
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,360
interoperability is still really

325
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,600
important to plan even if you have

326
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,839
dominant players and and we we do have

327
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
multiple players in the market. Um and

328
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,560
then of course there's security. So

329
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,279
security is still very much an issue. Um

330
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,959
we we worry a lot about who's getting

331
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,600
what information when. And I'm going to

332
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,560
talk a little bit about federated AI on

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,399
orbit to address that. So just as a prep

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,839
um um um of ways that you can manage um

335
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,360
improving everybody's overall

336
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,519
performance without necessarily giving

337
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,360
away all the data. Um all right so I I I

338
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
mentioned briefly so this is an image of

339
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,880
um Apple connecting to a global star

340
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,040
satellite. These are global star is kind

341
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,800
of an established player for decades in

342
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,440
the space communications business if if

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,839
you're not familiar with global star. Um

344
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,680
but um we're going to talk a little bit

345
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,360
about the building blocks next. So the

346
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,360
the things that really led up to this

347
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
this kind of birth of capability that

348
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
we're we're right on the edge of right

349
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
now. Um so I just want to make this

350
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,920
statement [laughter] with flashing

351
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,360
lights. Lasercom what I see happening

352
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,480
here is laser is not replacing radio. It

353
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,279
is the high-capacity spine the backbone

354
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,360
like terrestrial fiber that is going to

355
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,440
make modern satellite networks able to

356
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
behave like cloud backbones do here on

357
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,320
Earth. So it's fast, secure, it's

358
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,160
scalable. RF is going to keep us being

359
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,680
able to do that last hop down to the

360
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,880
ground through the clouds for the most

361
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,560
part if you're learn frequency um and

362
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,480
make it universally available. So this

363
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,240
is really about hybrid. So it's it's not

364
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,639
really replacing RF, it's augmenting it

365
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,639
and it's making it more like what we

366
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,040
have here on Earth for our ground cloud

367
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,959
networks.

368
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,040
All right. So we have um laser

369
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,560
interatellite links which are our

370
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,800
backbone. um the space equivalent of

371
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,680
optical fiber networks on the ground.

372
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,560
Again, precision pointing is key and and

373
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,600
like our fiber networks on the ground.

374
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,760
Um it's really pointto-point, right? It

375
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
it you you can steer your beam to

376
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,160
different things, but you need to know

377
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,839
where you're pointing to. It's not like

378
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
a radio where you can just broadcast or

379
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,760
multiccast right now. There's not really

380
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,839
a great way to do that with optical. So,

381
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,240
it's really the equivalent of optical

382
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:08,234
fiber. And then what's happening now um

383
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,079
talking about 3GPP and all the G's for

384
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:12,880
[laughter] communications for our our

385
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,920
our devices um they have some new

386
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,079
releases um from 5G with what's called

387
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,600
the non-aterrestrial network. They're

388
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,600
making modifications and I'll talk in

389
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,680
more detail about that. They're making

390
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,199
specific modifications that allow our

391
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,639
devices as built your cell phone to

392
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,279
connect directly to satellites and

393
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,399
mobile platforms more easily.

394
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,959
So um on on satellites on aerial mobile

395
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,800
platforms they're just

396
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,480
implementing things that allow reduced

397
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,600
capability that allow the Doppler

398
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,920
management um and connect to multiple

399
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
devices and allow directtodevice

400
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,079
connectability. So these are all things

401
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,519
that are that are happening. Um and then

402
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,040
the the last thing that's really

403
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,279
enabling this like I mentioned is the

404
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,800
onboard AI and edge compute. So we're

405
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,959
flying in lower earth orbit. We've

406
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,120
discovered that, you know, we can get

407
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,600
away with flying commercial components

408
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,160
in orbit successfully. We build in some

409
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,800
redundancy. We build in some, you know,

410
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,800
triple modular redundancy voting and we

411
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,399
we can do this. So, we're flying GPUs,

412
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
we're flying commercial FPGAAS, we're

413
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,040
flying AS6, and we've got more compute

414
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,680
on orbit, more capability now than we'll

415
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,279
we've ever had before. Um, so this is

416
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,399
allowing us and and our students have

417
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,240
done this here. you know they have

418
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,920
cubats nano satellites just for

419
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
demonstration. ISA had one. There are

420
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,959
some um that the US have now where you

421
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,120
can literally you know upload code and

422
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,199
run your own AI models on their

423
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
processors have it grab images, have it

424
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,079
do the identification and demonstrate

425
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
that your algorithms work. So you can do

426
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,399
classification, you can do feature

427
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,880
recognition. This is this is happening.

428
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,399
Um laser angel satellite winks are

429
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,240
great. The top image here is showing

430
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,839
kind of like a large radio beam in the

431
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,040
green with a narrower laser beam.

432
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,759
They're actually even narrower than that

433
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,279
a lot of the times. Um when you have a

434
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,680
spacetospace link, you don't have to

435
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
worry about clouds, just space to space.

436
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,440
What you do have to worry about is tiny

437
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,199
terminal to tiny terminal with tiny beam

438
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,040
and you have to find each other. So they

439
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,079
do all these fun spiral search

440
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,519
algorithms. That's a whole another

441
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,759
optimization fun problem where you're

442
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,839
trying to find each other and hit each

443
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,680
other with, you know, blinky the wide

444
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
thing. Okay, I see you. Okay, narrow

445
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,040
thing coming. Okay, now I'm going to spy

446
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
around and tell you, okay, I got it. Um,

447
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,600
back and forth only. You don't really

448
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,131
have a coms link to tell each other

449
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,240
anything until you get it working.

450
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:30,000
[laughter] It's it's a fun problem. Um,

451
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,680
but um, all of the devices and all the

452
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,240
capability to do that are established.

453
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,800
Um, SpaceX Starlink is making something

454
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,800
like 300,000

455
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,680
um, contacts between spacecraft per day

456
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,680
of their interatellite links. It's it's

457
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
we're doing this at at scale. So, this

458
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,759
is this is happening. it's no longer

459
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,079
like a science project. Um, this allows

460
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,839
spatial reuse. So, because they're so

461
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,360
narrow, we don't really have to worry

462
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,199
about, like we do with radio,

463
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,519
interfering with somebody else's

464
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,199
spectrum. Um, and it it really is very

465
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,679
secure. If you don't know where the

466
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,400
signal is pointing, you're not going to

467
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
get it. Um, it it's very difficult for

468
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,439
you. Unless you have like a giant

469
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,039
detector that's very sensitive, you're

470
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,679
you're you're just not going to find it.

471
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,199
Um, so security is improved. Um and um

472
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,480
one of the things my lab works on, this

473
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,480
is just an example of one of our

474
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,919
projects where we're using micro

475
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,199
electromechanical systems and fine

476
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,679
steering mirrors to do the precision

477
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,320
pointing. So this is technology that you

478
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,840
know we've pioneered. We're using it's

479
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
kind of state-of-the-art right now and

480
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,000
it's enabling this connectivity, this

481
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,080
backbone to exist between spacecraft. Um

482
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,160
the laser terminal here is an example of

483
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,280
a of a small laser terminal that SpaceX

484
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,440
is now um making available for trial. I

485
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120
assume they'll begin selling it soon to

486
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,080
third party spacecraft to connect with

487
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,600
their network on orbit instead of just

488
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,679
ground terminals. So, they're going to

489
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,039
have space terminals as well. So, these

490
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,280
are these are exciting things that are

491
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,440
happening.

492
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
Um, so 5G naterrestrial networks, I'm

493
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
going to kind of talk through the the

494
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,880
diagrams here. Um, they're a little

495
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
they're a little busy. So, when we're

496
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,240
talking about 5G nontrestrial networks,

497
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,039
they're talking about including things

498
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,200
like satellites and aerospace platforms

499
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,520
as well as other mobile platforms as

500
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,160
part of the network that can talk to

501
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,799
your handheld devices, to your internet

502
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,200
of things devices. Um, so these are

503
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,200
these are things that they're they want

504
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,240
to enable and they're modifying their

505
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
standards to make it possible. So, in in

506
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,640
the standard you're going to see these

507
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,160
red boxes here are the new things that

508
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,240
they're changing. So I'm gonna I'm going

509
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,919
to go through a couple of them, but um

510
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,760
satellite and high altitude platforms.

511
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
That's what HAPS is here. So satcom

512
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,240
infrastructure.

513
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,559
Um and then ground stations. So

514
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,640
incorporating the ground stations that

515
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,360
talk to the mobile platforms, the high

516
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,360
altitude platforms, making those part of

517
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,039
the system. Um and it it's just adding

518
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,720
the control for these non-aterrestrial

519
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,400
networks to deal with the latency.

520
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
Sometimes things don't connect quite as

521
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,080
quickly. Sometimes they're very resource

522
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,520
constrained. Like I said, you're moving

523
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,600
very fast. You have to handle the

524
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,039
frequency shifts due to Doppler, but you

525
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,480
don't want your cell phone to have to

526
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,240
deal with that. So, you want that

527
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,160
handled on the other end. Um, you also

528
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,200
when you're transmitting things, you you

529
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,039
have this um automatic repeat request

530
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,840
where like it didn't get the packet, so

531
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,679
it asks for you to send it again. Doing

532
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,160
that over and over again is a really

533
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,160
good way to use up a lot of power and

534
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,240
resources. And some of these mobile

535
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,320
systems don't want to do that. So, you

536
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
want to have the ability to operate and

537
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,480
be like, "Didn't get the packet. Oh,

538
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
well, too bad. Um, move on. Maybe I'll

539
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,240
get it from the next station or maybe

540
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
they'll the user will resend it." So,

541
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,840
um, there there are ways that they're

542
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,799
they're implementing that to conserve

543
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,320
resources. Um, and then normally when

544
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
you're transmitting, you kind of have to

545
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,240
let people know. So, you kind of have to

546
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,720
like wave and be like, "Can I send now?"

547
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,160
Um, and that takes resources, too. So

548
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,080
they're now allowing um grant free um

549
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,840
packets to be sent without all of the

550
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,120
same with less they're still scheduling

551
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,039
overhead but it's a lot less than it

552
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,720
used to be. So these are the ways that

553
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,200
they're modifying existing protocols to

554
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,080
make it possible for your existing

555
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,799
device at the existing cost to have this

556
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,520
expanded capability and be part of this

557
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,840
great new network that is forming in

558
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,200
front of us. So these these are exciting

559
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,000
things.

560
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,799
Um this is just a couple of the the um

561
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
releases that are kind of in process. So

562
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,480
this is um releases 17 and 18. This is

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
mimicking what we do with communication

564
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
satellites. So communication satellites

565
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,400
historically have been what are called

566
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,240
bent pipes. Literally bent pipes. When I

567
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,120
was um learning this as an electrical

568
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
engineer, I was like, what are you

569
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,080
talking about pipes? I'm not a plumber

570
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,099
when pi pipes. And then I realized that

571
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,480
wave guides look just like pipes um

572
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:52,000
[laughter] for the high power systems.

573
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,760
But what it means is that you send a

574
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,520
signal up and it pretty much just goes

575
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,919
up and through and comes right back

576
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,600
down. You don't do anything to it,

577
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,880
right? It goes up and then back down

578
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,640
somewhere else. So the whole point of

579
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
this, you know, satellite communications

580
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,840
is to send the signal up from somewhere

581
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,159
else and have other people get the exact

582
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,360
same signal, right? So that's kind of

583
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,039
what is going on with the

584
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,640
non-aterrestrial networks with releases

585
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,280
17 and 18. They're doing that with your

586
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,559
devices now where they're allowing your

587
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
signals to be sent up to satellites and

588
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,240
come down to your devices as a in bent

589
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:25,120
pipe form. The release 19 is allowing

590
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,000
what's called um regenerative um

591
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,280
capability on board. So now you can send

592
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,960
signals up and instead of just piping it

593
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,720
through, it can save them, manipulate

594
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,720
them, redirect them, amplify them,

595
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,400
change the frequency, change the

596
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,799
modulation, and send them somewhere

597
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,080
else. So it's a lot more capable. And

598
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,600
that's kind of where where they are now

599
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,520
on 19. And they're going to keep going

600
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,720
from there. So, um, that's that's kind

601
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
of what you're seeing here. So, this is

602
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,760
the bent pipe for 17 and 18 through GGPB

603
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,480
releases 17 and 18. And this is release

604
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,320
19 where you're seeing the inter

605
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,280
satellite links and the regenerative

606
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,520
capability that's being enabled.

607
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,360
So, this is this is where we are now.

608
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
Um, it's it's a sign that we're we're

609
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,640
hitting the accelerator to do even more

610
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,080
things with this. Um, which is exciting.

611
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
So, I wanted to talk about it, but it is

612
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,840
one of the enabling things for this

613
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,799
cloud capability that I'm seeing

614
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,880
happening in space. So, we're seeing

615
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,880
non-aterrestrial networks, the laser com

616
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,559
links, the AI on board. We're going

617
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,320
somewhere with us. It's exciting.

618
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,600
All right, [laughter] this is an eye

619
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,760
chart. We're only going to look at the

620
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,440
bottom row, just like in the optometrist

621
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,679
office. If you can see the bottom row,

622
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,520
cover one arm. Um, [laughter]

623
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,760
but the point of this slide was we had

624
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,080
students go through this and we wanted

625
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,840
to think about, okay, we're Earth

626
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,600
observation aerospace engineers. what

627
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,360
are the things that we can do with AI on

628
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,840
board satellites.

629
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,520
So first of course we're MIT students

630
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,039
and we we we have to go through all the

631
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,039
things. So we start with AI machine

632
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,240
learning as a subset of AI you know

633
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,159
supervised learning unsupervised

634
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,600
learning reinforcement learning the

635
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,720
evolutionary algorithms constraint

636
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,559
satisfaction these are all kind of the

637
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
high level things. So we go through the

638
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,720
type of AI, the methods, the different

639
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,919
tasks, the algorithms that you can use

640
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,360
for each of them, um, and then the the

641
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,919
if there are deep learning algorithms,

642
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,280
which there are, um, which ones go with

643
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,039
each category. And then we thought

644
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,640
about, okay, for each of these things,

645
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,840
what are the example applications that

646
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,640
we could use this for in a space cloud

647
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,480
network? So the example applications

648
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,520
operation planning, navigation,

649
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,200
scientific um predictions, cloud

650
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,799
filtering, feature extractions, which I

651
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,320
kind of emphasized before. You can look

652
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,440
for floods, you can look for wildfires,

653
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,039
you can follow that train. Um

654
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
and that that is quite a few of them.

655
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,799
Spacecraft health management. One of the

656
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,280
most exciting things that I can think of

657
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,880
to do with AI on orbit is to have the

658
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,280
satellite look at its own telemetry and

659
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,960
figure out what's wrong with itself. um

660
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,320
and try to take actions to mitigate it

661
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,200
without incorporating the ground in the

662
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,880
loop if it if it doesn't need to or only

663
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,960
flagging us when there are high concerns

664
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,919
especially with radiation damage and

665
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,200
things like that. Um, and I'll talk more

666
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,720
about this, but the other exciting thing

667
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,440
that I can really think to do with AI on

668
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,640
orbit, how many people here do not like

669
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,640
writing interface driver software?

670
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,799
Wouldn't it be great if it just

671
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,200
monitored the bits coming in and could

672
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,520
see from the pattern what the protocol

673
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,440
was and write its own software for

674
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,679
whatever that was at the time? That

675
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,880
would be fantastic. So like things like

676
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,720
that we can imagine happening and

677
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
enabling all this interoperability that

678
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,640
we'd like to see as part of the space

679
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,880
cloud. Right? So these are spacecraft

680
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,279
health management getting rid of having

681
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,240
to write so much software [laughter]

682
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,120
just having [clears throat] it be aware

683
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,600
of what what's coming in um long-term

684
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,320
navigation and tracking

685
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,600
and um configuring and optimizing its

686
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,400
own orbit and its own um you know

687
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,799
management of its onboard resources. So

688
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,799
all of these things you can do um and

689
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,559
and are are very exciting. There's a lot

690
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,039
going on here. This is just another

691
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,960
example. Um on the left here we're

692
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,400
talking about like an instrument level

693
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,919
application where you have an instrument

694
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,679
that activates it collects data. It

695
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,240
stores the data and then it you know

696
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,159
decides what to do with it. It was the

697
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,679
data good enough? No. It'll collect more

698
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
data. Better data. Wait for the better

699
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,039
data. Send down only when it's good

700
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,720
enough. Um so you send down less data.

701
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,360
you'd only send the good data. You'd

702
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,880
prioritize the data down links. Um, so

703
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,559
you you'd use things like image

704
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,159
recognition, object detection, change

705
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,679
detection, um, prioritization. And the

706
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,360
way that this works on orbit is your

707
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,360
input is literally your images and you

708
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,520
can have lots of input. This this

709
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,000
multimodal AI where you can put in all

710
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,000
the colors. You can put in thermal data

711
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,799
plus optical data plus, you know, your

712
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,320
radar data all at the same time and have

713
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,760
it really infer something about the

714
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,640
scene. if you're training the models to

715
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,480
handle this. Um, training the models is

716
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,227
another story, but I only have time for

717
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,159
one talk.

718
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:04,080
[laughter] So, so you put these these

719
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,480
this data into the learning networks and

720
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,919
you have your classified features as an

721
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,240
output and then you can make decisions

722
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,240
based on on what you've got. Um, so this

723
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,000
is this is all all very exciting and we

724
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
have some the URL links are to some of

725
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,840
the work that we've done in this area.

726
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Lots of other people are working on this

727
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,960
onboard autonomy resource scheduling.

728
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,799
So, I like my little Lego satellite

729
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,559
here. What it's doing is the green beam

730
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,080
is it's kind of looking out and forward

731
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,480
first looking along its horizon

732
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,640
and it's seeing okay what's in front of

733
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,880
me and it's deciding based on what it

734
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,640
sees in this case cloudy or not where it

735
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
wants to use the red beam to take the

736
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,000
picture and the beams in this case are

737
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,200
field of views of cameras. So it's just

738
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,640
looking ahead making decision and then

739
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,960
taking the picture at exactly the right

740
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,520
time when it passes over the clear spot.

741
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Um, so this is this is an example of of

742
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,679
something that we've written algorithms

743
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,120
to do. This is kind of a another eye

744
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,520
chart. Sorry, [laughter]

745
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,720
not quite as easy as the other one. Um,

746
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,240
where we have um this is kind of a the

747
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,840
from the field of view of a from the

748
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,159
mind of a satellite, right? This is what

749
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,440
it sees. It sees the horizon of the

750
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,919
Earth in front of it. Um, all of the

751
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,520
black dots are things that it it knows

752
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,120
are targets. It's been told are targets,

753
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,320
but it can't it it hasn't looked at them

754
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,679
yet.

755
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,039
um when when we see have a cloud map and

756
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,799
we have that image of the clouds and we

757
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,320
can plan for clear and cloudy. The reds

758
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,559
are things that we won't be able to see

759
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,240
on this pass. The greens are things that

760
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,320
we will be able to see on this pass from

761
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,240
our target list. And um the green dot

762
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,960
here is where my satellite would look if

763
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,200
we're looking straight down. And the the

764
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,279
kind of bumpy line here is like how I'm

765
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,120
using my onboard reaction wheels or my

766
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,400
thrusters to tip and tilt my satellite

767
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,480
to make sure I take pictures of the

768
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,600
right thing. That could be a gimbal on

769
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,880
your camera if you don't want to tilt

770
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,880
your whole satellite. There are lots of

771
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,960
different ways to do this. So, um I'm

772
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,120
just gonna play that for a second. So,

773
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,240
you can write an optimizer

774
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,840
to get this look ahead data and to plan

775
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,679
to hit as many green dots. It's just

776
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,440
like, you know, playing a video game.

777
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,360
[laughter]

778
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,039
So, so if the internet is for gamers,

779
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,679
then the space the space cloud's also

780
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,120
for gamers. Um we we like this. So, and

781
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,320
it's it's just chasing the green dots

782
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,080
and it's doing the most highv value

783
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,240
green dots it can um the best it can

784
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,960
with this one look ahead camera, right?

785
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,679
You can imagine not just its own look

786
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,360
ahead camera, but maybe it talks to the

787
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,600
guys in front of it or the guys behind

788
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,760
it and it coordinates with them because

789
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,840
you've got this um space internet thing

790
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,960
going now. So, lots of exciting things

791
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,480
can happen with on orbit autonomy.

792
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,320
This is kind of what I was talking about

793
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,014
about the fault handling. We've tried

794
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,799
this too. It does work. you can um

795
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:44,640
[laughter]

796
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,320
so what we did with this is supervised

797
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,720
and I know we want to get it to more

798
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,039
unsupervised but for the moment we

799
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,520
basically took a bunch of really grumpy

800
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,960
um myself included engineers and grad

801
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,399
students who are former spacecraft

802
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,480
operators and we thought about all the

803
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,080
different ways that we've seen telemetry

804
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,720
mean that things are not working on

805
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,240
board. So so we're we're doing something

806
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,080
good. We're making lemonade with all the

807
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,720
times that things didn't work for us,

808
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,799
right? And so we made a simulator tool

809
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,919
and we used that simulator tool of all

810
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,360
the bad things that could happen in

811
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,200
telemetry and what they mean and we used

812
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,640
it to train a model and then we took

813
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,880
actual satellite telemetry and we're

814
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,600
like hey tell us what's happening based

815
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,799
on all the the bad stuff that happened

816
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,480
to us all the years that we created the

817
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,840
model to train you about and it did. So

818
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,559
it was able to um leverage in this case

819
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,200
we used an autoenccoder GMM long long

820
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,480
short-term memory PCMCI and a common

821
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,080
filter and XG boost tree to just help us

822
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,919
decide what was going on on board that

823
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,760
satellite based on the telemetry in our

824
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,080
own like grumpy model is what I'll call

825
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,320
it our grumpies satellite telemetry

826
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,799
model and and it works great. So you can

827
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,159
you can do this and um that's why I'm

828
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,200
excited about it happening in the future

829
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,600
because I I see this as possible.

830
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,200
um federated with learning in low Earth

831
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,200
orbit. So this I think is a really

832
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,080
exciting idea.

833
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,679
So federated means that you know we may

834
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,159
have constellations and they're not all

835
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,320
owned by the same entity. Maybe they're

836
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,399
kind of friendly kind of like you know

837
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,960
states or the EU. I'm not sure. You know

838
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,600
I I don't I don't know. Maybe talk to

839
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,200
football fans. Um but the different

840
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,880
parts have come together for this common

841
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,399
purpose. They have a shared purpose, but

842
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,760
they don't really want to share all

843
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,200
their data, right? But they have a

844
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,480
shared goal or shared purpose that

845
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,919
they're in they're operating with each

846
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,200
other for. They have this agreement that

847
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,399
they're they have some shared purpose

848
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,159
that they're all operating towards.

849
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,440
Maybe it's wildfire detection. They're

850
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,840
all going to look at all their images

851
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,760
and they're going to look for wildfires.

852
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,480
Um

853
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,880
what they can do is instead of trying to

854
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,360
you know send all their data down for

855
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,760
analyst for analysts to use or to train

856
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,840
a model on the ground, what they could

857
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,720
do is share a model across multiple

858
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,240
satellites where instead of you know

859
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,919
sending their data down or sending their

860
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,000
data amongst each other or all running

861
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,799
the same model, they each send models to

862
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
the data. So you would share your model

863
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,080
and your parameters between your nodes

864
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,399
and they would train it on board with

865
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,480
the data that they have and then they

866
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,600
could share their weights and um

867
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,520
everything that they got their learned

868
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,000
weights and their learn gradients with

869
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,679
other nodes. In that case you're just

870
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,840
improving the overall performance of

871
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,480
your federated system by sharing your

872
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,640
model tuning without actually

873
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,360
necessarily even sharing your data.

874
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,440
Right? So you're enabling a common goal

875
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,000
without having to give away all the

876
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,000
data. So something like this would be

877
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,240
really exciting too where where you have

878
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,760
these federated systems that could work

879
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,159
together and this is a way they could

880
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,120
work together um that wasn't possible

881
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,159
before um while retaining privacy. So

882
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,320
there there are a lot of fun things that

883
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,320
you could do you could do with this. So

884
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,000
um I'm gonna wrap up because there's

885
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,440
there's there's a lot to do here that's

886
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,760
exciting and I I want to have time for

887
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,919
discussion and questions. Um so where we

888
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,399
are now we've got optical cross links

889
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,440
we've got NTN happening we have AI and

890
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,080
autonomy starting to be on board what we

891
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,240
want to do is develop multi-satellite

892
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,360
and groundstation routing um advanced

893
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,880
autonomy so that based on the decisions

894
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,440
that are made from AI models on board

895
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
looking at the data you can do dynamic

896
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,600
tasking you can do routing you do

897
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,120
optimization you can get more value to

898
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,799
your users um more quickly and you can

899
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,720
have a better use of your resources and

900
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,039
have a more robust system overall. So

901
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,279
this is this is fun. Um I would love to

902
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,600
see people add federated learning. So

903
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,440
sharing of models um the weights and

904
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,200
gradients or the tunable parameters of

905
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,640
your models across different types of

906
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,519
networks and constellations. Maybe

907
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,120
they're not all you know collaborators

908
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,320
are part of the same group but they're

909
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,000
willing to coordinate with each other

910
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,679
and they have this as a method for doing

911
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,279
so. Um then there's the actual hardware

912
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,760
part where you really need to test for

913
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,960
interoperability. Um having all these

914
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,440
great ideas is one thing but showing

915
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,279
that it works is another. Um so you need

916
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
to do the testing for radio

917
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,039
interoperability um using uh mobile

918
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,159
network operators that are cooperative.

919
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,720
There are a lot that are very interested

920
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,480
in this right now. Um I also think it's

921
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,640
really important there is not a lot of

922
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,440
optical interoperability right now. the

923
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,000
optical terminals that exist um are not

924
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,000
really being built to compatible

925
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,279
standards and that's that's a problem.

926
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,919
So we want we want to see optical

927
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:36,320
interoperability um and standardization

928
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,320
other than just the SDA's um optical um

929
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,480
standards. So we we'd like we'd like

930
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,559
have a little bit more of an industry um

931
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,399
adoption of of that. Um and then I I'd

932
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,039
like to see this self-healing anomaly

933
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,840
resolution. So AI and ML on board doing

934
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,960
the telemetry monitoring trying to

935
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,039
create new ways to identify what has

936
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,720
been damaged or what function is lost

937
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,799
and either manage it gracefully or

938
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,440
correct it um and then um have more

939
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,360
self-aware connectivity to kind of res

940
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,800
reduce this interoperability problem and

941
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,040
the software turn on all the device

942
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,399
driver interfaces that we keep having to

943
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,079
reprogram over and over again. So, um,

944
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,200
that's kind of where I'd like like to

945
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,760
see this all go. Um, we're happy to work

946
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,119
with people on this. Um, we really enjoy

947
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,879
what we do here. If you can't tell

948
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,440
already from earlier today, there's been

949
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,000
so many great talks. So, ILP is

950
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,240
obviously a very good way for engaging

951
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,159
with us because they do a great job of

952
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,200
um, making sure they um, you know, I

953
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,280
don't know, smack around the professors

954
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,240
until we pay attention, show up, do the

955
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,000
things. Um, [laughter]

956
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,919
no, no, they're they're very very polite

957
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,159
and professional. Um, but getting our

958
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,359
attention can be hard and I I I I I

959
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,079
don't want to I don't want to discount

960
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,480
that. Um, sponsoring graduate research

961
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,720
on campus is a really good way of um

962
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,320
engaging with MIT. Um, you can sponsor

963
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,640
graduates or undergraduates. There's an

964
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,480
undergraduate research pro program that

965
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,440
you can bring in undergrads to work with

966
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,440
um to work with you. Um there's also a

967
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,560
even younger than undergraduate, high

968
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,079
school, and middle school outreach

969
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,560
program that MIT is a part of called the

970
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,920
Beaverwork Summer Institute. Um we're

971
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,880
happy to collaborate on calls for

972
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,240
proposals. Um you can hire MIT students

973
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,320
as interns. Um there's even a January in

974
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,800
between semester period that um students

975
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,800
will will happily go somewhere else for

976
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,920
um and you can even sometimes get them

977
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
over the semesters if they're grad

978
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,119
students who are done with their

979
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,240
classes. If grad students um have gotten

980
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,040
through their degree progress to the

981
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,839
point where they're done with their

982
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,599
classes, there's something called

983
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,599
non-resident graduate student status

984
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,839
where we have graduate students go work

985
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,960
at companies on their thesis problems

986
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,200
once they finished classes and that can

987
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,720
be very effective for companies as well.

988
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,760
Um we're happy to have you in to give

989
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,839
seminars. We're happy to have you talk

990
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,839
to undergrad or grad courses. Um we're

991
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,760
happy to go talk to you. Um so you can

992
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,440
invite us places and um um every few

993
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,359
years not nearly often enough we get

994
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,520
sbaticals and um on occasion we will

995
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,119
spend them at um a company or another

996
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,599
institution. So that's another great way

997
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,440
to work with us. Um but starting with

998
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,640
ILP is a great place. They know all

999
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,000
these things and are happy to help

1000
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,160
connect you to the ones that you like

1001
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,640
best. And um yeah, I'm happy to take

1002
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,900
questions with that. So I I just that's

1003
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,920
want to end with my tagline

1004
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,920
[applause]

1005
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,119
and happy to take questions.

1006
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,119
>> Any questions out there?

1007
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,960
>> Thanks.

1008
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,040
>> Hi, it's great to hear about the smart

1009
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,440
satellites. No, not to disparrage the

1010
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,079
existing ones, but [laughter]

1011
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,720
is is this sort of backwards compatible

1012
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,720
or is it something where new satellites

1013
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,680
are the ones that are going to be this

1014
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,800
amazing?

1015
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,240
>> Um, I think that the ability to

1016
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,200
reprogram some of the existing

1017
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,800
satellites is kind of limited. Um if

1018
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,040
they are reprogrammable there's no

1019
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,160
reason that they can't run algorithms on

1020
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,400
board but getting the um configuration

1021
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,800
set up so that

1022
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,920
um they can route things to the right

1023
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,480
buffers um after they run their you know

1024
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,599
algorithms on the images um is a bit of

1025
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,320
a big ask for for a lot of what many

1026
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,079
operators build for. So I won't say no

1027
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
but it's it's it's definitely a

1028
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,920
challenge.

1029
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,400
>> Okay. And a follow on uh so this sky

1030
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,599
internet or Skynet

1031
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,000
um we know that the internet is subject

1032
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,440
to hacking. So if you're doing more

1033
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,599
analysis on a satellite hopefully

1034
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,839
someone's thinking about how to keep

1035
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,160
that from getting compromised or

1036
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,800
captured by somebody else.

1037
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,400
>> Yeah. Yeah. No. Um

1038
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,480
there is cyber security issues. Um

1039
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,079
optical communication is a great initial

1040
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,680
start, right? Because it's it's pretty

1041
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,720
difficult to um contact things that you

1042
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,960
don't know where they are, where to

1043
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,119
point to exactly. So so that that's it's

1044
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,200
not the only thing, right? But cyber

1045
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,200
security and in integrating security

1046
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,920
protocols is going to be um some

1047
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,640
overhead that's necessary um and would

1048
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,480
need to be incorporated in this. Um

1049
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,960
training the eye to know friend or foe

1050
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,760
commands would be very interesting. um

1051
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,359
training it to know passwords and um

1052
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,800
certain sequences of information um and

1053
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,960
knowing when to send alerts when it's

1054
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,000
asked to do interesting sequences of

1055
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,200
things would be also something that you

1056
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,720
can do with it. Um so I would I would

1057
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,079
say that there's there's opportunity to

1058
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,079
leverage that for security as well.

1059
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,720
Hi. Uh, the satellite to satellite

1060
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,520
communications is not super not a super

1061
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,160
new idea.

1062
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,800
>> No.

1063
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,560
>> But the ability for

1064
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,240
passing the information and then having

1065
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,079
the satellites themselves make some

1066
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,720
decisions, that is a new idea.

1067
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,599
>> Yes.

1068
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,880
>> Um, how far back does the satellite to

1069
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,440
satellite go? I mean we know that SpaceX

1070
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,760
has been doing it for

1071
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,560
handling calls you know cell phone

1072
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,800
calls.

1073
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,000
>> Yeah.

1074
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,560
>> But does that have a history?

1075
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,400
>> It does. Um it goes back to um I mean

1076
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,280
even before Aridium which was one of the

1077
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,520
first in satellite to satellite um

1078
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,920
constellations that the earlier ones

1079
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,160
there was I think um Tellesat Global

1080
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,119
Star which is still in existence you

1081
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,280
know kudos to them. Um [laughter]

1082
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,680
um so so the radio frequency um

1083
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,200
intersatellite links have been in

1084
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,040
existence for a while their their data

1085
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,000
rates have been limited um the

1086
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,760
interoperability has been limited um and

1087
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,839
it's only just now that we're seeing

1088
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,280
some of these NTN standards come in that

1089
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,079
help break it open um to direct to

1090
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,359
devices and make it both more

1091
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,800
interesting and more potentially

1092
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,079
profitable because you're talking about

1093
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,680
not just contacting you know a limited

1094
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,160
customer base but literally everyone

1095
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,640
could use it. So that I think that's

1096
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,920
kind of the the exciting part now

1097
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,520
>> for for those guys. Anyway,

1098
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,960
>> hi. Thank you, Professor Kai. As you

1099
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,800
know, we're really excited our team uh

1100
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,000
with what your team at Starlab is doing.

1101
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,079
I was wondering, could you say more

1102
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,960
above the clouds? Uh what do you see for

1103
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,359
that opportunity with data data centers

1104
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,880
or ways that the uh above the clouds

1105
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,760
could be used both for Earth and also

1106
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,160
for missions to moon, Mars, Aremis or to

1107
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,079
Venus.

1108
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,119
>> Oh, okay. One at a time. [laughter] So,

1109
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,800
so for Earth, um I I think it's not

1110
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,560
going to just be about finding what you

1111
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,400
wanted to look for. Um but also being

1112
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,200
able to

1113
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,440
generate on the fly what's valuable at

1114
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,200
that time to the people who are in your

1115
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,880
service region, right? Um which is not

1116
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,560
what we normally do. We normally

1117
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,839
broadcast and send up the same thing and

1118
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,680
pipe it down. So, I think I think

1119
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,880
there's going to be an that that that

1120
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,359
part is going to be exciting for for

1121
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:05,200
Earth, I think. um for beyond Earth um

1122
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:08,560
for exploration. Um yeah, I think having

1123
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,000
that type having

1124
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,560
247 reasoning and redundancy built into

1125
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,480
some of our exploration initiatives is

1126
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,000
going to be really enabling, right?

1127
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,880
because right now we need mission

1128
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,400
control running everything all of our

1129
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,319
operations and um and everything is I

1130
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,520
mean these poor groups I I don't say

1131
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,880
poor they're very lucky I would have

1132
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,480
killed to be them but like when you're

1133
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,960
running on Mars time to operate your

1134
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,079
Mars rovers and you're off by an hour

1135
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,000
every day and you watch that kind of

1136
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,839
go through a team's life that that's not

1137
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,359
that's not easy and making it easier to

1138
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,760
explore making it easier for these

1139
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,760
things to um connect and alert us to

1140
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,720
things I I mean, from autonomous

1141
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,079
AI based sunflare monitoring networks,

1142
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,440
right? You could you could set up those.

1143
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,440
You could have asteroid monitoring

1144
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,359
networks that are more self-aware and

1145
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,960
self-reporting than just waiting for

1146
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,640
something to get to an alert level and

1147
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,119
for somebody's telescope to trigger on

1148
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,640
it, right? So, like I I think these are

1149
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,079
these are all exciting things that can

1150
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,079
happen.

1151
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,079
>> Yeah.

1152
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,520
>> Um, thank you very much for the for the

1153
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,200
presentation. It was really amazing to

1154
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,960
hear all of the exciting things you work

1155
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,560
on now particularly to the anomaly

1156
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,240
detection end of things that you

1157
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,319
mentioned. I was wondering in terms of

1158
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,160
data because I can imagine there isn't

1159
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,000
as much data right now available for

1160
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,680
training models. So how do you go about

1161
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,480
it like how was the data gathering? Do

1162
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,400
you use synthetic data and how large are

1163
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,160
the models we're talking about because I

1164
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,920
think also there are constraints in term

1165
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,760
of compute as well. Yeah.

1166
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,680
>> Yeah. So the model that we were running

1167
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,520
was able to run on a Raspberry Pi. It

1168
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,520
was but it was supervised, right? So is

1169
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,880
supervised trained on like a simulation

1170
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,200
model. You're right that um people are

1171
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,119
notoriously unwilling to separate

1172
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,720
themselves from their data when things

1173
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,480
go wrong. Um [laughter] they don't

1174
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,920
really want that to get out. So um one

1175
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,079
of the things that I was first when I

1176
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,359
first started at MIT in 2011 that I was

1177
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,280
really interested in was the effect of

1178
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,599
radiation on satellites, right? But

1179
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,839
getting anomaly data from satellite

1180
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,640
operators, even though I worked at one

1181
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,079
and I knew they had a bunch, um was very

1182
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,560
difficult. People don't like to give it

1183
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:19,040
up. So um so I think creating anonymized

1184
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,920
agreements where you have access to some

1185
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,160
of the data but it's it's anonymized and

1186
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,920
you know abstracted in a way that you

1187
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,480
still can get value out of it without

1188
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,000
identifying you know the process IDs

1189
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,760
from the satellite operators that tells

1190
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,440
you oh it was a Lockheed Martin bus and

1191
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,680
you know they had this problem all the

1192
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,065
time like that that not that they did

1193
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm just making that up. Um um

1194
00:43:38,065 --> 00:43:43,920
[laughter] just an example um

1195
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,599
um but but you see what I'm saying like

1196
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,720
they wouldn't want that to get out right

1197
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,599
so so if there was a effort to try to

1198
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,400
have something like an MIT or a neutral

1199
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,319
party that could guarantee anonymity and

1200
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,400
abstraction to a collection of that

1201
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,640
data. Um although there are companies

1202
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,520
right now that actually charge money to

1203
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,440
get access to anomaly data third party c

1204
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,960
companies as well. So like it's it's you

1205
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,880
either you work with them or you create

1206
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,640
your own. But there are ways to do that.

1207
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,400
The other way is to you know get enough

1208
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,119
expert operators that they can tell you

1209
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:19,040
what the key anomalies are and then like

1210
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,839
we did create a a simulation set. So

1211
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,880
yeah

1212
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,625
>> thank you very much.

1213
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,625
>> Great. Okay. Thanks. [applause]

1214
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,640
>> So I don't want to keep anybody from the

1215
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,720
uh the networking time for very long but

1216
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,480
we uh we covered a lot of ground today.

1217
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,240
uh everything from David Clark talking

1218
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,760
about 300 kilobits per second dialup um

1219
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,560
connecting mainframe computers to uh um

1220
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,960
professor uh go here talking about uh

1221
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,119
lasercom at satellites and putting AI in

1222
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,560
space as well. So thanks for hanging in

1223
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,240
there those of you who have hung with us

1224
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,079
the whole day. Really appreciate it.

1225
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,400
Please enjoy the networking session and

1226
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,400
thanks for coming.
