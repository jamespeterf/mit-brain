1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,000
All right. Hi. We're gonna get started.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,160
Um, thank you everyone for coming out on

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,599
a rainy day. I know it's kind of gloomy

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,240
out today, but we're really excited for

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,519
our two speakers today at MIA. Um, the

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,600
first of which is Hanchen. Um, Henchin

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,160
Wang is a joint posttock at Stanford

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,080
with Yuri Leavik um and at Janentech

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,480
with Avivv. He works on AI for

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,960
scientific discovery and therapeutics

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
broadly and earned his PhD in computer

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,119
science um at the University of

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,480
Cambridge with Joan Lassenby. Um some of

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,399
his recent work which I'm sure he'll

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,320
touch up on a bit today as well um

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,559
includes like discrete diffusion, DNA

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
and protein design. Um and so we're

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,840
really really excited to have him here.

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,079
Both of our speakers did come from

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,200
California. So if you're doing the math,

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,719
it's 6:00 am time and so we're really

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,440
really appreciative of you guys. Thank

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,520
you.

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,920
>> Thanks. Um you can hear me right the

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
micro is on. Um

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,520
yeah I don't I don't need more

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,480
introduction. So uh the structure of

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,320
today's talk will be um as I'm giving

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,119
the first talk I will cover like the

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,640
basics of the agents like um I like 20

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,799
25 minutes um we'll talk about the agent

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,720
will be specialized for spatial biology

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,960
and we will cover some new recent agents

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,000
that are doing massive money on aging

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,640
intervention as well as using computers

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,080
to analyze cells as well as um doing a

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,439
better statistical calibration on the um

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,439
different kinds of agents on different

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,600
kinds of data sets. Um yeah, so if you

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,280
think of the um biomedical discovery,

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,000
it's roughly can be divided into like

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,799
three stages. You have some observations

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,280
can be uh from some previous data, it

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,520
can be from the nature or can be from

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,600
you know some literature and you

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,399
generate some hypothesis. The habos can

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,759
be with different forms like whether

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,560
there's like a direct relationship or

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,960
causal infacts from gene A to a

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
phenotype B those kinds of formats and

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,640
we design some experiments to verify

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,560
that to collect more evidence to collect

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,760
more the data to help you to refine or

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,160
reject or accept your hypothesis. So

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,879
it's roughly you can think of it like a

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,480
three interconnected and circulating

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
stages until you find something you

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,360
wanted or until you

59
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,800
run out of your budget. Um and we see

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
that computation helps at like every

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
single stage of them. And there are some

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
examples like for instance you can use

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,840
some source of autoenccoder alo some

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,879
variational measure variations measure

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,760
to decide like which genes or which um

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,080
um are more informative for your for the

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,680
tissues that you are interested or

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
there's like a different ways that can

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,720
use graph you can use the relationship

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,599
of the gene coexp expression patterns to

71
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,720
uh help you design um help you predict

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,360
and design what would be the next rounds

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,440
of experiment term uh uh uh genetic

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,239
perturbations.

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,680
And speak of the observations um I have

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,480
to uh say good words uh to shout loud

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,280
for the w collections of different kinds

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,319
of efforts um for instance omix data for

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,920
instance other types of data as well um

80
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,239
and hypothesis one of my favorite

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,879
example is like uh the double helic

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:27,519
structure of DNA um it's um um back then

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,840
like 50 oh sorry 70 years ago uh when uh

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,720
these two cambridge aluminina developed

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,720
they proposed a hypothesis double uh the

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,400
the structure of DNA is just based on

87
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,440
some pair wise distance matrix from 2D

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,680
um um and it's quite a quite a um I I

89
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,159
would say quite elegant uh example for

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
positive generations and there are more

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,120
examples recently used different kinds

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,480
of computations some are agents uh that

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,159
help us to verify or generate uh some

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,319
better hypothesis Um and the task can go

95
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,519
long and long for every single stages

96
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,680
and there's u there'll be some

97
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,439
computation methods help us to u make

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,519
the uh process easier faster um and

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,199
better

100
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,680
and uh so what is AI agents um in some

101
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
of versions of my slides I usually give

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
a formal definition of the AI agents but

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,759
today let's start with a example so this

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
is kind of the analysis I've done like

105
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,120
last week so uh when we like back and

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,360
forth on a manuscript that is about to

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,120
be preprinted very soon. So basically we

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,520
done a lot of interventions of the mouse

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,919
models and um so our PI is uh commented

110
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,360
in in in in in the documents saying that

111
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,320
you need to find more evidence in the

112
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,280
human data in so in supporting what you

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,840
have been found such as a special um

114
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,880
type of u inflam

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,040
um fibroblast or inflamary microfasages

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,400
that are we know that are critical for

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,080
the uh uh cancer therapeutic um

118
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,240
reactions. So you need to find some

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,720
evidence like shared does does the same

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,960
population happens a lot in the human

121
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,360
single cell RNA seek data as well or

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,479
it's uh have the similar dynamics or

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,919
similar pathways. So um it's kind of

124
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,520
like a very high level instructions and

125
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,360
that's me I converted to a few sentence

126
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,520
and a plugin to cloud code. So I I I

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,479
gave a relative detailed but still very

128
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,639
high level instructions. ask the cloud

129
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,280
code to which is a coding agent you can

130
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,680
think of uh to create a Jupyter notebook

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,320
to project the human prostate cancer

132
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
fiber blast onto the the mouse cancer

133
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,120
associate fiber blast and transfer the

134
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,880
subtype labels from the mouse to human

135
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,600
also load the uh also uh list the data

136
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,160
path for the two data sets use the top

137
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,199
2k high genes intersections so which

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,840
involve like a conversion uh and find

139
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,320
the intersections of the symbols from

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,080
the mouse and to the human and then make

141
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,919
some analysis and visualization as well

142
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,000
as see the results. So the car code it's

143
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,560
uh start working the engine is on and

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,600
it's generate lots of code first

145
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,800
generate plan and its final solution

146
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,440
which uh only involve like two or three

147
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,680
additional inputs from my end and it

148
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,479
could generate a lots of working

149
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,440
solution which include mapping the mouse

150
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,600
and human uh shared gene space and

151
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,919
project the human data to the mouse

152
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,919
transfer the label use a uh a convention

153
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:43,600
method uh um that is shared used by lots

154
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,360
of public literatures and uh doing some

155
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
visualizations

156
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,600
uh uh the U maps the competence score

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,680
the proportion comparations across

158
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,360
different conditions as well as plot the

159
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,440
markers for different subtype annotation

160
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
as well as save the results. So this is

161
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,599
all figures that are generated by cloud

162
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,280
code. The top left is a mouse reference

163
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,759
data set. You have different types of

164
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,360
fellow lost and you you project the

165
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,280
human um data uh which is uh from the

166
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
cancer progression samples. You project

167
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,240
them onto the same coordinate space as

168
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,880
shared by the mouse and you as well you

169
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,759
have the uh confidence as well as you

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,840
have the distributions which is the top

171
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
bottom right and we find the evidence we

172
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,560
want which is this specific type of

173
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,280
fablas uh CCL2

174
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,680
enriched uh which we know it's play

175
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,319
inflammatory role and the larger

176
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,199
population is which means the um the

177
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,280
more therapeutic um uh potentials you

178
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,840
will have. So essentially we we we find

179
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,400
the human has even larger pro proportion

180
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,479
for this specific cell type which stress

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,000
the findings we find in the original

182
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,280
paper and this entire uh workflow this

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,240
entire pipeline um takes uh speak of the

184
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,120
API cost takes less than $3 and the

185
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,520
total uh include a few back and forth uh

186
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,319
from uh between me and the cloud code it

187
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,000
takes like uh less than 20 minutes. So

188
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,840
this is kind of something that is

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,599
already uh functioning and uh make at

190
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,400
least make my life easier and uh also um

191
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,240
to use the AI agent to help with better

192
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,120
science specifically on biomedical

193
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,520
discovery. um is also the vision is

194
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,919
shared by lots of industry leaders um

195
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,560
like anthropic saying uh actually the

196
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,680
CEO is also trained by a biologist back

197
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,440
in um by then he was a PhD and postto so

198
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,200
he's saying the the right way to think

199
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,760
of AI is to treat it as a virtual

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,159
biologist can perform like a co-pilot to

201
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,519
all the tasks human scientist do so not

202
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,600
only uh you know uh like a forward pass

203
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,160
to do like a protein uh structure

204
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
prediction but also to do a complex

205
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
chain of action

206
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,160
towards a high level goal as well as

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
this as well as the simation shared by

208
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,959
by deep mind as as you can see from lots

209
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,279
of their publications as well as openai

210
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:07,120
and a generic um structure of the AI

211
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,600
agents can be show as a left paradigm so

212
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,440
it's powered by a large language models

213
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,480
and it can take actions usually from two

214
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,120
callings nowadays um and have some

215
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,920
impact on the environment environment

216
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,360
can be uh let's say your local

217
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,040
computation platforms as well as I guess

218
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,120
Kashin will show some example like a

219
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,519
manipul like robotic arms to do um more

220
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
uh uh physical interactions with the

221
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,240
work as well you can receive some

222
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,160
feedbacks such as uh from the human such

223
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,760
as from the environment like whether the

224
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,040
code is successful or not whether your

225
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,720
current design is good or not and it

226
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,399
knows when to start as well as when to

227
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,279
stop. This is like a quite high level

228
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,600
but I still like this paradigm. Later on

229
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,040
we will introduce a lot of modules but

230
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,120
which will make the sense more

231
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,880
complicated but essentially it you can

232
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
remember it's powered by large language

233
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,880
models. It's kind take actions to

234
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
influence the environment and receive

235
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,720
the feedbacks from the environment and

236
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,200
adjust itself as well as know when to

237
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,440
stop have also have the interactions

238
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,279
capability with the human. And if we

239
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,519
dive deeper on the agent roughly saying

240
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,839
there's like a three modules inside of

241
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,160
the agent um you have tools which is the

242
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,600
major things to generate actions to

243
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,120
impact environment and the memory is uh

244
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
and the planning you can think of both

245
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,440
of them as as as part of the context. So

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,320
the memory store uh for its goal as well

247
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,839
as the progress and the planning um is

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,360
like make a concrete plan um to um take

249
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,000
action according to the plan roughly

250
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,640
saying something like that and um

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,200
there's many um so for every single uh

252
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,760
module there's many

253
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
techniques that helps the agent to make

254
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,519
better planning make better memory as

255
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,320
well as make um more accurate and

256
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,680
uh concrete actions. So for the first

257
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,560
like I think we we all know like but we

258
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,560
cannot aware that so every um if you

259
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,800
look at some um um public um GitHub um

260
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,040
package you will see that a lot of

261
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,279
prompt instructions nowadays still

262
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,279
involve this basic modules. So one of

263
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,360
the module is called chain of salt. It's

264
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,160
very simple and it's uh but it's so

265
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,720
powerful and elegant. So basically um

266
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,560
what is showing that so instead of just

267
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:36,079
ask the LM um the question you want to

268
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,720
provide example with a few uh chain of

269
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,040
thought process for in the example here

270
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,240
instead of doing a single question on

271
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,000
calculation like a five plus six you

272
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,480
want to uh provide a few short um

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,440
examples for the intask learning for the

274
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,760
LM to capture have a better idea like

275
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,279
what would be the uh inference process

276
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,720
looks like and another thing uh which is

277
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,120
I believe all shared by all the agents

278
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,839
currently is called react so it stands

279
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,639
for reflection and action um so it's

280
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,959
also uh have the similar philosophy as a

281
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,680
chain of thought uh so instead of

282
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:20,079
provide a salting a sync chains it's

283
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,399
provide more like a pardon so ask the

284
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,240
arm to to reflect like what is the

285
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,800
current status what you have information

286
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,680
you have and what's the objective want

287
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,240
to achieve and then to do the actions

288
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,560
and also update its.

289
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,240
So is is this is kind of like a very

290
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,200
generic principles and every

291
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,360
single agent nowadays find they have

292
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,720
some um uh shared statistics in in their

293
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,839
instructions also called prompts

294
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,600
and second next we move to the memory so

295
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,120
the way I think memory is like it's a

296
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,200
it's it's a it's a giant context window

297
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,720
uh it's a intelligent retrieval machine

298
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,519
which allows the agent to to record the

299
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,120
user's behavior as well as the user's

300
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,000
information. So this is like one of the

301
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,480
example we borrowed from MGT. Uh so uh

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,720
it the the memory usually have like few

303
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,639
functions. For instance, like first it

304
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,920
will create a memory. For instance, you

305
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,279
have some interactions with your

306
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,760
chatbot. Uh discuss your birthday and

307
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,320
it's the chatbot will if it's the first

308
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,880
time conversation you discuss on this

309
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,839
topic. The the chatbot will create a

310
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,839
memory to to memorize. Okay. Um uh today

311
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,000
is your birthday February 7 February

312
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,959
7th. And uh later on for your follow or

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,720
for your future conversations your

314
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,320
chatboard or your agent will have the

315
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,800
caveat to retrieve the memories. Uh it

316
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,079
will know you better. It will have more

317
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,199
tailored for your own uh interactions as

318
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,760
well as update like your break up your

319
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,600
uh with your boyfriend or girlfriend. So

320
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:07,839
the memory will also change uh uh to

321
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,440
update its u uh knowledge and you can um

322
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,240
and the system design actually is not

323
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,920
that triple. So in in this paper uh is

324
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,000
one of the representative paper to build

325
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
a memory system for the agents and

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,160
essentially have a lot of um layers and

327
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,600
modules that just help uh the LM to make

328
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,240
a better um use given the budget of its

329
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,680
context window as well to update them

330
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,680
with uh uh with few time latency and you

331
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,199
can easily think of how we can use the

332
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,440
memory in terms of the biomedical

333
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,480
discovery. So it can help to learn the

334
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,639
labs know how I mean even there's like a

335
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,440
100 labs doing perturbation experiments

336
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,839
or analysis there's still different uh

337
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,120
labs you have their different knows and

338
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,519
preference so having inter having a

339
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,839
agents that could memorize the lab know

340
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,399
how the labs taste it will help you

341
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,760
build better workflow and analysis and

342
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:06,160
it help um uh uh also uh tackle the hard

343
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,240
tasks with long horizons of action.

344
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,839
because you have a good memory system,

345
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,639
you can memorize what's your current

346
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,560
stuff because usually there are for

347
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,360
instance like playing Pokemon or um

348
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,440
doing a large simulations the act the

349
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,199
the the time the runtime of agents can

350
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,560
last for hours or days. So in in that

351
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,880
way you want to your memory system um

352
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,399
not only to uh keep a track on

353
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,279
everything but also intelligent

354
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,839
compressed during the it its progress.

355
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,959
So uh having having having a very good

356
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,000
memory system is also kind of crucial

357
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,600
for building an intelligent uh science

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,360
scientific discovery agents and you also

359
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,279
want to avoid your previous failures or

360
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,720
pre failures. Sometimes the larger

361
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,959
language model will make very silly

362
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,040
mistakes. Um you want to avoid that

363
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,759
after you credit it like one or few

364
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,720
times. So memory would help with that

365
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,600
ideally. Um and next we're going to move

366
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,120
on to tools. So the tools I believe is

367
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,920
kind of question you move on

368
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,440
you're outlining these components I'm

369
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,880
curious in practice whether people um to

370
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,279
you know do they fine-tune the models be

371
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,959
like you have the prompt right but do

372
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,279
you also fine-tune the model to be a

373
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,160
good memory system and do you fine-tune

374
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,920
the models to all work together or is it

375
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,639
is it like just just everything is

376
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,120
better specified through the prompt and

377
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,959
um

378
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,759
I actually prefer no fine tune. Many

379
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,040
papers they find tune on let's say llama

380
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:49,360
and usually with a fixed context window

381
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:53,120
like 8k or a few a few a few thousand

382
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,680
key um um but if you look at some like a

383
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,720
very maintained open source project like

384
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,720
some let's say it's called open cloud

385
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
code it's kind of like open source

386
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,280
solution for cloud code they essentially

387
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,319
write a very detailed prompt or detail

388
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:13,679
ask the u on it or uh opus itself to

389
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:17,439
compress the the the contact window

390
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,959
compressor map was kind of that side. So

391
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
speak of the compression, speak of the

392
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
tracking a single run, I feel like it's

393
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,160
more elegant to just

394
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,079
the past in features. But speak of like

395
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,280
a let's say if you have some interaction

396
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,240
with the uh system last year and you

397
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,760
still want to have it to remember such

398
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,520
information like for uh your today's

399
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,360
conversation. Um I I was feel more safe

400
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,919
to build a very intelligent right

401
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:54,640
retrieval system instead of um fine tune

402
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:57,120
a a small uh retriever on um um yeah

403
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
>> I see so there's some choices there but

404
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,240
but I guess beyond the memory there's

405
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,160
also as you saying like the planning

406
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,160
stuff and these components are all

407
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,640
interacting so do people fine-tune them

408
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,640
to like interact in terms of how well

409
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,320
they form on the overall task or is it

410
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
kind of just okay let's build the best

411
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,679
possible memory system let's build the

412
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
best possible planning system let's

413
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,240
build the best possible

414
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,640
tool calling system and then just hope

415
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,640
they work together

416
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
um

417
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,000
I mean there's basically like a two

418
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,919
types of fine tune one is provided fine

419
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,679
tune second is reinforcement fine tune

420
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,000
which are like are basic fine tune um

421
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,080
most

422
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,960
on on both side most way I think is more

423
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,280
like two are tool based it's like you

424
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,679
want it to make optimal plan you make

425
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,200
wanted to find the right argument for

426
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,480
calling the tools um I didn't see many

427
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,760
like a like a join tuning include the

428
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,679
memory system um does that answer your

429
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,080
question

430
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,080
>> question thanks

431
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
I should repeat the

432
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
They're right. We should we should

433
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,280
repeat the question.

434
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,679
Um yeah so the tools tool says um where

435
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,440
you can make a lots of efforts because

436
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,400
it's kind of the sense your the agents

437
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,320
will interact or have uh the impact on

438
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
the environment and there's a different

439
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,799
category of tools for inance you can

440
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,600
have the models or have some binformatic

441
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,640
tools like verse um and you have

442
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,080
database you can look up database um to

443
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,400
uh find the information you need find

444
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,400
the relevant data you need software al

445
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,960
can be also treated as a tool So not

446
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,480
only coding based but also computer use

447
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,679
like you have a graphical user

448
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,000
interface. You can move the mouse, you

449
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,840
can click the button, you can drag the

450
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,600
the menu and select the things you want

451
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,640
and adjust the range uh using drag or

452
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,039
using drag or draw. um coding for sure

453
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,600
nowadays I think we all witness like a

454
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,799
by your own experience uh with using

455
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,559
cursor or cloud code or github copilot

456
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,840
you will see you'll have a sense like

457
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:14,400
how coding uh how how good they're good

458
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,240
at coding nowadays and a a broader view

459
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,960
of tools you can think of like other

460
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,000
agents can be treated as a tools through

461
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,080
more standardized protocol like MCP and

462
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
also like our human sciences can be also

463
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,720
like treated tools to provide additional

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,039
feedbacks or corrections for the agents

465
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,360
behaviors.

466
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,840
Um so this is like our overview on the

467
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,679
modules of agents. You have memory um

468
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,360
you have the planning and you can take

469
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,360
actions by calling the tools

470
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,760
and this is kind of the shared design

471
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,480
for all the works we've been build like

472
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,000
a perable agent. You have actions also

473
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,240
the memory to remember what action

474
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,799
you've done. You have a pool of actions

475
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,520
which a combination of tools and

476
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,520
databases and you have some oblivations

477
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,000
for uh the uh the impact you made on the

478
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,159
data on the environment as well as biom

479
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,559
I think Christian will share more how we

480
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,200
how we build that uh we spend tons of

481
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,480
time on building the tools

482
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,240
also to universe um it's from here uh

483
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:22,240
from maras lab so they also uh push the

484
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,559
extreme of a better tool system like you

485
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,880
want to find the best tools, you want to

486
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,000
call them, uh you want to manage them,

487
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,120
you want to retire some of the less

488
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,200
frequent or unqualified tools as well as

489
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,280
to add new tools, you want to combine

490
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,440
them together, you want to uh u u to

491
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,280
optimize it. Uh let's say if it's a

492
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:49,039
better arguments or it's a better um u

493
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,200
adjust a few lines inside of the tools.

494
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,360
And uh next we're going to talk of some

495
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,400
frontier eye um um of the agents. Um

496
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,440
it's uh it's it's it's I would say it's

497
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,440
um very parallel and I just list all the

498
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,760
topics that come to my head. So it's not

499
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,200
a comprehensive list but I hope it can

500
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,640
give you some um overview of what people

501
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,360
care about uh in the recent

502
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,600
three or six months. Um so first is

503
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,679
multi- aent system. uh I mean there's

504
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,720
already paper published let's say from

505
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,360
James lab which is use a lab of virtual

506
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,520
scientist to help us design a better

507
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,240
antibbody uh sequence for uh covid uh 19

508
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,280
diagnosis um but still I think we're

509
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,919
still waiting or

510
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,640
uh not satisfying like what would be the

511
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,799
best optimal multi-agent system so this

512
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,240
is kind of one of the diagram from uh de

513
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,880
minds co- scientist

514
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,840
So they spend most of their computation

515
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,720
budget on this multi- aent system which

516
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,039
is essentially to create a hypothesis a

517
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,320
useful hypothesis a useful plan

518
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,799
hypothesis and if you think of like the

519
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,760
um and it's more like a role play so

520
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,280
it's using all the same LM but with a

521
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,000
different instance and with different

522
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,320
rules so you can think of the advantage

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,200
body system is like it can speed the

524
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,240
context it can speed the tasks because

525
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,760
Sometimes you have a very complex tasks.

526
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,960
It's always easier to accomplish it by

527
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,360
divide and conquer. So having more

528
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,159
agents that tackle different angles of

529
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,280
this problem will help you to uh achieve

530
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,080
the tasks with a higher success rate and

531
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,280
also it's can add some diversity. For

532
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,559
instance, your agent can have the

533
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,960
different access to the tools. Your

534
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,480
agent have the different expertise. Uh

535
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:49,600
so timeism discuss with each other will

536
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:53,840
help um um some uh like different angles

537
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,679
for the question you care about. Um and

538
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,320
second is

539
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,360
self involve there there should be a

540
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,080
video here which is like a like a like a

541
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,240
like a uh like a Minecraft like a

542
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,640
character in the Minecraft that is like

543
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,240
involved itself. So this is a paper from

544
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,799
Nvidia actually like two years ago. Um

545
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,640
um yeah preprinted like two years ago

546
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:21,520
and the the task is very simple. It's uh

547
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,960
ask the targeter to learn to use a

548
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,559
diamond tools in the Minecraft world. So

549
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,679
actually the diamond tools is one of the

550
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,200
very high-end tools in in the micro mic

551
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,080
Minecraft.

552
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,320
And uh to achieve uh using the diamond

553
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,200
tools, you need to first to develop the

554
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,679
wooden tools which allow you to mine the

555
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,440
stones and and you will have the

556
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,480
capability to create the stone tools and

557
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,960
the iron tools and finally diamond tools

558
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,880
and uh uh they create a reinforcement

559
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,120
learning policy models that uh allows

560
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,159
allows which is more like embody agents

561
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,080
in in that simulation work and to to to

562
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,480
try with different policy to explore and

563
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,720
exploit to find the optimal to find a

564
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,039
way to to create the diamond tools and

565
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,000
have a better survival uh status and uh

566
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,080
this is also used by this this kind of

567
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,919
philosophy is also shared by lots of

568
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,000
recent work like Alfa involve and many

569
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,760
other many other um works.

570
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,080
Next frontier is contact engineering. So

571
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,559
this is kind of like a hacker word like

572
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,159
especially two months ago. Um so

573
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,919
everyone is talking about contacting

574
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
back then and so compared with the

575
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,919
traditional like prompt engineering

576
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,720
which like a single turn query you have

577
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,200
the system prompt um as well as a user

578
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,919
message uh context engineering is more

579
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,559
like a more comprehensive engineering is

580
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,279
you can think it's a nature natural

581
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,600
progression of permanent engineering. So

582
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,640
the reason we need context engineering

583
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,360
is like uh based on two based on two

584
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,799
observations. First we have very limited

585
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,320
context windows. Second we we cannot fit

586
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,559
all the informations. Second is even we

587
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,279
have infinite budget of the context

588
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,760
window thems performance the agent

589
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,840
performance won't be better if we feed

590
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,559
all the informations actually because

591
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,320
the intrinsic computation complexity the

592
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,840
quadratic complexity uh of the

593
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,520
transformer especially calculating the

594
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,080
cross tension scores uh usually the

595
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,640
shorter information shorter accurate and

596
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,640
diverse information provide within the

597
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,480
contact window the better the agent will

598
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,320
perform. It's like you you think of like

599
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,880
annotating like a cell type or doing

600
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,600
some analysis. It's not always like you

601
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,000
provide all the informations we will

602
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,400
have the best annotations. model provide

603
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,960
the most salient uh useful informative

604
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,559
um information to help the agent perform

605
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,720
better uh um for the tasks that you are

606
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,279
interested

607
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,120
and reinforce learning it's also a very

608
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,440
emerging field and especially in the

609
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,760
past months or past one or two months

610
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,640
everyone is talking about

611
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,799
um agentic aisle um lots of people

612
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:12,159
inventing wheels for training a better

613
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,880
um agents under different signals. So

614
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,279
roughly saying there's like um two

615
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,400
modules. You have the trainer which is

616
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,799
which is uh which is um which include

617
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,400
the agent as well as some uh uh

618
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,400
framework um as well as base models and

619
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,919
you have a environment you have a

620
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,919
generator which is generating uh use for

621
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,840
training data. You have an inference

622
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,200
agent which involve like a serving

623
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,559
system as well as the agent which is uh

624
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,200
uh you can think of like a large

625
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,919
language models and it will take um um

626
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,279
actions to uh to the environment you

627
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,000
should you receive signals um uh and you

628
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,080
can update your model from um methods

629
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,080
like a GRP or DPO or different kinds of

630
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,360
ways and even uh and this is very um a

631
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,559
complex engineering um And even for a

632
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,480
single tiny bite of them such as analyze

633
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,799
the model's behavior on the different

634
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,159
signal on the different optimization

635
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:17,120
algorithms um is still there's tons of

636
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,240
papers on that for instance to analyze

637
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,399
how to select the most informative uh

638
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,120
examples the successful traces as well

639
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,399
as the failed traces to uh using the

640
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,480
same algorithm such as GRPO there's at

641
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,159
least you can find like five or 10

642
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,520
papers that just doing this types of

643
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,440
angle analysis. Um

644
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,679
um yeah and it's and it's also worth

645
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,480
mentioning there's two types of RL one

646
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,080
is online one one is offline and and

647
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,039
nowadays the community trend is more

648
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,640
like on online which you can learn and

649
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,200
interact with the environment as well

650
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,880
update model uh update your policy on

651
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:01,880
the same time and frontier another uh

652
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,880
frontier is computer use um

653
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,679
yeah I feel like it's not playing

654
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,679
because we are I'm not connected to the

655
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,440
internet. But essentially uh uh uh a

656
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,919
current trend one of the current trend

657
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,320
on building agent is ask it to use a

658
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,200
computers ask it to move the mouse to

659
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,799
move the to to drag the window for

660
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,840
instance for like cell profiler for um

661
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,960
lots of other uh uh software such as

662
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,640
from 10x genomics such as from uh such

663
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,240
as you're doing some um

664
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,039
fast q files analysis many of such uh

665
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,960
operations are not actually interact

666
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,840
from common lines. You interact them

667
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,720
from uh the graphical interface. You

668
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,159
want so you so in order to have a larger

669
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,240
action space uh uh a capability for the

670
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,880
agents you wanted to use the computers

671
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:01,120
such as like the browsers which uh which

672
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,799
triggered quite some noise yesterday. Um

673
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,640
and for sure the last piece of the

674
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,799
frontier is like to build a better

675
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,679
rubric as well as benchmarks and there

676
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,919
are some efforts on building better uh

677
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,000
comparations of the agents uh such as

678
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,399
agent arena as well as to um uh to to

679
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,279
deliver a better uh user satisfied

680
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,360
results by running multiple agents at

681
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,679
the same time and select the best and

682
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,760
return to the users.

683
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,760
And the last piece of the basic is um

684
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,600
some common failures. I think this is

685
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,520
something that not many people

686
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,600
discussed. I mean we are a bit hijacked

687
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,760
by the promise of the agents. But we

688
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,440
also need to have a sense like what are

689
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,159
the common failures when we build the

690
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,399
agents. So when we start to build the

691
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,200
agents I say like one year and a half

692
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,000
ago or two years ago we encounter a lot

693
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,799
of errors especially silly errors such

694
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,039
as hallucination on some tools that are

695
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,399
not existing or some arguments that are

696
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,520
not um uh that are not defined by the

697
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,000
tools um for instance you you import

698
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,279
some gene labels in the alpha fold which

699
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,679
is not expected and the context overflow

700
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,000
back then is on GP4 it's very easy to

701
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,320
exceed the context window as well as it

702
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,559
has very poor performance to handling

703
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,600
some simple errors such as variable

704
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,520
undefined errors. But nowadays this kind

705
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,679
of errors are very less likely happen uh

706
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,000
thanks to the advancements of building a

707
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,039
better large language model from those

708
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,039
um industry leaders but we still have a

709
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,360
lot of few other um common failures. So

710
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,200
first is like stuck in the loop which

711
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,000
which represents the agent will repeat

712
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,399
the same actions for a few more times

713
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,720
even till the end of your budget and no

714
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,799
finish action. It's kind of similar with

715
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,720
stocking. So stuck in loop is one of the

716
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,240
way to uh have no finish actions. Uh but

717
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,600
there are a few others. It's like the

718
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,200
agent will sometimes just happen to stop

719
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,840
itself from delivering some um final

720
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,000
results or delivering some or or reach

721
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,039
its final budget which is the number of

722
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,200
actions we we preset.

723
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,120
Still it's have a lot of hallucinations

724
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,000
especially we move on to very

725
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,320
specialized domain of the science um as

726
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,120
well as shortcut for instance if you

727
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,440
wanted to if you want agents to analyze

728
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:30,640
like um 100 gigabytes or even larger

729
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,559
files that has like millions of cells or

730
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,120
or other types of information. It's a

731
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,679
it's it's tend to find a shortcut which

732
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,919
is to subsample data or doing lot of

733
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,360
simulations instead of to work on the

734
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,840
actual data as well as trail findings is

735
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,440
like um a lot of a lot of things we find

736
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,519
in today's agents is like either they do

737
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,279
a a lot of hallucination or find some

738
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,919
shortcut

739
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,919
which is something very unrealistic

740
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,799
um or they provide something trail

741
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,960
findings as we all know like a fus exist

742
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,600
in tumor tissues those kind of two

743
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,080
findings. So this is something uh still

744
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,440
exist but despite of this common

745
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,279
features we we uh already observe there

746
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,080
many positive signals in building

747
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,760
agents. So one of the few one of the

748
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,159
example I'm going to share today is we

749
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,799
build for spatial biology. So the reason

750
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,320
we chose spatial biology um because it's

751
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,440
a a very u

752
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,919
a very broad a very vertical field but

753
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,080
it's have high impact. Um for instance

754
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,440
one of the example is like distinguish

755
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,399
cod tumors. Um so the way we design

756
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,320
spatial agent is like we as we shown

757
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,559
before is like it has um um three

758
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,559
modules. You take actions to have impact

759
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,799
to the environment. uh you have the

760
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,679
memory to track your progress and you

761
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,240
can make plans and we choose

762
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,000
representative works from uh every

763
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,799
single stages of the biometical

764
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,960
discovery in the spatial context to

765
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,720
support multiple organs as well as cross

766
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,679
species. Um so uh speak of the time I

767
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,839
will keep the results is in the paper is

768
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,359
like 100 or so pages of manuscript. Um

769
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,679
uh so one of the things we're going to

770
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,679
highlight is that are especially good at

771
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,639
aggregating informations like multiple

772
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,119
layers informations. So here we ask the

773
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,359
LM to look up different database and

774
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,839
select the most informative genes. uh

775
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,000
given it's a few principles such as if

776
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,679
it's if the gene used to name the cell

777
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,159
type which means it's quite important if

778
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,919
the gene you know is included in your

779
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,079
target tissue here is a specific region

780
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,320
in your brain then it's kind of very

781
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,040
important and if it's appear multiple

782
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,639
times it's important so I'm kind doing a

783
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,200
very good job in aggregating different

784
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,399
types of information resource and

785
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,399
ranking them as well as provide reason

786
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,760
in nature languages that are very easy

787
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,520
for us to identify to to justify

788
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,839
Speaking of performance, we compare

789
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,240
mostly with the specialized tools that

790
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,440
people build uh in in this specific

791
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,599
task. It's better uh consistently across

792
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,160
different metrics. We also ask a lots of

793
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,480
human scientists to do the same task

794
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
using the same informations. And so

795
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,240
first observation we made is like a

796
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,960
scientist they are so different. So we

797
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,440
ask like um eight or 10 scientists we

798
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,200
summarize their design panel design

799
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,040
workflow and they are quite quite

800
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,160
different. For instance, some scientists

801
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,800
will just use some existing templates uh

802
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,480
that he he or she has in hand or some

803
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,560
scientist they will do a very detailed

804
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,200
track. They will look multiple data sets

805
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,040
of many literatures as well as some

806
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:49,200
database for pos mark markers to find uh

807
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,400
to add to adjust her his or her design

808
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,720
each um one by one and some just um uh

809
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,960
use some literature as well as a

810
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,720
reference data set. And so what do we

811
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,640
show we compare with special agent and

812
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,200
human scientists we basically can see

813
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,920
that it's performed um the most of the

814
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,200
scientists we the data we collected uh

815
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,520
which are mostly PhD post dog as well as

816
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,640
full-time scientists

817
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,200
and it's kind like 85% of the human

818
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,680
initial designs and also agent plus

819
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,440
human um agent work on the human initial

820
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,599
design is also better than agent alone

821
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,920
so this is what we found uh using GB4 um

822
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,320
nine months ago. uh since might be

823
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,640
different if we switch some more than uh

824
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,800
LMS which we will have in the revised

825
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,760
manuscripts and it's because of the time

826
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,079
and cost it's much cheaper uh compared

827
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839
with the methods that I use GPUs and

828
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,599
also very for sure you can imagine it's

829
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:48,320
cheaper for the scientist because uh we

830
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,119
know the scientist time is very precious

831
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,640
annotations have the similar

832
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,720
um

833
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,400
uh flow um as well as similar

834
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,599
um um performance. It has better than

835
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,079
cell typist some GBT based annotations

836
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,599
as well as most of the human scientists

837
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,040
and we use it to doing mostly to analyze

838
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,119
how the cell cell interact with each

839
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,280
other and different context which here

840
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:20,640
is um a tissue remodeling process and

841
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,119
it's and and as you can imagine lots of

842
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,599
omix based analysis is on comparative

843
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,440
analysis. It's like you have different

844
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,839
conditions, you have different ways of

845
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,760
grouping them and you would just want to

846
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:36,480
group them and to analyze what changes

847
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,680
and what are the intrinsic reasons and

848
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,839
are quite good at doing this um very

849
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,760
standardized or pattern um finding types

850
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,920
of analysis and there are some similar

851
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,560
works that they published uh preprinted

852
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,680
after our work like cell voyager like

853
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,119
paper to code uh both are from uh Jim

854
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,440
Sto's lab and we do some lab validations

855
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,880
which is another manuscript that we hope

856
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,040
we can f hope hope we can share before

857
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,560
the end of this year because there's a

858
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,960
lot of uh um screening policies we need

859
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,040
to make um

860
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,720
and one thing uh I want to say as the at

861
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,000
the time we build special agent we

862
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,599
already considered its extendabilities

863
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,359
um uh so it's like um uh the user make a

864
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,359
message and the agent will decide

865
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:33,680
whether uh the uh the user's task has

866
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:35,839
been encountered has been like baked um

867
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,880
in its previous like a plane templates

868
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,000
or knowhow or SOP uh it's a different

869
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,560
terms but for the same concepts and uh

870
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,960
they if the plane exists and the agent

871
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,119
will make the actions much easier using

872
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,880
the template if it's not the agent will

873
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,359
make the plan on the fly use the tools

874
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,480
it has and

875
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,880
This is kind of the the stages we use

876
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:05,359
like a nine months ago and uh nowadays

877
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,680
there's like a much more um um uh

878
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,599
comprehensive uh modules for this for

879
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,520
instance like a cloud skills. It's kind

880
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,560
of like you provide a a ripple or

881
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,720
provide a folder and the cloud can learn

882
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,720
what is learn the know-hows, learn the

883
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,760
preference, learn how you do the

884
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,240
analysis, how you make the figures from

885
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,960
from the examples you provided and

886
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,680
updates the memory to update its uh uh

887
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,560
plan um in order to make a better

888
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,520
tailored uh user um uh quests.

889
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,079
uh and we show that okay SP region um

890
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,640
thanks to the coding flexibility can do

891
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,800
simple task such as harmonizing

892
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,520
annotations between two different data

893
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,040
sets but can but it's still failed at

894
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:54,640
complex task mostly because uh um we

895
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,520
didn't uh grill its coding capability as

896
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,440
well as we didn't add the uh the tools

897
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,520
that are needed.

898
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,920
So next finally I'm going to talk some

899
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,000
recent works we're about to release. So

900
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,839
I'm so excited for them. Uh so uh

901
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,800
there's there's a few works. So each of

902
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,560
them will be covered by a few slides. Um

903
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,880
so first is like a ination with here um

904
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,119
vian school as well as Tony's group by

905
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,280
Stanford. So we basically didn't use a

906
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,000
very complex agents. We basically use a

907
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,520
coding agent to do a massive mining the

908
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,400
aging agent uh the aging interventions

909
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,760
uh uh using the clock system uh from

910
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,960
Omix data. So the reason the motivation

911
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,040
uh uh we we need a gentic system instead

912
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,359
of like a predefined like a python

913
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,640
programs is uh is because um every

914
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,160
single go study they're different

915
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,200
they're in different formats to record

916
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,960
the metadata. So they're so messy and uh

917
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,920
uh you want you might want to try

918
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,560
different statistical tasks um um based

919
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,440
on your grouping based on your sample

920
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,240
size and uh you want to uh aggregate

921
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,880
multiple informations not only on the

922
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,280
statistical measure like a p values um

923
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,920
but also on how the experiments is

924
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,400
designed what are the relevant what are

925
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,800
the relevant literatures so you kind of

926
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,800
want to have this kind of flexibilities

927
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,839
also because of intrinsic complex text

928
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,720
of of the data. You want to have a more

929
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,240
dynamic or flexible system to to write

930
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,560
code for each single geo data set to to

931
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,200
do some analysis.

932
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,000
And what we find is this is as you all

933
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,440
know this is a typical vikino plot and

934
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,359
uh we show so the color represents uh

935
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,839
how the uh different types of

936
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,240
interventions affects the agent clock

937
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,200
changes and we find one of the

938
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,440
interventions which is open um which we

939
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,720
verified in the white lab we show that

940
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,160
it's actually um could increase the

941
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,560
lifespan of the mouse model and the

942
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:02,000
phenotype uh is basically it's help the

943
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,960
hair to regenerate or regrow from the

944
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
mass models. Um

945
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,400
so I so so the so the example here is

946
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,079
basically I want to say uh in order to

947
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,599
to make the use of agent you don't need

948
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,440
to um build a very comprehensive ones

949
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,000
you just to find what you need and you

950
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,920
can uh easily use some very simple

951
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
agendic structure to help you to um um

952
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,800
meet your need.

953
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,440
Second project is like we're uh building

954
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,720
playing some statistical games. So uh

955
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,839
it's it it's it we use e statistics

956
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,520
which is a method actually using proper

957
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:44,240
from pushing and many others which is

958
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:47,680
like a way to model the um the the

959
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,040
sequential uh statistic the sequential

960
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,119
decision makings. Um so this is like

961
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,839
like one of the example because as we s

962
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,160
as we as as we said agents still make a

963
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,480
lot of silly errors such as you want to

964
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,800
find some uh low side on the chromatin

965
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,640
17 associated with type two diabetes the

966
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,520
agent might sometimes in the middle it's

967
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,480
fine they use a different chromosome

968
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,240
instead of the 17. So, so in that way

969
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:17,359
you want you you want your jar, you want

970
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:19,200
your verifier to um identify that uh and

971
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,440
uh it has some additional advantages

972
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,440
such as you want to uh early terminate

973
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,200
your agent and start a new run or you

974
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,599
want to to save your budget or you want

975
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,400
to provide a measure that the current

976
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,839
agent running is not ideal most likely

977
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,560
to provide a field results. So we use we

978
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:40,319
we call our method called EV E evaluator

979
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,000
which is like a a the sequential

980
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,319
estimation on how the agent will

981
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,599
successfully achieve its tasks and we

982
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,000
show that we find uh with a few serum

983
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,280
proving showing that the the method we

984
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,440
design will have controllable error

985
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
rates as well as optimum power and we

986
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,079
show that compared with raw LMS as a

987
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:05,280
charge we compare with some before

988
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:07,599
roy test as well as some empirical um

989
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,839
baselines. And we show that our method

990
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:14,240
is compare can achieve like a ideal

991
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,440
empirical type to one arrow estimation

992
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,760
as well as to have a better power um

993
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,560
which means you require less samples to

994
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,960
do robust estimations and we show that

995
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,040
it's can generalize across different

996
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,119
data sets for different agentic

997
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,440
architectures. So here is like a from

998
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,800
future house and GSM AK which is a mass

999
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,000
data set and this octo tools another one

1000
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,800
from James O lab and um uh on the

1001
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,920
medical uh uh data sets we show that the

1002
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,760
same our pros method have the same um um

1003
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,400
good performance compared with all the

1004
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,800
baselines and the last project I want to

1005
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:57,520
share very briefly uh is

1006
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,560
I mean we're is a agent that can not

1007
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,160
only coding but also use computers. So

1008
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,000
um we are still designing the name it's

1009
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,160
whether called coco but or co um um but

1010
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,960
essentially uh you'll get a sense of the

1011
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,280
data. So it's it's it's it's

1012
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,040
a multi- aent system and you have two

1013
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,720
agents. One is just doing manipulation

1014
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,400
do operations on the graphical user

1015
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,720
interface. You can have a lot of

1016
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,560
interactions with let's say cell

1017
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,720
profilers or Q pass or napari or

1018
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,720
different types of uh softwares that

1019
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,960
work on let's say cell images and

1020
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,240
another is like a software engineering

1021
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,119
agents that can mostly uh run a lot of

1022
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,359
code and can robust recover from

1023
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,920
different error messages as well as for

1024
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:47,440
a long horizon task and these two agent

1025
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,079
can communicate um with each other and

1026
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,359
collaborate to to achieve a very complex

1027
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,160
task especially uh complex if we think

1028
00:45:53,359 --> 00:46:01,119
of another layer of modality for cell

1029
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:04,400
images and we compare some baselines uh

1030
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,079
this baseline so for this type of so the

1031
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,359
right is like a two example one is

1032
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,319
generated from the agent when is

1033
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,839
generated from the tutorial where is

1034
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,440
downloaded from the tutorial on cell

1035
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,920
profiler which we treated as a ground

1036
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,800
tru and we show that this complex task

1037
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,319
it cannot be achieved by a single lm um

1038
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:25,920
because it doesn't have access to to to

1039
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:30,160
to us provider to doing some data

1040
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,319
analysis on on on your image and u we

1041
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,079
compare with a few baselines we encrypt

1042
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:38,960
the bomin because it's original design

1043
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,839
for coding but I know there um uh uh

1044
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,560
there um yeah so we we compare with the

1045
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,599
coding versions of bom mini equipped

1046
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,440
with a cell profiler we also doing two

1047
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,160
types of version of our own method. One

1048
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,400
is just on coding, one is use both

1049
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:59,440
coding as well as the computers and we

1050
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,119
show that um um it has a very

1051
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,599
um

1052
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,000
good better performance than most of the

1053
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,240
methods. uh not only on the in-domain

1054
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,280
test which is like a trend test split on

1055
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,760
the subprofiler which are like 20

1056
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,400
different samples data as well as uh

1057
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,280
different tasks but also for the out of

1058
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,200
domain task which is we download the

1059
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,800
most hard challenges from the online

1060
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,119
forums that is not encountered or uh

1061
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,040
included in the self profiler official

1062
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:33,119
tutorial and many of them have open

1063
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,000
solutions

1064
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,520
and speak and we also analyze when the

1065
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,440
computer use is necessary. So

1066
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,800
essentially you can think of you can see

1067
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,880
that our system essentially use tons of

1068
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,200
computer um use softwares such as to

1069
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,480
validate to ver to verify your results

1070
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,839
as well as to adjust the parameters such

1071
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:59,599
as the um the range in the threshold to

1072
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:03,040
to to to color your cells to to dye your

1073
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,400
cells. um um as well as to just build

1074
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,079
from scratch which is like move the

1075
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,880
button from beginning to drag the data

1076
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,800
file into serif window and drag the

1077
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,520
manual to find the corresponding

1078
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:18,160
functions and doing some analysis.

1079
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,000
So to recap so we um share the vision u

1080
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,400
many of you shared as well like the

1081
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,880
agent as a scientist co-pilot and we

1082
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,640
talk about the basics of agents uh we

1083
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,760
talk about it modules uh um and we talk

1084
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,559
about the frontiers topics as well we um

1085
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,119
share uh some common failures why we

1086
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,800
build these agents and we introduce some

1087
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,760
specialized agent we build for spatial

1088
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:45,440
biology uh we build it uh uh in the

1089
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,359
light of to compare most of the

1090
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,280
specialized domain tools. We didn't

1091
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,920
compare with other agent but more we

1092
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:57,359
want to show the agents can offer some

1093
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,119
um performance gains across some like a

1094
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,920
previous computation method like whether

1095
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:05,440
it's a transformer or incoder or some

1096
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,440
statistical based methods um uh and we

1097
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,200
have some manuscript to do lots of wet

1098
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:14,960
lab verifications and uh I share some

1099
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,200
works that is soon be released uh um

1100
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,119
master mining agent interventions

1101
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,119
validations using sequial hypothesis

1102
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,800
testing framework as well as doing

1103
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,400
coding and computer use at the same

1104
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,280
time. Um so finally I want to sh my

1105
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:33,839
mentors this is because there are so

1106
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:36,559
many authors I um I I kind of lazy

1107
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,480
didn't list all the um people's

1108
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,760
essentially this is one of slide I

1109
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,280
borrow from uh one of my previous uh um

1110
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,079
presentations. I want to thank my

1111
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:50,960
mentors and the cortium special agent as

1112
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:53,520
well as um a portable agent vi many uh

1113
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:58,680
agents and many works mentors and

1114
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,680
mentees and uh thanks for listening.

1115
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,960
>> You have questions let me know.

1116
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,800
Hi. Um I I was wondering if you think

1117
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,319
that for example you could have an agent

1118
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,400
but without the LLM component because I

1119
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,880
know that the LLM component is providing

1120
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,760
a lot of the underlying reasoning for a

1121
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,839
lot of these uh agentic workflows but

1122
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,640
it's also providing the knowledge source

1123
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:36,720
as well where like you know if you ask

1124
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,559
it to run a single cell pipeline you

1125
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,559
know the agent probably is drawing from

1126
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,800
a lot of that pre-trained data that's

1127
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,040
been mined from the literature. So I was

1128
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,200
just wondering how you differentiate,

1129
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,079
you know, agents as a whole versus the

1130
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,359
LLM field as a whole or there sounds

1131
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:56,000
like they're inherently intertwined.

1132
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,760
M

1133
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,160
>> um

1134
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,559
yeah actually so as you know the agent

1135
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:07,119
concept is developed better or proposed

1136
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:09,440
earlier than the LM um for in this paper

1137
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,440
they didn't use large anchorage model

1138
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,359
for I mean they use some visual models

1139
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,680
for instance on the very early stages

1140
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,400
like um from deep mind they developed

1141
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,480
some firmware called hide and seek so

1142
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,599
basically the you know that in that way

1143
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,720
it's It's not agent more as in it's not

1144
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,640
LM power agent more used to analyze the

1145
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,760
reinforce learning how the emerging

1146
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:38,000
behavior happens in the multi- reinforce

1147
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:42,079
learning um um policy uh powered agents

1148
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,640
um I think um for now it's like for sure

1149
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,160
um mostly agent we're talk about today

1150
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,920
or talk about by the committee is

1151
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,800
powered by large models and it's

1152
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:55,680
avoidable that is has some bias

1153
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,800
inherited from its training data. Um

1154
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,760
so so first it's getting better and

1155
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:06,319
better for base models. Um uh yeah uh

1156
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,400
there there are some uh people are

1157
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,119
showing that for some data set like GPQA

1158
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,040
or graduate level science you the agent

1159
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:17,680
are already have better performance than

1160
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:20,000
the average PhD. Second it's um our

1161
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,880
human self is also have bias right I

1162
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,440
mean you can read 10 different cells

1163
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,520
papers they have their own bias to do

1164
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,359
the analysis to do the figures to tell

1165
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:35,280
the story as well so um one of the way

1166
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:38,480
to uh to alleviate the amount bias from

1167
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,800
the LM and to bake your own bias we

1168
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,440
think is like uh for instance like I

1169
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,119
think cloud skills or some memories or

1170
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,680
um

1171
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,400
like a more better context engineering

1172
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,240
could help that.

1173
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,240
Yeah, I'm not sure does it answer your

1174
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,240
question.

1175
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,920
Uh very nice work. I have a question

1176
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,839
just out of curiosity. Do you guys

1177
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,599
observe any two usage preference for the

1178
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,359
agents? For example, you have multiple

1179
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,599
tools doing the same thing. Does the

1180
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:12,319
agent prefer to use one over the other?

1181
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:16,240
I assume like most humans do have their

1182
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:18,160
own preference but not about agents.

1183
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,520
Um

1184
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:25,359
yeah so we do have so like uh I would

1185
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,440
say cloud 3.7 start from cloud 3.7 it's

1186
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,960
tend to use coding itself instead of to

1187
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,800
calling like a lot of predefined tools.

1188
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,680
It's feel I feel like it's more like

1189
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:40,079
from the training side. It's like I I

1190
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:45,839
feel like it's it's the training of 3.74

1191
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:48,880
4.5 Sonet is um compared with the

1192
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:50,559
product of color code. So they want to

1193
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,680
train the model in order to have a very

1194
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,720
good coding capabilities. Uh so instead

1195
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:59,200
of you know from the tools we predefined

1196
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,960
such as some like scampy or some other

1197
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,200
different type of tools. And the

1198
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,920
question for that for for your specific

1199
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,880
question I feel like um this is

1200
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,319
something I didn't I I we realized but I

1201
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,720
didn't find an elegant solution. It's

1202
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:15,119
like for a single task you can have

1203
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,599
several ways. You can use skumai can use

1204
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,400
sat you can use different type of things

1205
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,559
to do like a differential expression.

1206
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,119
Just let's say differential expression a

1207
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:29,200
simple example. Um for different data

1208
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,200
you might want to use a different for

1209
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,359
sure parameters for the same package as

1210
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,839
well as different packages.

1211
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:38,559
um in building in building of this I'm

1212
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,000
I'm not sure about the uh situation of

1213
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,160
the two universe but in building of the

1214
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,280
operation we're trying to kind of a bit

1215
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,880
uh centralize the tools we did we try to

1216
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,000
avoid duplication of the tools for the

1217
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:57,520
same purpose but uh ultimately I think

1218
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,280
it will be better if someone or or from

1219
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,079
our side we can propose something that

1220
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,960
agent will try a lot of different

1221
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,240
solutions

1222
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,359
like different tools, different

1223
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,359
arguments and propose. Okay, this one is

1224
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,440
optimal in my hand. Currently, it's more

1225
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:14,000
like a one time pass even if you look at

1226
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,920
the it's it's kind of like it makes a

1227
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,440
plan at the beginning and just make

1228
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,800
actions according to the plan maybe

1229
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,319
adjust the plane in the middle but

1230
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,040
essentially as long as it has a final

1231
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:25,040
result and then it's stopped. It won't

1232
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,319
okay I have one version of the result

1233
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,960
then I start from the beginning.

1234
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:32,160
Currently we don't have such

1235
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,839
thing. Um but I I I believe have such

1236
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:41,160
kind of thing will make a better um

1237
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:41,160
deliverable things. Thanks.

1238
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,240
>> Um for people who have done a bunch of

1239
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,000
computation in their life but haven't

1240
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,640
really jumped into this yet, do you have

1241
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,640
like a quick recommendation of where you

1242
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,319
would go to try building out one of

1243
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,319
these? Let's say you had a computational

1244
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,599
task, a machine learning algorithm

1245
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,720
you're trying to build or something like

1246
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,359
that. This world of like there's lots of

1247
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,400
choices out there at this point. Can you

1248
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,559
offer some recommendation as to what to

1249
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,000
try first and why? Or does do you need

1250
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,599
more specifics on the problem? Let's say

1251
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,720
it's a pure data science problem. It's a

1252
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,240
pure like there's a lot of data and you

1253
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,680
just but there's a lot of pieces you

1254
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,680
need to connect together to get it to

1255
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,680
work.

1256
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,079
I

1257
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,799
yeah if we think of like a resource uh

1258
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,920
like a like something to read I would

1259
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:37,359
have a very heavy bias to read something

1260
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,119
from like anthropic I really enjoy

1261
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,720
reading their blogs especially engineer

1262
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,119
blogs

1263
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,400
like a reading like if you start from

1264
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,559
something reading to understand the

1265
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,200
basic concepts I would start from

1266
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,200
reading blogs from anthropic they are

1267
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,200
very

1268
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,359
aggressive in in pushing the agentic

1269
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:02,480
power for large language models. If you

1270
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:07,599
think of um um a very good open source

1271
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:10,640
packages, I I would recommend Bowin and

1272
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,440
Bowin which Kushin will introduce in the

1273
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:18,160
next talk. um as well as some like

1274
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:20,400
existing like a um like a like a like a

1275
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,480
project like a sweet agent which is like

1276
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,119
push the boundary of the coding cer base

1277
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,960
of the agents. uh for your own need, you

1278
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,440
might want to first like figure out like

1279
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,960
what kind of the tools or functions you

1280
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:35,440
want to have. Um and you find something

1281
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:41,119
that is very easy to extendable such as

1282
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:44,160
biomin to to to add them. Um yeah um I

1283
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:48,400
think personally now is like we spend uh

1284
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:52,240
our time is um saved a lot by using like

1285
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:56,000
a coding um uh assistance such as cursor

1286
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:58,880
and call code and u you could also like

1287
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,559
um uh you you find some aentic framework

1288
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,400
you want to work with and you download

1289
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,960
some tools that or local tools you want

1290
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,799
to use and you can just translate the

1291
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,040
tools that are in that are be callable

1292
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:13,119
by the your agentic framework just to

1293
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,960
use like the cursor or cloud code

1294
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,040
provided a few example and some

1295
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,680
instructions and this can do a quite

1296
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,680
decent job with a few rounds of

1297
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,680
interactions

1298
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,680
I'm going to move on to the next speaker

1299
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,599
just for the sake of time but they will

1300
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,520
be sticking around afterwards if you

1301
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,319
have more burning questions for him

1302
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,200
thank you so much thank you so much for

1303
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,440
for being here. Yeah.

1304
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,079
>> Heshan recently defended his PhD at

1305
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,640
Stanford um in computer science also

1306
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,640
with Yuri Laskcock's group. Um his work

1307
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,839
also broadly focuses on AI and biio

1308
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,680
medicine mainly looking at like

1309
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:52,720
multimodal modeling therapeutics

1310
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,640
development. Um GNN's agentic systems

1311
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,079
for scientific hypothesis testing which

1312
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:00,319
I'm sure we'll hear a lot more about

1313
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:02,799
today. Um he's a Stanford Biox um SIGF

1314
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:05,119
fellow. Um, and recent projects include

1315
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,799
what we just mentioned with Biom, um, an

1316
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,000
agent for biomedical sciences, and we're

1317
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,480
really excited to hear more about it.

1318
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,599
Thank you.

1319
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,119
>> Great. Um, thank you.

1320
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,119
>> Can you guys hear me?

1321
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,680
>> Cool. Um, really excited to hear and

1322
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:19,839
share about some of our recent works.

1323
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,440
The title is building a virtual AI

1324
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:24,799
scientist. Um so I will probably give

1325
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,880
really really quick introduction because

1326
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:29,280
Henry has already covered a lot of the

1327
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,440
motivation of why we're building a kind

1328
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,880
of a virtual scientist and then I'll

1329
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,000
delve into our methods and also show

1330
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,319
some recent work. So as you probably all

1331
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,079
know bat discovery super fundamental

1332
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:42,880
impact all kinds of different industries

1333
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:46,079
ranging from drug discovery diagnosis

1334
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,920
even like agriculture and so on. But if

1335
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:51,520
we look at the day-to-day life of a

1336
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,200
biologist um they're actually a lot of

1337
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,280
time they're not doing science they're

1338
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,960
doing like this manual complex tasks

1339
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,000
right because real real world discovery

1340
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,319
is extremely slow messy and complex for

1341
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,799
for some examples like some papers on

1342
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,200
some databases actually talking talking

1343
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:09,760
some colleagues no one knows everything

1344
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,720
um if you're a wab scientist if you want

1345
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,240
to run some data analysis you need to

1346
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,839
engage with some bathematician or

1347
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,760
computer biologist and wait for a few

1348
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,960
days and come back with the result and

1349
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,280
then design some molecule with some

1350
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,520
legacy tools, draft protocols, other

1351
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,359
materials and so on so on. In the end

1352
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,920
you get some potentially useful sub

1353
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:31,359
results and the best case if take months

1354
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,440
if not years uh to get it done. So this

1355
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,520
basically motivates us to say okay part

1356
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,480
of reason biomeic progress is limited by

1357
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,000
you know lack of crazy innovative ideas.

1358
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,400
Another reason is just limited by human

1359
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,079
bandwidth. there just so much data

1360
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,480
generated because of the new sequencing

1361
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,720
technology out there. when we talk to a

1362
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,720
lot of labs uh PIs they just complain

1363
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,720
right they have 80% data just sit there

1364
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,640
no one's analyzing it and then there's

1365
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,400
also many scientists they have tons of

1366
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,400
innovative ideas because of the limits

1367
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,799
of bandwidths they can only do like one

1368
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,720
test one idea at a time so this

1369
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,559
gradually means that as the time goes by

1370
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,880
the supply of these biomeatic expertise

1371
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,200
just grows very very linearly founded by

1372
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,280
the human uh but the demand of it just

1373
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,119
grows exponentially so there's a huge

1374
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,839
gap and the gap is basically the missing

1375
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,680
insights the missing discoveries

1376
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,520
So in order to close this gap we need a

1377
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,440
new way of scaling this kind of a

1378
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,680
expertise

1379
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,599
and we're able to see that in AI agents

1380
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,760
in other domains it's able to scale this

1381
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,000
expertise for example in coding the

1382
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,119
cursor right and the legal industry this

1383
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,119
hobby and the agent hung already give a

1384
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,480
really great great in-depth uh

1385
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,319
introduction so I don't need to delve

1386
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,280
into it but we're thinking can we extend

1387
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:43,920
this AI agent to bio medicine and we do

1388
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,960
believe that future biology is agentic

1389
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,359
um one created a virtual AI biologist

1390
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,520
automate bi research and there's a lot

1391
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:53,760
of benefits that it can brings right

1392
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,920
because for for example like now it can

1393
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,839
perform task much much faster but when

1394
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm seeing many many examples where it

1395
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,640
took months of work now it takes minutes

1396
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,760
and also it enables uh tackling many

1397
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,599
tasks at the same time because

1398
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,200
everything happen in silicon so you can

1399
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,119
actually have 20,000 agent working for

1400
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,680
you at the same time if you want so this

1401
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,760
actually remove cost of problem that we

1402
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,640
met before for example P4 you because

1403
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,960
you can

1404
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,480
one gene at a time you you have the gene

1405
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,400
selection problem but now if you have

1406
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,480
20,000 gene then you can just have

1407
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,480
20,000 agent looking at one gene for

1408
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,440
each right so there's a lot of problem

1409
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,680
can be solved with agent that's kind of

1410
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,960
impossible before and also of course it

1411
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,960
because of the reasoning ability the

1412
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,319
intelligence layer can also suggest and

1413
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,839
explore novel hypothesis as well

1414
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:40,000
so we think this is a new way of doing

1415
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,760
biome research so in the future it's

1416
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,839
hard to imagine there's still still

1417
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,119
people spending all this manual complex

1418
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:49,839
It's like this kind of artisan in era in

1419
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:51,920
contrast to uh here right now in the

1420
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:54,400
future biologist will be working with a

1421
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,400
class of a team of AI agent just get all

1422
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:01,200
the task done and the impact is like uh

1423
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,799
a single biologist now can be have equal

1424
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,400
to impact of entire specialist team like

1425
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,640
genetic geneticist can actually now

1426
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,880
design proteins uh while lab scientists

1427
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,119
can now do all the bionformatics tasks

1428
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,720
and so on and also this is a great

1429
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,720
democratization tool as well like great

1430
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,760
education tool Because now if we can

1431
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,079
encode all the knowledges from uh here

1432
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,799
um and then in into the agent and then

1433
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,319
distribute it to anyone uh on earth then

1434
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:27,200
we're dramatically reducing the barrier

1435
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:30,079
and everyone has the same educations and

1436
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,240
also it's also the first time where the

1437
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,440
every step of the discovery process are

1438
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,119
being documented um because agent does

1439
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,359
everything right. So you have the very

1440
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,920
granular step of okay is you using this

1441
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:44,400
tool and then that that tool. So it it

1442
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,079
becoming a a record um so it's also

1443
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,160
becoming a system record that can of the

1444
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,880
of the discovery process itself. This

1445
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,720
this also has a lot of new way uh a lot

1446
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,240
of benefits as well. So overall we think

1447
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,559
this is kind of new way of doing bal

1448
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,280
research. Um so this talk we're

1449
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:02,000
basically trying to uh motivate uh this

1450
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,760
is great but also I guess more d into

1451
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,039
more technical side which is how do we

1452
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,039
build such a a biologist.

1453
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,280
So to build such a biologist we also

1454
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,119
need to look at how does a bi biology

1455
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,359
research being done today. So here I'm

1456
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:19,119
giving extremely high level some uh kind

1457
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:20,960
of overview. Um so as to broadly uh you

1458
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,960
need to generate a hypothesis for

1459
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,960
example this is a hypothesis and usually

1460
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,400
how you generate generate hypothesis

1461
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,559
through reasoning through reading some

1462
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,960
papers also doing some kind of analysis

1463
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:33,039
as well and then given hypothesis you

1464
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,119
need to validate it. So typically for

1465
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,599
example bio statistician could look at

1466
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,599
these multimodel data sets and then

1467
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,319
write some simple scripts to generate p

1468
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,599
values or it could be a more targeted

1469
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,960
web experiment for example knocking out

1470
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,799
the gene and see what's the phenotype

1471
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,640
changes but overall you're able to see

1472
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,720
that generating hypothesis and eving

1473
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:54,400
hypothesis it involves multiple

1474
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,680
individual tasks um and then to to do

1475
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,880
this kind of a more high level um high

1476
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,799
level kind of a task. So if we summarize

1477
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,240
in a nutshell, we have the auto loop

1478
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:06,240
which is the hypo generation and a

1479
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,319
validation loop and once it's validated

1480
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,480
you can you basically add it to your own

1481
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:13,359
knowledge and then you can generate more

1482
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,359
hypothesis. Um so there's auto loop and

1483
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,920
within auto loop each step there's

1484
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:20,880
massive number of individual tasks and

1485
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,079
the and workflows. So if we model

1486
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,520
biomeical research in this way then it

1487
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,680
basically naturally gives us a recipe

1488
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,599
for building a biologist. Basically we

1489
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,039
need a generous biomeic agent that can

1490
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,440
perform all kinds of different

1491
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,200
individual tasks and then we also have a

1492
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,200
genic system when we can just compose

1493
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,799
everything together uh and and then to

1494
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,200
do the generation and validation of

1495
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:43,839
hyposis.

1496
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,440
So this talk I going to focus on the the

1497
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,799
on the foundation layer which is the

1498
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,039
generous biomeic agent which is called

1499
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,520
biom. Uh but we also have some work

1500
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,880
which I'll briefly in two slides talk

1501
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,520
about as well in generation and

1502
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,280
validation as well. uh but I gonna spend

1503
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,960
the most time talking about the biom

1504
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,960
project.

1505
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,920
So yeah so I guess I want to first

1506
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,599
acknowledge my co-authors uh biom is a

1507
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,319
it's a big project collaborating with

1508
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:10,079
amazing people Serena Henchan here Jerry

1509
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:13,440
and Ma and also with our collaborators

1510
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:15,599
and adviserss as well.

1511
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,240
So now we're looking at each individual

1512
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,880
tasks. Now if we zoom in uh if you look

1513
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,720
at uh how how how is the task get done

1514
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,359
it's usually a loop of reasoning and

1515
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,119
actions. So you reason about it and then

1516
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,880
you think about it and then you perform

1517
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,000
some stuff and then you look at the

1518
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,599
result from that um kind of actions and

1519
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,920
then you you will inform you then make

1520
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,440
the next step and then just continues.

1521
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,760
So it's like this kind of the loop of

1522
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,599
reasoning actions and we know there's

1523
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,799
recently there's tons of progress in LM

1524
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:46,079
reasoning um uh but actually the

1525
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,599
biometical action space is like

1526
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,520
undefined.

1527
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:53,920
So what do we mean? Basically the LM um

1528
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:55,920
is like it's kind of disconnected to the

1529
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,760
all the things that a biologist have

1530
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,480
access to right. So the machine

1531
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:03,839
predictors what experiments database

1532
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,960
mathematics tools so and also so

1533
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,359
basically the challenge is that we don't

1534
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,039
have an environment um almost like a

1535
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:11,280
scientist just keep thinking without

1536
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,480
doing anything just then you can you

1537
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,720
cannot do like real real discoveries.

1538
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,640
So our motivation is okay so there's no

1539
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,400
environment let's just build a one then

1540
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,160
the first challenge is like biometic

1541
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,640
action space is super super large

1542
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,559
complex and scattered so we need we need

1543
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,200
a method try to create an action space

1544
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:32,319
at the first place

1545
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,640
so we create a a new method uh we we

1546
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:37,359
look at bio archive because in bio

1547
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:40,079
archive there's like 25 subjects and it

1548
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:42,880
covers the biology very broadly and then

1549
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:45,280
in each subject of the bio archive we

1550
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,440
retrieve 100 recent publish papers and

1551
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,960
then for each paper we ask another agent

1552
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,400
which is called our action discovery

1553
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,400
agent read through each chunk of the

1554
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,760
paper and ask the agent okay what kind

1555
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,119
of tool what kind of software what kind

1556
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,799
of databases that are necessary to

1557
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,160
reproduce the result in that chunk of

1558
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,319
the paper if it's if it's rep uh uh so

1559
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,000
after screening it for like 2500 papers

1560
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:06,400
you get a collection of tools software

1561
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,760
databases and uh if you think about

1562
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,119
theoretically speaking if you

1563
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,440
implemented everything really really

1564
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,359
quite correctly then you can kind of

1565
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,000
reproduce all of these recent published

1566
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:18,400
papers in an automatic fashion given the

1567
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,400
um reasoning abilities is really good.

1568
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,440
So but of course that's seriously

1569
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:25,920
relatively speaking um but but I think

1570
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:29,679
after this step you'll get a a good

1571
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:32,159
snapshot of the possible um action space

1572
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:35,120
out there. This is our kind of northstar

1573
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:37,600
but it's actually not implemented yet.

1574
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,600
So then we go ahead and then try to

1575
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,000
implement some of it. But because there

1576
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,159
were just thousands of kind of thousands

1577
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,679
of tool and then databases and students

1578
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,440
were scattered. Um so for our the first

1579
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,400
version we just picked the most popular

1580
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,799
and the most frequent uh subset of it

1581
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:57,199
and we initially also tried to let to

1582
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:59,040
create its own just have like action

1583
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,759
generation agent as well. It just does

1584
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,600
not perform really well. So here we we

1585
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,080
curate like a manually kind of a very

1586
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,839
high quality um subset of it which is

1587
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:10,799
called a biome E1. E stands for

1588
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:12,880
environment. So in this environment we

1589
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,279
decompose it into three parts. The first

1590
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,480
part is the software. So these include

1591
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:21,359
our packages like D62. Um there's also

1592
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,359
Python packages like biopython

1593
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:28,960
image and there's also command line

1594
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:32,000
tools like CCTA um um muscle and so on.

1595
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:35,279
So, so, so here we actually we're not

1596
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,719
defining predefined functions but just

1597
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:40,560
we just create a single like software

1598
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:43,040
environment that's compatible with all

1599
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,480
of these and then the LM because it has

1600
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,560
read all the documentation of these

1601
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,279
popular softwares you can automatically

1602
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,759
generate code to get a task done and

1603
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:54,320
this is much more flexible compared to

1604
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,719
predefine some functions uh based on

1605
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,560
these softwares

1606
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,560
and then there's the databases So for

1607
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,920
these databases it includes like nomad

1608
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:06,800
open genetics binding DB by gene regular

1609
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,960
DB clean and so on so there's fitting 59

1610
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,880
of these and it consists of two parts as

1611
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,440
well. The first part is this more

1612
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,640
massive web databases like terabytes of

1613
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,960
data. So for that uh you can also define

1614
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,960
a large number of like predefined

1615
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,120
functions to cover this ID to that ID

1616
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,679
for example. But we think if I want to

1617
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,440
be g general we're actually using a sub

1618
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,000
agent uh that takes in a natural

1619
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,400
language query and have another LM to

1620
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,400
generate the SQL and the kind of graphql

1621
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,960
queries to extract the relevant data

1622
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,120
sets on on the fly. So this way it's not

1623
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,840
it's much more flexible. Of course,

1624
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,760
that's the web to large web databases

1625
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,520
and there's also the data leaks where

1626
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,640
these are like private like like a list

1627
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,480
of files uh where there's no API

1628
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,320
endpoint uh but it's just like a raw

1629
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,199
data data sets with like pandas data

1630
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:57,520
frames and and so on. So the software

1631
01:10:55,199 --> 01:11:00,560
and databases are at are the core but we

1632
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:02,159
also know um kind of actually sometimes

1633
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,560
cannot generate on on its own because

1634
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:07,360
there's so much private knowledge uh in

1635
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,360
in our medicine so much knows and also

1636
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:12,880
there's also involve tools that are

1637
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:15,600
really complex. So here we we include uh

1638
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,440
only tools that are very hard for our to

1639
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,360
generate on its own. So these are the

1640
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,360
specialist tools that's how we define

1641
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,520
it. So this include like for example you

1642
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,159
want to predict adamat property you need

1643
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,960
some proprietary models. If you are

1644
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:32,000
doing some wab cloning pro wab uh

1645
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:34,159
protocols uh so we need to like manually

1646
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,560
talk to some lab to grab some protocols

1647
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:40,000
from them. If you are working on some AI

1648
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:43,120
models like UC if dog so these will

1649
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,199
tools that we give the LM access to in

1650
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:49,120
our first environment.

1651
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:51,199
Cool. So that's the E1. And next uh we

1652
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:53,440
also build a agent that kind of

1653
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,280
customized for this environment um

1654
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,920
because this is a the first environment

1655
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,080
that's really massive a huge um compared

1656
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:03,199
to the other like environment like for

1657
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:06,320
example it's like 20 tools and a very

1658
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:08,960
simple software environment. So in order

1659
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,960
for to accommodate this this this new

1660
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,440
environment we develop some customized

1661
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,679
modules. But first of all for example

1662
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,760
retrieval um because you cannot put

1663
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,600
everything into the context of uh like

1664
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,040
it's just so much of them also most of

1665
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,440
them are actually not relevant for the

1666
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,280
question at hand. So for this single

1667
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,960
given a question we have a retrieval

1668
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,719
step which basically retrieve the most

1669
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,480
relevant subset of tools software and

1670
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:33,040
databases that are needed to answer this

1671
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,239
question and uh for the retrieval we

1672
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,400
also experiment on different kind of

1673
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:37,920
techniques. Um and in the end we

1674
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,400
realized that actually retrieval also

1675
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,400
requires reasoning ability as well. So

1676
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,960
uh we we have we put another sub agent

1677
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:48,239
that does the retrieval as well. So in

1678
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,800
the end it will get a subset of of of

1679
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:54,960
relevant resources. So almost like a sub

1680
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:57,280
environment just designed for this task

1681
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,040
and after you retrieve it then you can

1682
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:02,080
do reason about it. You you need to

1683
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:04,719
think okay what's the steps uh needed to

1684
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:06,080
utilize this resources to and also the

1685
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:09,280
reasoning abilities to answer the

1686
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:11,600
question at hand. So here in biom we a1

1687
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:14,000
we kind of prompted to create a plan on

1688
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,840
the fly. So part of reason is like we

1689
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,320
want to be a general purpose agent. We

1690
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,920
don't want to be like a a very very

1691
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,440
focused agent. Part of reason is like we

1692
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,679
know in the day-to-day life of a

1693
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,640
scientist there just so much tasks so

1694
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:28,400
much diverse task. Um if you are using

1695
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,920
like each point solutions then you're

1696
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,159
still kind of a need to switching

1697
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,000
different tools. It's kind complic

1698
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,840
complicated but if it's like a single

1699
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
general purpose agent that you can tap

1700
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,719
in any question and it give you some

1701
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,239
answers just much more convenient. Um

1702
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,600
but in order to do that then you will

1703
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:47,840
need you cannot like predefine workflows

1704
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,280
or like predefine like a concrete steps

1705
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,760
for every task out there because there's

1706
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:55,040
so much task right that's part of reason

1707
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:58,000
we want the LM to generate on on fly uh

1708
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,840
the the plans to tackle any any given

1709
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,239
questions and we're pretty surprised to

1710
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,159
find out is actually has read all the

1711
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:06,320
papers and all the literatures and all

1712
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,640
the all the internet so he's able to

1713
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,560
generate a pretty reasonable plan um and

1714
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,480
of course there's some very very

1715
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,800
specialist task and we have some other

1716
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:17,280
approach trying to tackle that but for

1717
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,920
the most common popular tasks we're able

1718
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,840
to observe that the plan generally by

1719
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,800
the LM that's pretty reasonable to give

1720
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,040
you answer and also the plan is actually

1721
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,239
tracked along the entire process uh

1722
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,719
maybe because there's some maybe

1723
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:32,080
sometimes in the middle there's some uh

1724
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,080
wrong answers and then you need to

1725
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:38,400
update the plan it will also also

1726
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:41,040
automatically up the plan as well

1727
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,800
cool so now you have a plan now you need

1728
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:45,040
to really get a task done right you need

1729
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,640
to perform the steps so for each step of

1730
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:52,480
plan uh we use uh coding as a way to to

1731
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:54,480
to solve um to kind of perform the step

1732
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,640
so uh I think this [clears throat] kind

1733
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,159
of already become almost like a standard

1734
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,960
as h mentioned with the call code and

1735
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:04,400
things like that like when we develop it

1736
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,719
actually um uh it's actually like one

1737
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,800
half years ago so it was still a bit

1738
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,360
unclear like coding is the way to do uh

1739
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,600
but For us, we are using coding because

1740
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,920
it's almost like a necessity because for

1741
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,159
our environment, we don't define any

1742
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,239
prespecified functions on the softwares.

1743
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:22,960
So it has to use coding to execute these

1744
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:25,040
softwares and also we wanted to interle

1745
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,760
the software databases and prescite tool

1746
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,760
intelligence. So coding is a basically a

1747
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,760
way of general task solving uh that can

1748
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,840
interle them and also can do like more

1749
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,320
complex logics for example for loop if

1750
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,640
and else uh this just gives much more

1751
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,400
flexible flexibility compared to this

1752
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,480
kind of a direct function calling

1753
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:46,080
approach where it's constrained by the

1754
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,920
list of tools available.

1755
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,920
So this is a kind of general overview of

1756
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,480
our agent. It's actually very simple

1757
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,120
kind of it's not like a very complex

1758
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,800
architecture. Um part of reason we also

1759
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,040
as as I'll also mention later we're

1760
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,800
going to train the models as well. So

1761
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,840
having a simple agent architecture also

1762
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,000
gives the uh the it's much easier uh

1763
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,280
when we do the end to end kind of a

1764
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,600
agent uh as well. So just give an

1765
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:13,920
overview give a task uh give a question

1766
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,159
from the users and you have a retrieve

1767
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,960
from uh the relevant tools and you will

1768
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:20,400
reason about it and then you will code

1769
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,480
uh and then you have an execution result

1770
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,960
and more reasoning and more to use and

1771
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:29,199
so on and until you think okay this is

1772
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:31,760
the answer that can return to the user.

1773
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:33,920
So that's our uh method and then I'll

1774
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,800
delve into a tons of evaluation that we

1775
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:39,760
did uh to show that it's actually have

1776
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:42,320
30 signals. So we first used utilize

1777
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,920
fusion house lab bench. Uh so we use the

1778
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,840
development set from like 45 questions

1779
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,239
from these data sets just to tune the

1780
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,840
agent to just tune the tools and these

1781
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:52,880
are like database queries and sequence

1782
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,560
manipulations as well. And on hold out

1783
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,199
test set we're able to see the biom

1784
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:00,400
achieve human level uh performance on on

1785
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:02,800
on these two specific uh tasks and it

1786
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,600
also outperforms all the baselines

1787
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,840
including RMS react coding agent it's

1788
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:11,440
literature agent coding plus research

1789
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,880
agent and also this is the ablation uh

1790
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:17,280
where we instead of using coding where

1791
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:19,280
we use a tool use and yeah but this is

1792
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,040
kind of a like more like a sanity check

1793
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,920
because we kind of we have the other

1794
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,000
side So here on completely no

1795
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,080
development set benchmarks on humanity

1796
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,480
last exam

1797
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:33,600
our agent is also able to perform uh

1798
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:36,840
pretty well uh on completely zero shot

1799
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,840
uh settings

1800
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,040
but but actually all of these three

1801
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,960
benchmarks are like exam style like

1802
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,600
multiple choice questions. They are not

1803
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,239
like real world research questions. So

1804
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,480
we set out to kind of go ahead and then

1805
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:53,120
create a new class of evals that

1806
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,800
correspond to real world uh research. So

1807
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,040
this include like GW was collagen

1808
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,719
detections. uh for example you have GW

1809
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,040
was hit there's a neighborhood there's

1810
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,480
many genes which one is the color genes

1811
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,239
and then the perturbation screen design

1812
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,719
you want to design a screen you want to

1813
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:10,400
select 50 genes uh for like T- cell for

1814
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:12,560
T- cell exhaustion which gene to select

1815
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,840
and also single science annotations

1816
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:18,159
microbound text analysis repurposing red

1817
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,800
diagnosis and so on and so on this is a

1818
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:23,440
snapshot of uh the thousands of tasks

1819
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,400
out there but it's a a snapshot of the

1820
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:28,400
most some of the popular tasks out there

1821
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,320
and for all these tasks we're able to

1822
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:32,080
get some proxy of the ground truth from

1823
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,000
the users. For example, the collagen

1824
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,840
detection, we have some expert annotated

1825
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,320
deeply. For the perturbation screen

1826
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,400
design, we have uh like for this

1827
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,400
specific cell like context of interest,

1828
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,640
some people have already done the genome

1829
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,239
screen. So, we know whatever 50 genes

1830
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:50,400
you choose, we already know the post

1831
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:52,080
posturb effect. Um and for single sign

1832
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,679
annotation, we have the alter annotation

1833
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,679
as well. So these are all like some

1834
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,760
proxies of the ground shoes and we can

1835
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,000
measure how good is the agent align with

1836
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,080
this kind of proxy and overall we to

1837
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
find out also completely zero shot no

1838
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:07,360
development set our agent is able to

1839
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,440
have best performance for them

1840
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,199
but still we feel like this is still

1841
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,600
also some benchmark with some kind of

1842
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:15,440
proxy of the grues I think we really

1843
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,600
want to give this tool to the scientists

1844
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:21,520
let them try out and then see if it

1845
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:23,840
really uh kind of useful for them so we

1846
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,520
first partnered with a few labs just to

1847
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,560
test it out. So for example, we work

1848
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,840
with Li Tong's lab. So so Li was doing a

1849
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,080
lot of functional genome functional

1850
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,640
screen on like crispers genetic

1851
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:37,040
experiments and so on. So one one of his

1852
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,280
uh students uh was was doing this

1853
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,199
cloning. Um so I have I have a plasma

1854
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,199
sequence here. I have to clone a crisper

1855
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:45,280
guy targeting the human B2 gene into

1856
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:48,960
this plasma. I want to generate a plasma

1857
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:50,880
map and a step-by-step guidance. So

1858
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,360
instead of human do it it give the task

1859
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,480
to the bounty and the bounty just go

1860
01:19:53,360 --> 01:20:00,080
ahead and then do the plasma analysis gi

1861
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:01,679
design or design near and so on so on so

1862
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,040
so on it takes around after eight

1863
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,520
minutes to complete the task

1864
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,480
and then b is able to generate a wellap

1865
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:13,520
coning protocols uh in a very in details

1866
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:17,199
for example the the the olo sequence

1867
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,400
here the primary sequence here and also

1868
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:20,480
each step by

1869
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,600
uh plans and the scientists will

1870
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,679
basically need to just need to follow

1871
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:27,040
the protocols and and then perform the

1872
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:28,400
clone experiments and Jerry there here

1873
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,920
just really perform the experiment

1874
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,960
following the protocol and he's able to

1875
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:35,760
find this successful um and he's happy

1876
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,719
so he you know I mean cloning cloning is

1877
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,960
not like a it's not the the the craziest

1878
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:44,560
noble kind of task but it's like super

1879
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,440
frequent super super kind of a involved

1880
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:48,800
it still takes some time right few hours

1881
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:52,000
and navigating different from different

1882
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:54,480
tools snapping a um to generate one even

1883
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,159
one construct but biomic does it on in

1884
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,920
10 minutes and they just need a natural

1885
01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:00,239
language prompt and just wait there and

1886
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,880
after a coffee you'll just get get a get

1887
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:04,880
the result

1888
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,040
so later we kind of further want to test

1889
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:10,239
it out uh to like a more rigorous

1890
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:13,760
settings so so Jerry here created 10

1891
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:16,480
more tasks that correspond to this like

1892
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:18,880
day-to-day gene editing experiments and

1893
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:22,400
then We recruited a trainee who is a

1894
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:24,480
Stanford master students um and uh she

1895
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,159
has done cloning before and also

1896
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,719
recruited expert who has done who's a

1897
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:30,320
postto in this lab and she has done

1898
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:32,960
cloning for the past eight years like a

1899
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:36,400
real world kind of expert

1900
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:38,880
and we asked I also do the LM and biom

1901
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:41,360
and we for all these four entities we

1902
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,960
asked them to do this 10 tasks and then

1903
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,679
we have another expert just blindly

1904
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:48,000
review all these 10 tasks and rate how

1905
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:50,480
complete is how accurate it is and then

1906
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,040
we're able to find that bomi has pretty

1907
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:55,280
similar grade as the expert and it's

1908
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,040
much much better than trainees of of

1909
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,880
course much much better than LM LM just

1910
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,600
kind of hallucinates all the time for

1911
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,280
the this kind of very granular protocols

1912
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:06,320
so actually this gap is actually really

1913
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:09,040
interesting because the trainee um like

1914
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:10,880
usually training needs to bug the PH

1915
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,480
sing P to get a task done but now

1916
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,960
actually you can just need to talk to

1917
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,440
Bomi has similar performance you know

1918
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,360
biom will never say no to any request.

1919
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,679
Yeah.

1920
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:24,400
So, so that's on the web part and then

1921
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,000
you also we also able to find that uh

1922
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:29,199
the agent is really really useful for

1923
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,719
the dry lab data analysis as well. So

1924
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:33,360
here we partnered with uh micro

1925
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,199
standards lab with MTA um basically they

1926
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,840
have a lot of wearable sensor data like

1927
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:40,080
glucose monitoring activities and uh

1928
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,639
they're like 458 raw style sheets like

1929
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:45,280
super comp like there's a lot of missing

1930
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:47,840
data in there and just a pretty manual

1931
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:51,040
and kind of complex task uh for for

1932
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,639
humans. But the more complex it is

1933
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,880
actually the most suitable is the agent

1934
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:56,960
right because the agent just feed into

1935
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,840
the folders and then it just goes in and

1936
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:02,960
then just iterate over everything. Um so

1937
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:05,199
we give the task to the agent uh it have

1938
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,440
um you know the data set pre-processing

1939
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:09,600
some doing doing all of these steps and

1940
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,080
after 35 minutes it generate tons of

1941
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,920
visualizations and also generates some

1942
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,719
interesting conclusions and

1943
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,600
interestingly uh Ma when she did the

1944
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:21,040
same analysis um she also has a similar

1945
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,639
similar kind of conclusion but the agent

1946
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,560
actually did a much more visualization

1947
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,679
much more explore much more experiments

1948
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:30,159
as well and uh she it took her like

1949
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,000
three weeks and taking working two to

1950
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:34,159
three hours per day to get a task done.

1951
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,520
But the the agent was able to complete

1952
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:39,520
it in approximately 35 minutes.

1953
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:42,000
So we are able to see that on this kind

1954
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,639
of manual complex data analysis agent is

1955
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,880
tremendously helpful.

1956
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,880
But actually for this example uh it's

1957
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,639
all like Excel sheets. So all this kind

1958
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,960
of uh um uh like uh it it does not

1959
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:57,520
require like specialist software

1960
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,520
packages to do this unprocessing. So

1961
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,600
here we are actually also demonstrated

1962
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,159
with a more complex example on this

1963
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:07,360
single single taxi data set this multiom

1964
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:10,400
data set where it involves very complex

1965
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:13,679
softwares and and a choice of databases

1966
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:16,080
and and kind of the steps. So hung here

1967
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:19,280
uh was want wanted to an analyze this

1968
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:21,360
multiomx data sets and then uh it gives

1969
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,719
some kind of detail instructions and the

1970
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,679
agent just be able to follow the

1971
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:27,440
instruction use pyynic uh jung boost

1972
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,880
this target and so on so on and after a

1973
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,600
few hours it generate all the

1974
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,520
visualizations and also generate um kind

1975
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:37,600
of some interesting findings as well. So

1976
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:40,159
here is the this no TFS um that show

1977
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,719
hierarchic activities across the scatter

1978
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:46,320
lineages which is is not reported in the

1979
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:48,960
original author's papers and also the GT

1980
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,360
and Pierre who who are the biologists

1981
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,800
also manually check the traces and and

1982
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:55,600
find out they actually align with how

1983
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,600
they also perform the task as well.

1984
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,120
So cool. So these are some like quick

1985
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,840
case studies that we demonstrate in

1986
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:03,520
paper and since our the launch of Bomni

1987
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,480
we also increasingly realized that you

1988
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,480
know we want to basically create an

1989
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,639
operating system of B research that just

1990
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,719
can defragment all these database

1991
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:14,560
software tools and putting them into the

1992
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:15,840
same roof. Um and uh we we make the the

1993
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,400
open source package like really really

1994
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,320
easy to integrate this new integrations

1995
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,719
and uh we also realize that every new

1996
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:25,360
integration enables new task

1997
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:27,120
capabilities in a compounding way right

1998
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:30,000
because you add a new tool but this tool

1999
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,760
can be used by multiple tasks and then I

2000
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,040
keep adding this tool you're unlocking

2001
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,040
more and more kind of a capabilities.

2002
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,760
So here just want to demonstrate a few

2003
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,440
of these examples. So we partner with

2004
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,760
Siverse uh who kind of host a various

2005
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,760
list of softwares in for single cell

2006
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,760
spatial and perturbation data analysis

2007
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:54,719
such as porti scampy um and and like svi

2008
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,880
and things like that. So here uh after

2009
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:59,120
equipping adding the software to the

2010
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,040
bioni uh it's able to do like spatial

2011
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,800
data analysis for example. So here we

2012
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:05,280
give an example like given a sick fish

2013
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,760
data set uh we ask it to explore it

2014
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,440
freely and analyze it and identify

2015
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,199
interesting structures and generate some

2016
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:14,560
hypothesis

2017
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:17,760
it so it made a plan and then after like

2018
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:20,000
a few like a few hours I to generate a

2019
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,000
few interesting hypothesis and well also

2020
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,080
with the post experiments and the

2021
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,760
expected outcome as well.

2022
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,280
So, so that's on the single side

2023
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,000
analysis and then we also partnered with

2024
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:35,040
Tamar Bio who's like a API writers for

2025
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,159
this protein design models. Um, so here

2026
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:40,480
we can now do ping design uh with biom u

2027
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:42,080
for example g studing porting sequence

2028
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:44,560
you want to iteratively optimize it

2029
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:47,679
thermal stability. The biom basically

2030
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:49,920
given a sequence it it make the make a

2031
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,600
plan to use alpha fold to make a

2032
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,679
prediction on the protein sequence and

2033
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,920
it use another model thermal mpn to

2034
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,679
predict the thermal stabilities and then

2035
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,679
it look at different databases

2036
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,920
literature'ses and also look at the

2037
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:04,080
predictions and the the structure itself

2038
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,920
and propose the mutations to modify the

2039
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:08,159
protein sequence to optimize the thermal

2040
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,320
stabilities and it's it and it does it

2041
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:13,280
in like several rounds until it kind of

2042
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:15,760
improve on the on the thermal stability

2043
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:17,920
And so here's the the answer like all

2044
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:20,239
autonomously it's like this is the

2045
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,639
optimized sequence and this is the in

2046
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:24,560
each cycle what is the mutation close

2047
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:27,679
and this is also the rational right here

2048
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:30,239
this at the early early 80 uh 80 third

2049
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,639
positions the transfer from like Q

2050
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:35,280
mutated to I and the reason is like it

2051
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:38,239
has enhanced hydrophobic co-acking and

2052
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:40,880
so on so and it's also able to see that

2053
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:43,280
the the thermal stability also just uh

2054
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,840
uh kind of increases um as the cycle

2055
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:47,840
goes by

2056
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:51,040
and u and also we partner with pallet

2057
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:54,080
robot which is like a u like a python

2058
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:56,639
interface um for all kinds of different

2059
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,560
web lab equipments like Hamilton open

2060
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,719
and so on because we think in the future

2061
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,560
if you really want to build a biologist

2062
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:04,239
that can just automate everything like

2063
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,400
from data analysis all the way to well

2064
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:08,719
experiment all the way just to give you

2065
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,880
something um you know like a very long

2066
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:13,360
horizon fashion the web part is

2067
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:15,280
definitely a bigger a big bottleneck uh

2068
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:17,679
and I think it's still very early right

2069
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,920
now but we partnering with pilot robot

2070
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,920
to demonstrate some early capabilities

2071
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,080
um so for example right now you can just

2072
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,159
use natural language queries to uh

2073
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,880
orchestrate like liquid handlers or some

2074
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:31,040
other robotics as well here is a is a

2075
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,960
demo so this is really bly in action you

2076
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:35,840
just put it in a natural language query

2077
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:39,199
um and it's able to basically move move

2078
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,880
kind of plates from plates um in the

2079
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:43,679
future as pal robot is kind of expanding

2080
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:46,159
to more and more robotics covering kind

2081
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,840
of more operations where where we're

2082
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:49,440
we're kind of thinking like you know in

2083
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:52,080
the future it's like another agent

2084
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:54,400
create a prompt uh for the pan robot to

2085
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:56,400
do it and then will also return the

2086
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,960
result and then it will inform it to do

2087
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:02,639
the next step and it just continues um

2088
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:04,639
until it has the answers.

2089
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:08,000
Yeah, as you can see it it successfully

2090
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:09,600
move from wheel to world.

2091
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,920
Cool. So these are also just kind of

2092
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,920
some demonstration because we we it's a

2093
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:17,040
general purpose agent. We can do all

2094
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,600
kinds of different u capabilities. So

2095
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,960
we're able to try a few things out like

2096
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,520
for example you can do varying

2097
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,760
interpretations for human analysis and

2098
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,520
we can do automatic profiling for J

2099
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,360
developers and we could also do some

2100
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,880
like manual task like download some

2101
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:34,080
random data sets online which actually

2102
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:36,320
takes some time as well. Um and then

2103
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,920
also do like screen designs as I

2104
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:40,560
mentioned also do some real data

2105
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,400
diagnosis because often it involves more

2106
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,239
than justification phenotypes but also

2107
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:46,800
you give like the VCF files then you

2108
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:49,280
will need to uh basically run some

2109
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,080
binformatics pipelines and use reasoning

2110
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:54,560
ability to integrate it with some the

2111
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:58,800
phenotypes and then create a diagnosis

2112
01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:01,600
and also dockings annotation and so on.

2113
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,760
Yeah. So we open source biom uh you know

2114
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,600
to public and uh since then I think a

2115
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,560
lot of people are contributing uh new

2116
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:11,280
tool data set and softwares as well. Um

2117
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:13,679
and also we also add like MCP support so

2118
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,159
we can expose it to to the I don't know

2119
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:18,960
like other uh like cloud code and things

2120
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:21,199
like that as well.

2121
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,199
So we also build a web platform that for

2122
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:25,040
scientists that can quickly just give a

2123
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:27,360
natural language query and it'll get the

2124
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:29,440
task done. Um so here this is the

2125
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,600
platform uh interface. So I'm just

2126
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:33,840
giving you an example here. Here for

2127
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,920
example this is a s the the the spatial

2128
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,800
data analysis example here initially it

2129
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:41,360
makes the plan um and then you write a

2130
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,920
lot of code and then this code will be

2131
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:45,920
automatically run in a sandbox with the

2132
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:49,199
result and then you will just keep doing

2133
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:52,159
it and um yeah just going through all

2134
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:53,600
this iterations and uh it generates some

2135
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:56,159
visualization as well like the

2136
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:58,159
spatializations

2137
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:00,080
um yeah and then you will once it gets

2138
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:02,480
it done you will also like black the

2139
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:04,880
step is and then just continue the next

2140
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,960
step and then continue until all the

2141
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,639
steps in the plan are finished and you

2142
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,280
will return to the user with the final

2143
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:14,679
report. Um yeah that you can immediately

2144
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,679
use as well.

2145
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,600
Cool. Yeah and it's available right now

2146
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:22,400
at biom standard review. Feel free to

2147
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,000
try that out as well.

2148
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,600
And I think since we launched it we also

2149
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,920
able to amazingly find out a lot of try

2150
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,920
to scare people like real world like

2151
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,000
moving beyond academia right this so

2152
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,920
this is a number of user in the first 80

2153
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,320
days. also able to amazingly find all

2154
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,400
these pharma scientists actually using

2155
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:41,600
it across different use cases ranging

2156
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:43,280
from target discovery um like add meta

2157
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:47,360
property predictions and all the way

2158
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:50,000
even to the clinical side of things

2159
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:51,679
cool so I think that's the you know was

2160
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,840
the the first project first phase of

2161
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:56,560
bing project so what's next I'll share

2162
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:58,960
some more recent works on um the things

2163
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,440
that are we are very excited about uh so

2164
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,199
I think it briefly kind of a it

2165
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,800
generally falls into two two categories.

2166
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:06,480
The first one is want to achieve expert

2167
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,080
level performance and the second one is

2168
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,000
this kind of a when we have the

2169
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,520
generalist biometical agent the

2170
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,520
foundation layer then we can start

2171
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,760
building the agenic system to compose

2172
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:18,000
them and to get more even more kind of

2173
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,560
new capabilities. Um so here I will

2174
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,679
demonstrate hypos validation and also to

2175
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:25,520
develop some biology new algorithms as

2176
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:28,000
well.

2177
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,560
Um so the first task is uh how do we

2178
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,719
achieve actual level performance because

2179
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,560
biom can get a get a task done and give

2180
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:38,080
you a report no matter what task you

2181
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,679
give. But it's also yeah we able to see

2182
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:42,400
that for many tasks it's able to give

2183
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:44,639
like expert level performance but for

2184
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:48,000
also a long tail of many many tasks it's

2185
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:50,320
not there yet. Um so how do we improve

2186
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,679
the agent in a systematic way to achieve

2187
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,920
accessible level performance for any

2188
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:56,080
tasks? That's kind of the a very

2189
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,440
important problems. Um and I was

2190
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,880
thinking if there's a scalable way to do

2191
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,480
it as well. So as Helen mentioned like

2192
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,840
reinforcement learning recently has got

2193
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,560
a lot a lot of attention because it's

2194
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,960
it's a extremely scalable way. Uh you

2195
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,199
just define the data the reward and you

2196
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:12,239
just train agent uh just it will figure

2197
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:15,120
out on its own uh like he climb uh on

2198
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:17,520
its own. Right? So this a so this this

2199
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,960
the idea is very appealing also for bio

2200
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,600
medicine as well because we can collect

2201
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,320
a lot of b data with some reward and

2202
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:26,480
then you train uh end to end and then

2203
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:28,560
just improve it.

2204
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:31,679
Naturally the I is also I think very

2205
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,199
interestingly how uh is a kind of enable

2206
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,600
potentially a new way of doing things

2207
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:37,840
right because if you think about how how

2208
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,920
our current way of doing things is also

2209
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,760
scientists follow some like a protocol

2210
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,840
some convention like se sequence of

2211
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,760
steps and this convention was also

2212
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,679
generated through this trials and errors

2213
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,520
by a group of researcher maybe like 10

2214
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:52,000
years ago

2215
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,760
but it's not necessarily the optimal way

2216
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,080
uh because it could be there's optim

2217
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,000
more optimal sequence of steps to do it

2218
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:00,080
And I think the IO is a very nice way

2219
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,159
because basically ask it to do massive

2220
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,840
number of trials and errors and then

2221
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:06,000
given a reward it's able to see okay

2222
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,800
this actually this path is actually more

2223
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,239
optimal and then maybe it's a more than

2224
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,800
it could be a way to learn this kind of

2225
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:16,000
a superhuman level convention a new way

2226
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,840
of doing the same task.

2227
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,520
So we're inspired by that and we built

2228
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:22,719
the first version of it uh which is

2229
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,080
called army R0 uh because it's it's we

2230
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,360
think there's so much things to add on.

2231
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:29,199
So that's why we call it R0 instead of

2232
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:33,040
R1. Um but basic basic idea is like we

2233
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:34,400
still use our environment the E1 and

2234
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,679
also the A1 which is the agent

2235
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:37,760
architecture. It's like a very simple

2236
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:40,159
agent architecture and then we do like

2237
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,320
trajectory like roll out. So you collect

2238
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:45,199
a bunch of trajectory with the answer

2239
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:48,560
from the agent and for we define 10

2240
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:50,719
tasks with a predefined reward and you

2241
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:53,199
can let the OM know okay for for this

2242
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:54,320
kind of trajectory you you're doing

2243
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:57,120
really well and for this kind of

2244
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:58,960
trajectory it's not and then the

2245
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:00,320
during the back propagation is able to

2246
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,000
automatically figure out what kind of

2247
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:05,040
steps is important what kind of step is

2248
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,679
not and then by aggregation it's able to

2249
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:10,320
generate a new trajectory that is that

2250
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:12,880
is kind of a optimized the the reward.

2251
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:16,080
So this joint work done with led by Ryan

2252
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:19,280
and also collaboration with she ga Yuri

2253
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:21,199
and also with the sky group at Berkeley

2254
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,639
and uh for some initial results we're

2255
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:24,239
able to see that even use some open

2256
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,800
source models like a billion queen

2257
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:30,159
models after training it's able to get

2258
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:32,639
really good performance on in domain uh

2259
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:35,760
tasks for example here we are able to

2260
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:37,280
have 85% improvement and actually the

2261
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:41,199
performance is actually on par with the

2262
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,719
clos models as well and If we use a 32

2263
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:45,440
billion model, it's actually even able

2264
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,760
to outperform this closed source models

2265
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,000
and uh because the performance is so

2266
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:51,600
sign so significant we're thinking this

2267
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,800
is a potentially a very interesting

2268
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:58,400
recipe to um kind of do the here climb

2269
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:59,679
and achieve expert level performance

2270
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,280
and we're also able to find that

2271
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,480
improvement is also very consistent

2272
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:06,800
across different subtasks. So here this

2273
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:09,840
is the list of 10 tasks we are using um

2274
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:12,719
for now crisper crisper delivery G was

2275
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,800
color gene g paralizations and also

2276
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,400
patient patient gene detection is also

2277
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,800
like design the screen and things like

2278
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:21,679
that and you can see that actually this

2279
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,199
agent I think in this 10 task [snorts] I

2280
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,520
think our agent is has the best

2281
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:28,239
performance in like seven to eight uh

2282
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,159
task as well so it's also very

2283
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:31,760
consistent

2284
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:33,440
yeah so I think after that we're also

2285
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,520
thinking a lot about you know is this is

2286
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,639
really the way to go. Uh we're still

2287
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,159
thinking about it. So we'll be also

2288
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:41,040
curious to hear your thoughts as well.

2289
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:42,320
Um but if you we really look at like

2290
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:45,119
first of all is it like similar to

2291
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:46,800
humans? um because for IIO it actually

2292
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:48,880
require hund hundreds of examples for

2293
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,520
same task for the trials and errors as

2294
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:53,920
well but to throw out but for real world

2295
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:55,920
biologist they they don't have the

2296
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:58,159
privilege to do hundreds of trials right

2297
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:01,600
because it's so expensive to run uh on

2298
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:03,760
one task and they just need a few uh and

2299
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,600
also the biology domain like I think the

2300
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:07,600
hard one of the hardest challenge that

2301
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,880
we face when we do the R0 project

2302
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:13,040
actually the reward function is very uh

2303
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:16,719
hard to define uh there's many the task

2304
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:18,480
there just no reward. Um so because of

2305
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:21,040
because it just biology is intrinsically

2306
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:23,520
low data right so how do you um kind of

2307
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:25,119
define rewards uh in this setting in a

2308
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,280
large scale fashion it's also a bit

2309
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:29,119
unclear and recently I think there's

2310
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:31,199
also lots of lots of discussion around

2311
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:35,040
this idea around system prompt learning

2312
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:37,840
where um you just try it once and then

2313
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:39,360
you have another LM to reason okay what

2314
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,520
kind of lessons did you learn then put

2315
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:43,600
the lessons into the prompt as kind of

2316
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,199
in the memory or something like that so

2317
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,560
we also exploring all these kind of

2318
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:50,400
ideas trying to uh achieve expert level

2319
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,360
performance in a in a more kind of data

2320
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,417
efficient fashion.

2321
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,800
So so that's the first category of

2322
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:59,520
[snorts] task we're we're looking at

2323
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,360
right now and another task is also

2324
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:05,119
another category is like this multi-

2325
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:07,840
aenting systems. So uh as as ham briefly

2326
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:10,159
mentioned um I think getting a task done

2327
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,639
is just one component of this more

2328
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:14,080
global hypothesis validation. So

2329
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,760
typically given hypothesis there's

2330
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,199
usually multiple different kind of

2331
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:20,320
falsification experiment that you want

2332
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:23,119
to do to really forify a hypothesis. So

2333
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:25,520
here uh in working with uh Ying Ryan

2334
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:28,159
Michael and Emanuel and Yuri we proposed

2335
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,800
a new method that actually was based on

2336
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:33,199
biom agent uh that interle multiple of

2337
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,760
them and then to have a more rigorous

2338
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:38,320
approach to do hypo validations. I think

2339
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,560
the idea is like we have one agent which

2340
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:43,199
is called the experiment design agent

2341
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,920
given the hypothesis it will basically

2342
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:47,760
we ask it do some iterations to design a

2343
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:49,440
falsification experiment to falsify the

2344
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:53,280
main hypothesis

2345
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:55,119
uh and then after um it is done we'll

2346
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:58,639
have a experiment execution agent which

2347
01:38:55,119 --> 01:39:00,639
is based on biom omni to execute it for

2348
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:03,119
example like writing a lot of code uh

2349
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:06,719
observe it and the result and then just

2350
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:09,440
continue and generate a p val

2351
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:11,600
and then because usually for a main

2352
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,960
biology hypothesis there's often usually

2353
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,880
all kinds of different subcation

2354
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,480
experiments we need some way to

2355
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,840
aggregate it in a rigorous fashion to

2356
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,760
have some kind of sequential error

2357
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:22,000
control this relates to the E values

2358
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,600
that Helen mentioned u to give like more

2359
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,080
rigorous error control in a sequential

2360
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:28,239
fashion and so overall we're able to

2361
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:30,719
this genic system able to kind of

2362
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:32,800
control the force discovery rate sorry

2363
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:35,600
control type one error rate and still

2364
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:38,239
improve power by a

2365
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:41,119
So we test it out in the real world. We

2366
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:43,360
recruit like 10 PhD level uh scientists

2367
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:46,560
and then give them the same level a same

2368
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:47,920
kind of hypothesis to validate. So they

2369
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,719
uh and we able to find that they have

2370
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:53,520
similar type rate similar power as well

2371
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:56,480
and also it takes much much shorter for

2372
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,639
uh but takes and and it generates much

2373
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,960
more experiment write more code uh than

2374
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:02,960
humans but interestingly it's able to

2375
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,639
also find kind of a they're doing pretty

2376
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,159
similar things right they're designing

2377
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,560
similar kinds of falsification

2378
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:11,280
experiments like testing the expression

2379
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:13,040
correlation from G from GTA interaction

2380
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,800
network from some physical physical from

2381
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:17,440
protein point interaction networks

2382
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:19,199
EQTL data sets um and there's also

2383
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,159
proposed some new ones and human have

2384
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:24,080
some new ones as well and also they're

2385
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:26,880
using all kinds of different diverse

2386
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:28,960
statistical tests as well.

2387
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,960
So we're able to say like by composing

2388
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:34,560
this agent together we're able to do

2389
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:36,560
like more high level uh tasks uh that

2390
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,880
enable like new capabilities for for

2391
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,719
scientists

2392
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,040
and uh and lastly I also want to

2393
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:45,600
highlight a new work that's in

2394
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:49,760
collaboration which is led by Alistister

2395
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:52,480
uh working with Li and Martin here uh is

2396
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:55,440
basically using agent to also develop

2397
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:57,600
our algorithm. So actually the first few

2398
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:59,760
years of my PhD before the agent stuff I

2399
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,840
was also just developing this AI bio

2400
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:04,960
models like just on the biological data

2401
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:07,520
sets and I often find that it often the

2402
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,199
best model is often involves uh

2403
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,280
embedding this kind of biological

2404
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:13,440
inductive bias right into the model. So

2405
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,199
you you need to know both AI and biology

2406
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:17,679
deeply in order to create like a

2407
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:20,480
customized models like alpha flow. Alpha

2408
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:22,480
is a great example like embeds all this

2409
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:24,159
kind of prior knowledges the deep

2410
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,400
knowledge about the data and trans and

2411
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:28,960
convert it into the modules in the AI

2412
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,560
models and make it really work. So we

2413
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,119
think the AI agent is actually maybe the

2414
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:35,040
for the first time the maybe the best

2415
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:37,600
single entity that knows both AI and

2416
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:39,840
biology so deeply. So it can potentially

2417
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:43,840
de develop much much better AI plus biom

2418
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:46,159
models. Uh uh yeah. So here we we

2419
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,719
created the first uh versions of it uh

2420
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:51,440
like a like a initial attempt which the

2421
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:54,560
basic idea is like given a task. You

2422
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:56,880
have some uh kind of the uh validation

2423
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,480
set as well and then you ask the agent

2424
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,960
to collect all these domain knowledges

2425
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:03,119
and then create propose some solutions

2426
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,280
and then start iterating on on on this

2427
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:07,679
on these solutions and for this during

2428
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:10,239
the iteration for each step you will

2429
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,080
have the validation set performance and

2430
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:13,679
also from the literature we also gather

2431
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:17,360
a lot of instructions on how do you

2432
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:19,360
update uh uh these solutions and there's

2433
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,880
a lot of details as well but overall

2434
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,360
that's the idea. So you can iteratively

2435
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,600
just optimize this algorithm in order to

2436
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:29,199
beat and in order to have like great

2437
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:31,760
validation set performance as well.

2438
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:34,880
So in the in the paper there's much more

2439
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:37,119
in-depth benchmarks. Uh but I think

2440
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:39,440
really interestingly we kind of at least

2441
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:42,159
they really apply it to human genetics

2442
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:45,600
tasks. For example this is SDIS which

2443
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:48,880
was opposed by Martin uh while he was

2444
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,960
actually had here. Um so it's like a

2445
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:54,000
disease critical cell population cell

2446
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:56,000
type uh detection algorithms that has

2447
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,639
like kind of forces control but I need

2448
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,679
to detect as much disease critical cell

2449
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:04,000
types as possible. So the so the tus AI

2450
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:06,080
just takes in the original SDIS and then

2451
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
just start optimizing it. So also not

2452
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:10,000
notably the T AI can do both auto

2453
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,920
optimization from existing algorithms

2454
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
also just can completely generate from

2455
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,400
scratch as well. But for this example,

2456
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,280
it's basically generating from some uh

2457
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:21,920
base checkpoints. But it's able to have

2458
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:24,880
like much much better power like 40%

2459
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,960
more power. And then it's able to also

2460
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:30,080
have kind of same level of force

2461
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:32,800
discovery rate control as well. And then

2462
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:35,520
it's also able to detect like no cell

2463
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:37,280
types that match with truth and also

2464
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,840
detect no cell type when you when we

2465
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:42,400
apply it to some autoimmune diseases.

2466
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,960
And interestingly uh it takes 24 hours

2467
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:47,840
and the agent tried like 136 versions

2468
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,760
and at a cost of 30 cents. Uh but the

2469
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,000
original author take like 10 try 10

2470
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:54,719
versions of it over three months uh to

2471
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,480
get it done. So we're we're really

2472
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,000
thinking in the future maybe the next

2473
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,600
generation of AI plus bio models

2474
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,760
actually generated by agent. So we need

2475
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:05,840
to actually train the agent to how do we

2476
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:07,840
generate uh these AI plus biom models.

2477
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,280
Cool. So I guess uh that's all for my

2478
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:11,280
talk. Thank you. I want to talk my thank

2479
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:14,679
my co-author again and uh this is also

2480
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,679
my contact information.
