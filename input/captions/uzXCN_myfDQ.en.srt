1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,780
- Hi, everyone. Thank you
all for joining today.

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,400
For today's seminar,

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,900
we have Professor Masha
Kamenetska from BU.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,790
She's an assistant professor joint

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,610
in the Departments of
Chemistry and Physics.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,220
She's also a member of material
science and engineering,

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,910
as well as the Nanotechnology
Innovation Center.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,920
Broadly speaking, her research focuses

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,460
on single molecule spectroscopy
and characterization,

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,270
and her work has been
recognized by awards,

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,600
including the Air Force
Young Investigator Award

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,883
as well as the NSF CAREER Award.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,180
So it's a pleasure to have
you, Masha, here with us today,

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,600
and we're going to learn
more about Masha's work

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,070
on engineering quantum properties

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,710
of molecular circuits with chemistry.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,250
So before I ask Masha to join me here,

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,590
just as a reminder, if you
have any questions in the room,

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,020
feel free to raise your hand
to ask your question directly.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,000
For those who are listening to us online,

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,090
if you type your question
through the Q&A option,

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,630
I'll read it and can help
moderate the questions for you.

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,330
And yeah, Masha, the floor is yours.

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,690
- Thanks.

25
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,320
(audience applauding)

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,520
So thanks so much, Farnaz,
for organizing this visit.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,050
I've really enjoyed my day.

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,970
Thank you all who have met with me.

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,473
I've learned a lot.

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,900
As some of you know,

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,430
I did do my undergraduate
degree here at MIT,

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,770
so it's a little bit
surreal to be back here

33
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,050
in this kind of different capacity.

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,910
What's more is,

35
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,950
so I was a Course 8 major,

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,260
so that's physics for
those of you (chuckles)

37
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,120
who, like me, might've forgotten.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,680
And now as you'll see,

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,780
a lot of what I do is molecular in nature.

40
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,133
So we'll see how well I
do here switching fields.

41
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,890
So, you know, as, as Farnaz said,

42
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,020
my work is interdisciplinary

43
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,320
and my lab broadly focuses on developing

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,600
and then applying single-molecule tools

45
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,610
to probe matter on the nanoscale

46
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,560
on the single-molecule level.

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,270
Today I'll focus mostly on
these molecular metal junctions,

48
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,470
molecule metal junctions

49
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,100
where we can create circuits
out of single molecules.

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
So before I jump into that,

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,760
I just want to give you a broad overview

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,620
of a little bit of what my lab does.

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,000
As I said, we focus broadly
on probing single molecules,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,660
and so that spans kind
of the nanoscale range

55
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,510
or regime where we have
small molecules bound

56
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,250
to metal electrodes,

57
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,160
but we're also working

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,610
on biophysical systems
using a different class

59
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,300
of techniques called optical
tweezers to probe kinetics

60
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,790
and thermodynamics of
biological materials.

61
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,260
And then here in between,

62
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,680
we're working to apply these
tools borrowed from biophysics

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,220
to more material science applications.

64
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,760
And I see Haneel there
in the back who's working

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,800
on this problem in my lab.

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Okay, so that's kind of a
broad overview, and again,

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,850
before I jump into the specifics,

68
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,380
I think it's good for us all to get

69
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,590
on the same kind of page in terms of,

70
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,610
you know, the motivation.

71
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,740
So why go through the trouble

72
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,020
of isolating a single molecule

73
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,330
so that we can watch it in real time?

74
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,020
Well, it's because, you
know, molecules are dynamic.

75
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,750
So I think biophysics
community was the first

76
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,570
to kind of really articulate
this very clearly.

77
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,570
If you imagine some sort
of biological complex such

78
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,930
as this kind of monster over here,

79
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,020
you might realize that a lot
of the functionality here comes

80
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,780
from the interface
between different elements

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,613
of this complex.

82
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:47,040
So there's intramolecular
interactions between, you know,

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,960
different parts of the same molecule.

84
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,880
There's intermolecular interactions

85
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,320
between different molecules.

86
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,030
And so this complex is dynamic

87
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,280
and these interfaces
are constantly changing

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,430
and it's very hard to
synchronize a large number

89
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,280
of these complexes such
that they're all in phase.

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,020
And so if you put a large
number of them into a test tube

91
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,230
and probe it with some
kind of spectroscopy,

92
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,570
you're going to get a mess, right?

93
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,390
A blur because they're all slightly

94
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,310
in a different phase of their motion.

95
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,590
And so if you can grab a single molecule

96
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,480
and actually watch its dynamics,

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,360
you can really get an
understanding what is the function

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,940
and how does the structure
affect the function

99
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,800
and what are the dynamics?

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,350
I would argue the same set of, you know,

101
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,080
arguments apply to these
molecular junctions,

102
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,270
which are the subject of my talk today,

103
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,000
where you're putting together

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,100
at least two very different components

105
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,740
to make some sort of, you know,

106
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,630
functional device, if you will.

107
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,950
These are not yet devices.

108
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,620
They're still in basic research
phase of their development,

109
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,140
but they have some sort of functionality.

110
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,900
And this was actually
proposed by Aviram and Ratner

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,700
in this seminal paper in the 70s.

112
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,340
And what they really kind of focused on

113
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,710
and proposed in a revolutionary way

114
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,230
is that you can actually design molecules

115
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,240
to give you electronic functionality,

116
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,100
like they can act like, you know,

117
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,500
transistors or diodes, and so on.

118
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,450
But what I think was underappreciated

119
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,510
for many years is the fact
that the interface here,

120
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,910
which, by the way is
a significant fraction

121
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,450
of the overall size of the
system, can't be ignored,

122
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,060
because the interface

123
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,410
is on the same length scale

124
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,460
as the system itself and so
you can't just neglect it.

125
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,960
The dynamics of this interface

126
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
will influence the properties.

127
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
And so you really wanna be able
to isolate this and study it

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,790
and see how changing structures affect

129
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,000
the electronic properties
of the entire circuit.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
What makes these systems really

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,060
unique opportunity, I think,

132
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,240
is that you can see quantum effects

133
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,010
even at room temperature.

134
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,480
Why is, and that's really kind of

135
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,940
what I will be focusing
on today, so why is that?

136
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,250
Well, at the nanometer scale,

137
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,170
if you think about the mean free path

138
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,090
of an electron in a metal,

139
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,920
it's a lot longer than a nanometer.

140
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,090
So what does that mean?

141
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,460
That means that on the
scale of the junction,

142
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,190
the electron crosses the
junction ballistically

143
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,470
without scattering off of phonons.

144
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,620
And so because there's no
scattering on this length scale,

145
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,780
the process, this transport of an electron

146
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,850
across the junction is coherent.

147
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,130
Oops. There's the arrow.

148
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,850
And so even at room temperature,
this coherence is preserved

149
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,520
and we can observe quantum phenomena,

150
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,760
like quantum interference
and then also use chemistry

151
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,620
by manipulating, synthetically,

152
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,390
the structure of this molecule

153
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,960
to control and engineer quantum phenomena.

154
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,330
Okay, so just another

155
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,990
kind of background slide.

156
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,810
So how do we actually
make these measurements?

157
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,670
So for the molecular junctions,

158
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,560
I just mentioned a few minutes ago,

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,170
we use a kind of a
scanning probe technique

160
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,140
where we isolate a molecule
between a tip and a substrate.

161
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,330
And then for, so let me show you,

162
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,410
here's a typical molecule that
we can measure, for example.

163
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,080
For longer molecules and softer materials,

164
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,877
we actually use the optical tweezer,

165
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:12,210
and these two tools are
really kind of complimentary

166
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,900
in that they cover, they span
different regimes of length

167
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,550
and also of energy.

168
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,290
So the scanning probe technique

169
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,560
is really ideal for small
molecules on the nano scale,

170
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,170
because it has exquisite length resolution

171
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,570
and it is quite a stiff probe,

172
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,240
which is compatible with
the covalent linkages

173
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,980
in these short molecules.

174
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,830
In contrast, if you wanna study, you know,

175
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,880
Van der Waals-bonded

176
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,090
or hydrogen-bonded softer materials,

177
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,880
you need a softer probe
on the piconewton scale.

178
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,470
This is also the scale that's ideal

179
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,840
for probing biological complexes.

180
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,810
And you can sacrifice a little
bit of your length resolution

181
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,820
because these are extended systems.

182
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,850
So these are really two nice
complimentary approaches

183
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,380
and we use them both in the lab.

184
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,300
And what I won't get to tell you today

185
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,550
is about our work on biological polymers,

186
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,790
so here's a unzipping
of a single DNA hairpin,

187
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,050
which is kind of cool to see.

188
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,830
Here's the unzipping event
at 10 piconewtons or so.

189
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,850
And the other story that I
won't get to show you today is,

190
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,130
and I learned this previously,

191
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,730
when I have this pointer, I
can't actually play the movies.

192
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,740
So if I could, what this movie would show

193
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,750
is that these are two gold nanoparticles

194
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,360
that we're holding in an
optical tweezer in solution

195
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,030
and we can move them
relative to each other while

196
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,820
at the same time measuring
the plasmonic response.

197
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,540
So that's another project in my lab

198
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,550
that I won't get to
talk to you about today.

199
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,090
Okay, so as I already mentioned,

200
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,940
what I will tell you about
are these molecular junctions

201
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,260
and how we can observe

202
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,470
and control quantum
phenomena in these systems.

203
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,870
So one of the very few

204
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,450
kind of background
theory slides I promised,

205
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,720
but, so I already mentioned
that transport here

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,680
is ballistic, so this is not
like in a macroscopic system

207
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,630
where electron gas diffuses.

208
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,870
That's kind of the model
of conductivity here,

209
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,817
the electron crosses ballistically,

210
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:08,250
and that means that
transport here is described

211
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,210
by the Landauer-Buttiker
model where conductance,

212
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,360
this G's conductance,
current divided by voltage,

213
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,830
so the inverse of what you're used

214
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,110
to reading about resistance,

215
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,390
that's just the convention in this field.

216
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,770
Conductance is going to
depend on the transmission T

217
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,190
of the available quantum
channels in your junction.

218
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,050
So if there are many quantum channels,

219
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,490
then you sum over them,

220
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,740
and you sum over this coefficient T,

221
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,167
the transmittance of this junction.

222
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,840
And so if you have a
single conducting channel

223
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,630
with a transmission probability of 100%,

224
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,510
then you expect a conductance of one G0,

225
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,780
which is the quantum of
conductance through this junction.

226
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,570
So it turns out that
molecules typically have

227
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,070
a transmission probability

228
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,470
that's lower than 100%.

229
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,580
And why is that?

230
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,330
Well, if we kind of do the
kind of the most simple model

231
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,130
of what this system is, we
have two metal electrodes,

232
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,690
which have a continuum of
energy states filled up

233
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,160
to this energy E fermi,

234
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,100
so all my carriers of charge are

235
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,320
at the energy called E fermi.

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,830
Of course we apply a slide bias
which is greatly exaggerated

237
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,860
in this cartoon to drive the
system out of equilibrium

238
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,320
and drive electrons across this junction,

239
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,990
but now as this electron
comes to this junction,

240
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,310
what it sees actually

241
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,520
are these discrete molecular
orbitals from the molecule.

242
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,380
The molecule's like a zero-D system,

243
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,370
so it has these discreet spectrum.

244
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,220
And so these orbitals
are typically mismatched

245
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,130
in energy from the fermi energy of gold

246
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,110
and so what you really have here is kind

247
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,850
of your classic tunneling problem,

248
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,130
which maybe you remember
from back, you know,

249
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,950
introductory quantum classes
where the electron's going

250
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,110
to tunnel across this barrier.

251
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,460
And so the tunneling
probability is exponentially,

252
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,130
decays exponentially with
the length of the molecule.

253
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,960
The longer the barrier,

254
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,120
the lower the transmission probability.

255
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,830
And the other thing that it depends on

256
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,780
is the height of the barrier.

257
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,620
And in this case,

258
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,710
the height of the barrier
is the energy mismatch

259
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,300
between the molecular orbital,

260
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,270
so I should mention, I'm
using chemistry language here.

261
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,670
So MO is molecular orbital.

262
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,460
These are just eigenstates
of the molecular system.

263
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,760
And then the LUMO is the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital

264
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,340
and this is HOMO, highest
occupied molecular orbital.

265
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,620
This is just chemistry jargon,

266
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,550
but the mismatch is what dictates
the height of the barrier

267
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,360
and so your conductance will decay faster

268
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,503
for molecules that have a wider
HOMO-LUMO gap, for example.

269
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,520
So that's one way to think about this.

270
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,660
There's kind of another way

271
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,060
to think about transmission in the system

272
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,500
and that's by realizing that
these discreet resonances

273
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,810
will broaden when the molecule interacts

274
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,643
with the metal, right?

275
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:01,890
So the molecular orbitals
will hybridize with the metal

276
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,440
and so the lifetime will shorten

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,820
and so these resonances will
broaden and it's the broadening

278
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,860
and the resulting overlap of this resonant

279
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,500
of this kind of molecular
orbital resonance,

280
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,190
the orbital overlap at fermi
will dictate transmission.

281
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,650
So energy level alignment is important

282
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,270
and broadening is also important

283
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,100
for determining transmission.

284
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,950
And this spectrum on
the right we often get

285
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,360
from calculations, for example,

286
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,430
density functional theory calculations

287
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,220
and we will often calculate
this and then compare

288
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,700
to our experimental
measurements of conductance.

289
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,040
Okay, so how do we do these measurements?

290
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,840
I will go through this rather quickly.

291
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,840
It's a modified scanning tunneling
microscope except instead

292
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,020
of imaging to get a image in 2D,

293
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,640
we're going to operate this
in the I of Z kind of mode

294
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,900
where Z is the axis
perpendicular to the surface

295
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,190
and so we're just gonna smash

296
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,040
and then pull out this tip
relative to the substrate

297
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,290
and we're going to do
that thousands of times.

298
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,260
And if we do this in a solution
of molecules occasionally,

299
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,900
we trap a molecule in this junction

300
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,060
and we measure the current.

301
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,490
Okay, we can do this at
room temperature, as I said.

302
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,890
We also do this at times at four kelvin

303
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,110
and we collect many measurements

304
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,870
to get statistically meaningful results.

305
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,210
Okay, am I doing okay with the microphone?

306
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,680
Yes. Okay, good.

307
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,030
So how do, you know,

308
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,040
how do you know that what
I'm telling you is correct?

309
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,150
We'll just look at the data.

310
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,560
So here's a single pullout
trace measured on clean gold.

311
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,270
And so immediately what you see

312
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,270
is you have these discreet
jumps in conductance.

313
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,370
This is very kind of not classical.

314
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,050
Why are there discreet jumps?

315
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,430
Because a single gold atom

316
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,600
has one nearly perfectly
transmitting conductance channel.

317
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,540
So as you pull this junction
apart, you thin out the number

318
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,490
of gold atoms in the cross section

319
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,560
and you're removing conducting channels

320
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,460
and so your conductance
drops in these jumps

321
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,950
of integer multiples of G0.

322
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,900
This is very nice because at the very end,

323
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,030
you have this plateau at one G0

324
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,580
and when it ruptures, you open up this gap

325
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,020
and you know it's pristine,

326
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,760
because you just had a signature

327
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,260
of a single quantum point contact,

328
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,390
a single gold atom at the junction.

329
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,130
Okay, I'm just going to zoom in

330
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,560
and show this to you
on a logarithmic scale

331
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,450
so that you can see that after you rupture

332
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,090
that final plateau, conductance drops,

333
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,950
and then you have this kind of tunneling

334
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,430
through the vacuum gap
that you might expect.

335
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,170
Okay, we do this, as I said,

336
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,410
thousands of times to get
statistically meaningful results

337
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,683
and we analyze the data by
constructing histograms.

338
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,290
Okay, there we go.

339
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,483
This is a histogram

340
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:45,300
of 1,000 traces measured on
clean gold at room temperature.

341
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,060
And so, you know, we don't
select any of our data.

342
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,280
We bin every single trace we measure,

343
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,110
we put into this histogram.

344
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,970
And so the fact that we have peaks

345
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,190
at integer multiples of G0 means

346
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,120
that I didn't just select

347
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,460
a very pretty-looking
trace for you on the left.

348
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,680
I do in fact, very often, in fact,

349
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,110
in every single trace measure plateaus

350
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,110
at those integer multiples of G0

351
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,820
and this is my tunneling signature.

352
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,220
Okay, so now we're ready
to introduce molecules.

353
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,100
And so we're going to put molecules

354
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,780
that have been terminated, I apologize,

355
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,580
there's a little bit of a lag here.

356
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,413
There we go,

357
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,690
that have been functionalized

358
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,010
by some sort of linker group
that we know binds to gold.

359
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,320
Okay, so in this case it's the nitrogen

360
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,640
and the mean linker group.

361
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,850
And so what we see now is that
following the one G0 plateau,

362
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,990
we very often start

363
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,220
to see additional plateaus at
lower values of conductance.

364
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,400
And if we bin every
single trace we measure,

365
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,260
this is 10,000 traces, I believe,

366
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,970
we start to see peaks

367
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,000
at molecule-specific conductance values.

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,650
You know, to give you a
little bit more evidence

369
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,140
that these are really
single molecule signatures,

370
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,210
I will point out that
there's a shoulder here

371
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,340
and if you fit the
position of this shoulder,

372
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,850
its conductance is exactly
double the conductance

373
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,590
of the main peak.

374
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,240
I should say that actually this question

375
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,100
of is this a single molecule or not

376
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,760
has largely been settled
over the last 20 years or so.

377
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,640
This field is kind of reaching maturity.

378
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,630
Okay, so there's one more
piece of kind of tool set

379
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,390
that I have to show you,
which is another way

380
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,300
that we analyze this
data is by constructing

381
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,820
what we call 2D histograms where we now,

382
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,920
instead of just looking at the conductance

383
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,930
and bending the conductance axis,

384
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,470
we're going to align all our
traces along the sharp rupture

385
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,630
and kind of add them
all on top of each other

386
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,610
to create a sort of heat map.

387
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,490
So now we've bend both the conductance

388
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,410
as well as the displacement axis.

389
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,190
So this tells us on average,
as you pull the junction apart,

390
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,410
not only what is the average conductance,

391
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,410
but also how long on average
does this molecule stay

392
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,803
in the junction before the
whole junction falls apart.

393
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,440
Okay, so these are 2D histograms.

394
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,450
And then here on the right you can see,

395
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,830
I don't think you can see my pointer,

396
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,440
but a 1D histogram turned on its side.

397
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,150
Okay, I hope that's clear enough.

398
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,640
And so now we can do
some interesting stuff.

399
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,430
So this technique is very sensitive

400
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,230
to the structure of the molecule.

401
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,800
So for example, if I measure
conductance of molecules

402
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,750
of different lengths,
here measuring conductance

403
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,120
of alkanes all terminated
with the nitrogen,

404
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,060
you see that the conductance
decays with length.

405
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,150
Of course we make histograms
and we look at the average.

406
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,340
And indeed once this appears,

407
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,010
you will see that the conductance decays,

408
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,133
as we predicted,
exponentially with length.

409
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,313
I see it on my computer.

410
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,970
I think it just needs a moment.

411
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,508
So it decays exponentially
with length. There you go.

412
00:17:45,508 --> 00:17:46,950
(chuckles) There it is.

413
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,213
And, you know,

414
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,860
as expected, so this is tunneling, right?

415
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,353
Quantum tunneling, and it went too far.

416
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,910
And the other kind of interesting thing

417
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,650
is that the decay depends

418
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,260
on which molecular family you probe.

419
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,260
So oligophenylling, so oligophenyls,

420
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,750
which I don't know who the audience is,

421
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,180
so I think it's kind of
obvious for a chemist.

422
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,210
But, you know, I think we
all kinda have intuition

423
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,500
that this little benzene ring,

424
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,660
which is kind of the basic
building block of graphene,

425
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,430
has the localized pi system,
which in graphene results in,

426
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,650
you know, a lot of the
properties of graphene.

427
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,410
And in this case, this
delocalized pi system means

428
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,200
that this set of molecules
is more conductive than

429
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,970
the saturated set of molecules

430
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,370
and so the conductance decays more slowly.

431
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,750
And so this is kind of interesting,

432
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,970
this is signature of pi transport,

433
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,980
whereas this sharper decay is signature

434
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,060
of sigma transport.

435
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,550
And so you can kind of
understand which one

436
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,533
is which by looking at these trends.

437
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,680
Okay, so this is quantum tunneling

438
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,830
and this is so sensitive
to the molecular structure

439
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,290
that something that we're
working on in my lab,

440
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,600
I won't tell you about it in detail today,

441
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,910
but using this technique for biosensing.

442
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,940
So, for example, we've shown
that we can distinguish signals

443
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,180
from adenine and adenosine, for example.

444
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,640
And so we're working to see
whether we can apply this

445
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,500
to other bio-sensing applications.

446
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,290
It's a sort of new spectroscopy, okay.

447
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,970
So the main subject of my talk

448
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,910
is engineering quantum properties

449
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,220
in these molecular
circuits with chemistry.

450
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,210
And I first will tell you a story about

451
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,410
how we can create a single molecule switch

452
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,240
or a single molecule sensor,
depending on your perspective,

453
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,810
by manipulating quantum
interference in these junctions.

454
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,830
So to do this, I actually have
to tell you that, you know,

455
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,680
I held something back and I
didn't tell you another thing

456
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,200
that's important in determining transport

457
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,033
in these junctions.

458
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:45,900
So I told you about energy level alignment

459
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,170
and level broadening that
results in this broadening here,

460
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,340
but if my claim is correct,
the transport here is coherent,

461
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,710
then symmetry will be important,

462
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,980
because this electron wave incident

463
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,260
on the junction can tunnel across both

464
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,170
or more than two molecular orbitals

465
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,540
as long as they're nearby in energy.

466
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,780
And whether or not the transmitted wave

467
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,550
will interfere constructively

468
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,110
with itself after it crosses
these two available kind of,

469
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,110
you know, channels or destructively,

470
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,613
that depends on the symmetry
of these molecular orbitals.

471
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,420
So, really, if this seems mysterious,

472
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,235
it's actually just a property
of the fact that this is,

473
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:31,530
you know, a quantum phenomenon.

474
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,080
And so if we wanna look at
the transmission probability,

475
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
we have to square the amplitude.

476
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,250
And in this case, the
amplitude is actually a sum

477
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,190
of two amplitudes and so
if you square them here,

478
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,620
you're going to always
get an interference term.

479
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,610
And the symmetry of these two

480
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,200
will determine whether this is positive,

481
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,360
in which case, it's
constructive interference,

482
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,130
or whether this term is negative,

483
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,593
which just means it's
destructively interfering.

484
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,530
Okay, and this has been shown before.

485
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,150
We're definitely not the first

486
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,390
to find quantum interference
effects in molecular junctions.

487
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,910
There's been evidence
of pi-pi interference

488
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,580
where all the channels,
the HOMO, the LUMO,

489
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,010
and other frontier orbitals
are pi in character.

490
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,830
And so when the electron
crosses this junction,

491
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,500
there's interference between
the different pi channels.

492
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,610
There's also evidence

493
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,460
between different sigma
channels interfering.

494
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,310
But what we showed is that
actually you don't need there

495
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,940
to be, you know, only sigma,
only pi in certain cases,

496
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,300
sigma and pi type channels can
interfere with it themselves,

497
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,320
and this gives you a little
bit more kind of tunability

498
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,690
and you can kind of
synthetically modify this

499
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,680
a little bit more easily.

500
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,900
So the specific system we're going

501
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,230
to be looking at is this
pyrazine molecule over here,

502
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,390
which, again, it's very well known

503
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,520
that if you bind linker groups

504
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,830
to a benzene in the para position, again,

505
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,480
that's kind of chemistry jargon,

506
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,000
you bind a linker group
at one and at four,

507
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,090
and so this molecule
binds to gold through one

508
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,440
and four positions,

509
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,050
you're going to get
constructive interference.

510
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,060
Whereas if you put a linker group at one

511
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,550
and three, then you get
destructive interference,

512
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,060
because of the symmetry of
the HOMO and LUMA pi orbitals.

513
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,890
And what we show is that in pyrazine,

514
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,730
we can actually flip this and

515
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,880
reverse this trend and
then further engineer it.

516
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,840
So how does this work?

517
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,720
So this is the work of
my student Hannah Skipper

518
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,340
who actually graduated.

519
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,380
I should say PhD here.

520
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,480
She graduated a few months ago.

521
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,780
So she realized that this
trend of constructive

522
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,980
and destructive interferences
in benzene, again,

523
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,400
it results from the fact
that the LUMO has a symmetric

524
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,640
with respect to where
the gold electrodes bind,

525
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,381
whereas the HOMO is antisymmetric.

526
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:48,810
And there's actually an extra phase change

527
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,100
that you have to account for,

528
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,440
because one is HOMO, one is LUMO,

529
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,330
just take my word for it for now.

530
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,320
And so this one is symmetric,
this one is antisymmetric,

531
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,210
and then another extra phase change,

532
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,520
you actually get
constructive interference,

533
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,950
electron waves add in phase.

534
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,870
And again, if you look through

535
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,840
and see how it all works out
on the one-three positions,

536
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,450
you see that you will get
out-of-phase addition.

537
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,390
And so what's interesting,
again, this is very well known.

538
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,990
By the way, destructive
interference looks like a dip

539
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,490
in the transmission spectrum.

540
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,160
That means conductance is very low,

541
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,390
whereas constructive interference
looks like this no dip.

542
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,121
So that's the heuristic. Okay,
so what happens in pyrazine?

543
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:34,290
So in pyrazine, the introduction
of these two nitrogen atoms

544
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,140
actually rearranges the
electronic structure, right?

545
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,560
So now our HOMO is
actually a sigma orbital,

546
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,960
but what's important is
that the symmetry of the

547
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,090
sigma orbital reversed compared
to what we had in benzene.

548
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,760
And so now if you do the
same kind of analysis

549
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,610
and you compare the symmetry
of the LUMO and the HOMO,

550
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,120
you find that you actually
expect destructive interference

551
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,150
when you connect the molecule
in the para orientation

552
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,510
and then constructive interference
in the meta orientation.

553
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,940
And again, if this seems
mysterious, really,

554
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,920
all you need to do is you need

555
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,560
to put two Lorentzian line shapes

556
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,360
in the HOMO and LUMO position

557
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,090
and then you need to encode this symmetry

558
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,640
that we observe here in
the gas phase molecules.

559
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,930
And if you just do that

560
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,000
and then square the added amplitude,

561
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
you get a sharp dip at fermi
which predicts no conductance.

562
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,320
Okay, so does this work in experiments?

563
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm going to show you histograms
measured from thousands

564
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,380
of traces at room temperature.

565
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,410
And so I'm going to compare
the conductance of pyrazine,

566
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,000
which can only bind

567
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,850
to the two nitrogens in the para position,

568
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,140
to these two other molecules which

569
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,870
this one has combined in the
para and the meta position.

570
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,910
So the one-three pathway is available,

571
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,910
because this thiomethyl
linker is a known linker.

572
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,380
It binds to gold.

573
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,240
And this one only has

574
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,220
the meta pathway open to it.

575
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,690
And so if you measure conductance,

576
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,940
indeed you see no signal,

577
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,350
no discernible molecular signal
for the pyrazine situation,

578
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,590
whereas these two have a
sharp a molecular feature.

579
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,423
And what's more,

580
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,260
the feature is very
similar between the two,

581
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,880
suggesting that in both cases,

582
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,760
these molecules bind through
the one-three pathway

583
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,770
and conduct through the one-three pathway.

584
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,620
So again, we know that
the nitrogen can bind,

585
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,690
because this molecule binds,

586
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,690
but somehow when only the
para pathway is available,

587
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,020
we get no signal.

588
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,690
So it's binding, but there's no signal,

589
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,213
as if this doesn't conduct, it's off.

590
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,270
Okay, this is interesting.

591
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,460
We can look at it with a little,

592
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,730
in a little bit more detail using DFT.

593
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,310
All I really want to say
here is that the model

594
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,830
that I've used that I've
shown you here in green,

595
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,990
and it will show it to
you again in a minute,

596
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,610
is a very simple model I just
add to complex line shapes

597
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,980
and I see that I get
destructive interference.

598
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,140
DFT has a lot more details.

599
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,030
It's a full abend issue of calculation

600
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,780
with all the details of the
junction and the electrodes

601
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,610
and the electronic structure of gold.

602
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,910
And yet if you focus on this black trace,

603
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,950
which is predicting the transmission

604
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,780
of the vertical geometry

605
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,440
and you compare it to what
I showed you before here

606
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,620
in green, you see a very similar result.

607
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,940
So that suggests

608
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,030
that this very simple model

609
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,810
captures all the salient features

610
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,643
of the junction,

611
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:34,860
that you get destructive
interference when the molecule

612
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,920
is fully stretched out in the junction,

613
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,263
which is how we're probing it.

614
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,460
This also confirms that
the LUMO has pi character

615
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,080
and the HOMO has sigma character,

616
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,650
so it kind of validates
our experimental result.

617
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,570
But the reason I think this is exciting is

618
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,250
because this is just the beginning, right?

619
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,020
Now you can start to do chemistry

620
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,540
and you can synthetically
tune this molecule

621
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,100
to tune this effect.

622
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,270
So for example, if you add
a hydroxy subsistent now,

623
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,780
DFT predicts now this
gray transmission trace,

624
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,190
which predicts, you know,

625
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,830
a much better conductance
at the fermi energy.

626
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,210
Why is that?

627
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,590
Well, that's because actually

628
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,600
by just introducing that substituent,

629
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,660
you've, again, reorganized
the molecular orbitals.

630
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,960
Now you've pushed the sigma
orbital further in energy,

631
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,670
you've brought back the pi.

632
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,020
Now all three of these

633
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,140
are fairly somewhat degenerate in energy.

634
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,330
They all contribute to transmission.

635
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,810
And if you now predict
transmission based on the addition

636
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,610
of three components

637
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,390
with the symmetry we observe
here, you get this green trace,

638
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,050
which again matches very
well with a DFT calculation,

639
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,330
suggesting that now we've kind of,

640
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,580
you know, tuned the conductance just

641
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,500
by tuning the structure of the molecule.

642
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,030
What's even more exciting is now

643
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,480
what happens if you deprotonate
that hydroxy substituent?

644
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,730
Well, now you've totally
shipped your spectrum

645
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,370
and you predict a sharp
turn on of conductance,

646
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,873
you've kind of, you know,

647
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,020
made destructive interference go away.

648
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,280
So does this work?

649
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,530
Well, I probably wouldn't
be telling you about it

650
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,520
if it didn't.

651
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,680
So (chuckles) here's the measurement

652
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,490
of this hydroxypyrazine
in neutral pH conditions.

653
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,610
This broad feature over
here is well known to be due

654
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,010
to this pi-pi stacking
of multiple molecules

655
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,843
in the junction.

656
00:28:20,843 --> 00:28:22,500
It's not what we're looking for.

657
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,200
If you now just add a drop of base,

658
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,120
literally on your junction,

659
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,470
you see a sharp turn on of conductance

660
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,720
and you can see it here in
the two dimensional histogram,

661
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,300
these very flat plateaus.

662
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,133
And, you know,

663
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,740
the unexpected thing is
that there were two peaks.

664
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,240
Why are there are two peaks?

665
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,670
Well, here's the para conductance we think

666
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,360
from DFT calculations
and it just so turns out

667
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,880
that this molecule can also bind

668
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,970
through this deprotonated
phenol or the oxygen,

669
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,120
which we later on kind of
looked into more detail

670
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,360
and found that indeed
phenols bind to gold.

671
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,930
So bottom line is by
engineering these molecules

672
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,490
or synthetically tuning them,

673
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,680
we've turned off destructive interference.

674
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,980
And so now we have this
sort of, again, either from,

675
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,060
depending on your point of view,

676
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,020
either a pH sensor or a
switch where, you know,

677
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,760
conductance is off in the state

678
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,740
and then once you remove the proton,

679
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,333
you turn conductance on.

680
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,030
So, you know, so hopefully I convinced you

681
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,290
that quantum effects are
relevant in these systems.

682
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,210
And so the next story I will tell you,

683
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,190
and maybe I'll pause and see
if there are any questions

684
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,395
before I move on to the next
story, yeah, in the back?

685
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:40,740
(indistinct)

686
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,630
Oscillation, so everything
here is DC. It's DC current.

687
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,940
So I don't know exactly

688
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,683
what oscillation you have in mind.

689
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,577
- [Participant] One second (indistinct).

690
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,900
- Oh, sorry.

691
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,723
- [Farnaz] I think they're
done with the question.

692
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,410
- All right, okay, so I'll continue,

693
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,440
and then if there's
questions, just stop me.

694
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,150
So the next story I'll tell you

695
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:10,050
is how we can use
actually radical character

696
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,780
to engineer conductors

697
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,900
or single-molecule
conductors in these systems.

698
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,903
And so in the very beginning, I told you,

699
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,190
that can conductance decays exponentially,

700
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,740
which makes this a very sensitive,

701
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,880
it's a very sensitive system
for kind of, you know,

702
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,340
sensing different molecular structures.

703
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,400
But if you are trying to think
of how can we use molecules

704
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,370
for some sort of real-world
application down the line

705
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,280
or just how can we simplify
studying these systems,

706
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,080
it's actually not trivial,

707
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
because it means that beyond about

708
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,580
a nanometer or so, your
conductance is zero.

709
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,680
And so a molecule longer
than an nanometer,

710
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,350
you can't study it, because
you can't detect it.

711
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,690
So it would be great
if we could find a way

712
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,090
to reverse conductance decay.

713
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,980
And so I'll tell you a story that shows

714
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,030
that we actually can,

715
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,990
and so it's a recent development

716
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,480
that's kind of turning by us and others,

717
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,790
but turning this whole field
on its head a little bit.

718
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,020
So, you know, topological
phase transition,

719
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,830
kind of a loud buzzword, but
bear with me, if you will.

720
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,830
So this was suggestion by
Hoffman as well as Jelinek,

721
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,970
showing that, you know,

722
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,050
a single polymer and this will
be demystified in a second,

723
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,860
can actually have two distinct
or more topological phases.

724
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,860
And, you know, if you
can switch this phase,

725
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,500
you can go from something
that's rather boring

726
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,350
and has a wide band gap and
doesn't conduct very well,

727
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,870
to something that has
a very narrow band gap

728
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,400
and is a good conductor.

729
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,280
So what are these topological phases?

730
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,340
So it turns out that you
can actually think of them

731
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,680
or they're actually synonymous

732
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,420
with resonance structures.

733
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,980
So a typical, you know,

734
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,980
prototypical system like polyacetylene,

735
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,120
of course, is really
only stable in this form.

736
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,790
It's not possible to get
it to this structure,

737
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,880
but nothing keeps you from
drawing that structure.

738
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,060
And if you kind of draw the analogy

739
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,243
to topological states, you
realize that in this case,

740
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,530
you generate this electron
density at the edges

741
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,630
and these electrons are radicals, right?

742
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,080
They're unpaired, and it's constraint.

743
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,640
There's just not enough electrons

744
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,070
to pair them up if you
move your double bonds

745
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,560
to these positions.

746
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,520
And so this

747
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,370
is our topologically
trivial closed shell system.

748
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,870
And with the same number of electrons,

749
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,260
we have this topologically,
non-trivial phase,

750
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,000
this topological insulator.

751
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,070
And you can actually see it in SDM,

752
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,920
so this is, again, is the
work by Jelinek showing that

753
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,870
by synthetically tuning this polymer,

754
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,980
you go from the kind of typical
delocalized HOMO orbital

755
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,690
to this HOMO orbital

756
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,110
where there's increased density
of electrons on the edges,

757
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,040
and so that's your
topological insulator phase.

758
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,680
And so a few years ago,

759
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,980
the group of Latha
Venkataraman at Columbia showed

760
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,670
that these topologically
non-trivial phases actually result

761
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,250
in this inverse conductance decay.

762
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,260
So for example, cumulene,

763
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,630
which I'll talk more about why it relates

764
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,040
to topological insulators,

765
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,110
if it's not obvious to you already.

766
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:23,460
But if you measure cumulene
as a function of their length,

767
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,920
instead of the typical decay in red,

768
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,510
you now see that the conductance

769
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,310
of these molecules actually grows

770
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,800
as you make the molecule longer.

771
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,190
And this is a cartoon, the
actual data is shown here.

772
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,330
It's a little hard to see.

773
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,920
I'll zoom it in for you later,

774
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,060
but there's a slight growth of conductance

775
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,500
as the molecules get longer.

776
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,660
And a similar situation also happens

777
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,570
if you make these charged diradicals,

778
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,403
so these are

779
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,210
dication on diradicals.

780
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,100
And if you look at this top line here,

781
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,800
which is the relevant
experimental line, again,

782
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,410
the conductance stays mostly flat

783
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,840
as you add extra benzene rings here.

784
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,880
So B1 is just one benzene ring

785
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,700
and B3 is three benzene rings, and so on.

786
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,300
And conductance stays, you
know, at least doesn't decay.

787
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,770
And then as you make the
molecule even longer, at some,

788
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,550
you revert to this traditional
decay of conductance.

789
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,660
And so we were interested

790
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,630
in seeing whether we can
push this trend further.

791
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,430
Can we make molecules that,

792
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:30,270
as you make them longer, the
conductance keeps going up?

793
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,100
And of course we had to pair
up with some synthetic chemists

794
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,510
or magicians, as I call them,

795
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,340
because they make these
wonderful materials.

796
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,220
So Mike Haley at University of Oregon

797
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,690
and my student, Brent,

798
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,760
kind of realized that these sets

799
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,280
of benzoquinone derivatives

800
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,970
that they make are good
candidates for this study,

801
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,760
because they have intermediate
diradical character.

802
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,140
So I have to apologize.

803
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,460
There's multiple notations

804
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,710
with how you denote diradical character.

805
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,250
So in this talk, I'll mostly
use this convention delta.

806
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,570
And so I don't know if you remember,

807
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,500
I had the slide where negative
one means fully diradical

808
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,040
and positive one is boring
closed shell system.

809
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,510
And so the fact that these are closed

810
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,470
to zero means they have
significant diradical character

811
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,626
kind of in, you know, just
in neutral conditions.

812
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:23,670
So where's the Dirac
character coming from?

813
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,713
Again, it's probably,

814
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,100
well, it wasn't obvious to me (chuckles)

815
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,440
because I'm not, I'm trained in physics.

816
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,000
But it turns out that this
benzoquinone structure is,

817
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,020
there's stability conferred by
making this benzene aromatic.

818
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,640
And so the penalty,

819
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,940
energetic penalty paid for
splitting up this loan pair

820
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,370
is made up for the aromaticity benefit.

821
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,670
And so as a result, you get
this resonance structure

822
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,080
between the two and both

823
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,660
of these resonance structures are present

824
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,630
and contribute in solution.

825
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,390
Okay, so one more thing
is that they've engineered

826
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,580
these thioanisole linker groups,

827
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,500
which have a thiomethyl in the ends

828
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,350
and that allows for this
molecule to bind to gold

829
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,720
and allows us to trap it in the junction.

830
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,160
So what do we see, okay?

831
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,500
So I'm going to show you
conductance histograms

832
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,430
of a series of these
benzoquinone derivatives,

833
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,210
so this is BQ1 to BQ3.

834
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,250
And if you make a conductance histogram

835
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,050
of measurement made at low bias,

836
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,100
you immediately see

837
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,250
this very drastic
inverse conductance decay

838
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,120
or anti-omic conductance as we call it,

839
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,160
where the longest molecule has

840
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,030
by far the highest conductance
by a few orders of magnitude.

841
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,000
You can make a two-dimensional
histogram just to make sure

842
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,850
that you're not just somehow,
I don't know, you know,

843
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,530
reacting these molecules.

844
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,750
And this gives you a nice check,

845
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,480
because you see that as
the molecule gets longer,

846
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,470
the plateau the

847
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,850
kind of length that this molecule persists

848
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,890
in the junction also gets longer.

849
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,680
So that's a nice test that, for example,

850
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,850
this one is the longest,

851
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,610
that we're measuring what
we think we're measuring.

852
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,260
If you go to higher bias, this
is about 200, 300 millivolts.

853
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,500
This effect gets even more
exaggerated where, again,

854
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,070
the conductance of the longest
molecule is a few orders

855
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,890
of magnitude higher than that
of the shortest molecule.

856
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,290
So I can just kind of
simply summarize this

857
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,230
by plotting the average
conductance as a function

858
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,493
of molecule length.

859
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:31,920
It's, oh...

860
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,671
Suspense.

861
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:34,504
(audience laughs)

862
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:35,910
And you're gonna see, you know,

863
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,590
basically conductance goes up
as the molecule gets longer.

864
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,590
And again, ta-da, to emphasize now,

865
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,860
instead of DK, right,
beta is now negative,

866
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,180
so we have growth.

867
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,360
So this is inverse
conductance decay, okay?

868
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,370
The really neat thing about the system

869
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,490
is that unlike previously
measured diradicals,

870
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,710
these are neutral and quite stable.

871
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,840
And so we can actually ramp the bias

872
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,190
and collect IV curves to
characterize the conductance

873
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,210
of a variety of bias voltages.

874
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,160
So we can collect IV curves on thousands

875
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,480
of such measurements.

876
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,650
So that's what I'm showing you here.

877
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,483
This is now

878
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,430
a 2D histogram of IV curves

879
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,710
that I've added up on top of each other

880
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,000
and I've plotted the average
behavior with this white line.

881
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,030
And, you know, don't ask
me why, but in this field,

882
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,510
it's very common to plot IV
curves on a semi-log scale.

883
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,450
So it's hard to tell whether
something's linear or not.

884
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,450
So for that purpose,
I've plotted these dashed

885
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,680
or rather Brent, my student,

886
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,510
plotted dashed curves which
are actually linear IV curves.

887
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,830
And so right away, you see
that these IVs are not linear

888
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,790
and that indicates

889
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,700
that you have a molecular
resonance within range.

890
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,200
So as you open the bias gap,

891
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,790
you're starting to hit
these resonance peaks

892
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:58,380
and that indicates a small
HOMO-LUMO gap in these systems.

893
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,650
Okay, so plotting this
all on top of each other,

894
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,450
so you can compare the conductance

895
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,430
of these series of molecules.

896
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,830
And I've also converted
current to conductance

897
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,540
by dividing by the voltage.

898
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,300
You see, clearly, first of
all, that the HOMO-LUMO gap,

899
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,160
which you can kind of,

900
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,220
is this kind of width between the turn on

901
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,890
of current is a proxy for HOMO-LUMO gap,

902
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,870
decreases with molecule length.

903
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,660
And that's what you expect
for really any molecule.

904
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,920
Like your particle in a box,

905
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,620
you make the box bigger,
the HOMO-LUMO gap shrinks.

906
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,810
But what's really
remarkable in this system

907
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,960
is that the zero bias
conductance increases.

908
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,240
And it increases by two
orders of magnitude,

909
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,970
which is not something
that's been observed to date.

910
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,680
And so why is this happening?

911
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,410
So if you allow me, I know
I'm running a little bit long,

912
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,330
but I'll try to go through this fast,

913
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,730
because it's kind of, I
think this is exciting,

914
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,980
but to understand what's going on,

915
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,460
you have to kind of go back
to your tight binding model,

916
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,860
which is synonymous with 1D-SSH

917
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,140
and parameterize the system

918
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,740
to understand why we have
these closing HOMO-LUMO gaps

919
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,770
and why we have this
increasing conductance.

920
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,910
So polyacetylene has
been worked out years ago

921
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,270
and, you know, one way
to kind of understand

922
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,980
the different topological structures

923
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,560
is to realize that the
double bond is just really

924
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,000
a hopping parameter.

925
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,110
Where there's a double bond,

926
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,030
the hopping probability is higher.

927
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,880
And so if you describe
the hopping probability

928
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,010
in terms of delta like this,

929
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,780
then all you have to
know is that when delta

930
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,010
is greater than one,

931
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,860
you have this kind of structure where this

932
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,430
is higher hopping probability,

933
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,050
so you have a double bond there.

934
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,120
And when delta is less than one,

935
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,170
then you have this other topological state

936
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,780
where now you've moved
your double bond over.

937
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,390
And so by parameterizing
like this, you can now

938
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,640
just write your simple
tight-binding Hamiltonian,

939
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,050
for those of you who are interested,

940
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,630
and now you can solve it
as a function of delta,

941
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,030
because t1 and t2 depend on delta.

942
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,880
So when you solve it for
different values of delta,

943
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,780
you get the following.

944
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,650
You get your boring wide band gap molecule

945
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,300
when delta is equal to one.

946
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,270
You get narrowing HOMO-LUMO
gap when delta decreases.

947
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:10,260
And finally in the topological
state, you get no gap.

948
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,950
You get a gapless semiconductor, okay?

949
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,550
So this is just extrapolated
for all values of delta.

950
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,490
And now we can take this spectrum,

951
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,290
these are just eigenstate solutions

952
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,150
to this tight-binding Hamiltonian

953
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,580
and we can use non-equilibrium
Green's function

954
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,810
to calculate transmission.

955
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:28,643
So all you have to do is,

956
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:30,450
I'm just gonna take these resonances

957
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,480
and now I'm going to
predict transmission, okay?

958
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,520
So for this

959
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,180
boring wide band gap

960
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,410
molecule, you get wide bang gap,

961
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,253
and so you have low conductance
at the fermi energy.

962
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,310
For the intermediate case,

963
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,890
you have a narrower HOMO-LUMO gap

964
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,690
and so you have higher conductance,

965
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:56,310
and for this topological
system, you get no gap.

966
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,390
But of course it's impossible
to stabilize the system,

967
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:04,050
and so I'm going to look at
this delta equal to 0 case,

968
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,340
the intermediate case,

969
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,460
because there's actually
a physical analog to this,

970
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,670
and we can see whether this model agrees

971
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,290
with experimental results.

972
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,380
So the physical model I'm
going to use is cumulene.

973
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,690
I know it's not the same exactly,

974
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,570
but it's a system where you
have perfect delocalization,

975
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,660
because you have these
double bonds at every site.

976
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,010
And so, you know, I think this
is a reasonable approximation

977
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,420
to the cumulene case.

978
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,600
And the cumulene case has
been measured experimentally.

979
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,300
And I already mentioned to
you that what they measured

980
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,900
is a very kind of gradual
slight increase in conductance.

981
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,610
So if you look here, it's, you know,

982
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,530
it's all within one order of magnitude.

983
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,660
It's within actually half
an order of magnitude.

984
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,340
So it's basically flat.

985
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,900
You make the molecules longer

986
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,790
and the conductance stays flat.

987
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,080
And if you look here,

988
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,720
that's exactly what our model predicts.

989
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,620
So this 1D-SSH predicts that
you make the molecules longer,

990
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,750
but the conductance here at fermi,

991
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,020
which is where we measure
it, stays the same.

992
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,580
So how can this be?

993
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,240
So the only way that you can
have a closing HOMO-LUMO gap,

994
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,570
but a conductance that doesn't
increase is if you have some

995
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,810
sort of destructive quantum
interference canceling the fact

996
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,640
that the gap is closing.

997
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,230
So this is really a signature

998
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,570
that there's destructive
quantum interference effects

999
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,383
at play here that keep
your conductance low.

1000
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,640
And this is just showing that if you look

1001
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,900
at delta equal to 0,

1002
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,510
the CQI terms, the
constructive interference

1003
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,730
really cancel out the
destructive interference,

1004
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,360
and so you just get flat
conductance, no enhancement.

1005
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,780
Okay, what about these molecules?

1006
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,980
And now we'll just, you know,

1007
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,900
reveal the result that there

1008
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,180
is no such destructive
quantum interference

1009
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,410
in these molecules and

1010
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,040
that's why you have this
dramatic increase in conductance.

1011
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,130
So just briefly, how do we see this?

1012
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:01,083
We have to remake our 1D-SSH
model for the cyclic system.

1013
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,050
Again, these are a bunch of details,

1014
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,540
but we have to introduce
two more hopping parameters

1015
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,390
and then make sure that
the delta equal to 0,

1016
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,310
all the hopping parameters are the same

1017
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,220
so that you really have this
fully delocalized system,

1018
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,480
like you expect.

1019
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,190
So if you do this parameterization,

1020
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,280
you can solve for the eigenvalue
spectrum of the system.

1021
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,790
Here it is. And now you can
predict transport, okay?

1022
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,260
You can predict conductance.

1023
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,700
So I'm going to show you
transmission curves for this...

1024
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,690
Lemme just go, for this BQ
series that you measure.

1025
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,700
And so if you zoom in at zero,

1026
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,070
you see that indeed in this case,

1027
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,810
this model predicts that

1028
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,500
as you make the molecules longer,
the conductance increases.

1029
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,930
And this is consistent with
what we see in experiments,

1030
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,990
so that's always a good
when that works out.

1031
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,990
And if you look at the
contribution of constructive

1032
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,090
and destructive quantum interference,

1033
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,580
you see that in this case,

1034
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,560
constructive interference dominates

1035
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,200
destructive interference effects, again,

1036
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,930
in contrast to the cumulene case.

1037
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,870
So, you know, the really
exciting thing here, I think,

1038
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,610
is that these,

1039
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,860
not just that we have this

1040
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,800
dramatic increase in
conductance anti-omic behavior,

1041
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,930
but that this is just the beginning.

1042
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,320
So, you know, maybe I'll
just skip this term.

1043
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,620
Basically these systems
are highly tuneable.

1044
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,800
And the model predicts,
so this is the BQ1 series

1045
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,820
that we've measured,

1046
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,670
plotted on the scale
of diradical character.

1047
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,840
And I apologize here.

1048
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,940
I'm using the diradical
character measurement

1049
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,000
that's more common in
synthetic organic literature.

1050
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,330
But the point is that using this scaffold,

1051
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,500
the BQ scaffold,

1052
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,220
which looks a little bit
like flakes of graphene here,

1053
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,340
and by adding substituents on the side,

1054
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,420
you can further tune diradical character.

1055
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,340
And if you can tune diradical character,

1056
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,710
you can tune the conductance enhancement.

1057
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,120
And that's indeed what we see.

1058
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,550
So we've measured the conductance

1059
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,560
of these kind of derivatives,

1060
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,890
which have these extra thiophene linkers,

1061
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,420
which they don't bind to gold.

1062
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,847
All they do is they
stabilize the diradical

1063
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:11,730
and so they increase
the diradical character.

1064
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,140
I realize there's a little,

1065
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,090
this actually is, again, a thioanisole,

1066
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,400
so the molecule binds
in exactly the same way

1067
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,470
as the previous set of molecules,

1068
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,680
but the key here is now
the conductance enhancement

1069
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,210
is further enhanced, right?

1070
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,700
So this is analogous to BQ1.

1071
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,250
It has higher conductance than BQ1.

1072
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,290
This is analogous to BQ2.

1073
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,500
And it has at least an
order of magnitude increase

1074
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,780
in conductance relative to BQ2.

1075
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,613
And so, you know,

1076
00:46:37,613 --> 00:46:40,140
if you can synthetically
tune these molecules,

1077
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,383
you can tune your conductance enhancement.

1078
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,630
Okay, so that's the end
of this kind of section.

1079
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:49,830
Again, hopefully I've convinced you

1080
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,940
that these graphene flake molecules

1081
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,430
have significant diradical character.

1082
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,250
And if you can synthetically tune them,

1083
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,920
then you can manipulate
this quantum effect

1084
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,140
to create your functional,

1085
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,110
highly conducting molecular junctions

1086
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,960
or other things that
maybe you can imagine.

1087
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,030
Okay, so I'm out of time,

1088
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,600
so I won't get to tell you about formation

1089
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,500
of 1D metal organic molecular wires.

1090
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,490
I'll just, you know,

1091
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,850
put this, hopefully exciting,
picture up on the screen,

1092
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,610
and I'm happy to talk to you about

1093
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,350
why it might be exciting to try

1094
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,080
to incorporate metal
atoms into the junction

1095
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,340
and why that's an
interesting thing to pursue.

1096
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:40,340
And with that, I just
have to thank my group.

1097
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,110
This somehow doesn't work the
way it's supposed to work.

1098
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,660
I just wanna find the picture of my group

1099
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,220
and I want to thank them.

1100
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,100
I really have a fantastic
group of students.

1101
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,190
I'm very grateful to be
working with all of them

1102
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:59,220
and I have great collaborators
and funding sources

1103
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,110
and I wanna thank you
again for your attention

1104
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,003
and I'm happy to take any questions.

1105
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,398
(audience applauding)

1106
00:48:08,398 --> 00:48:10,272
- Thanks for a wonderful talk.

1107
00:48:10,272 --> 00:48:13,260
So we have time for a few questions.

1108
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,370
- Hi, thank you.

1109
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,040
I'm curious what's the smallest molecule,

1110
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,660
or in that last part we didn't get to,

1111
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,470
the fewest number of atoms
you can pinch between the gold

1112
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,284
or get between the gold,
in terms of like nucleons?

1113
00:48:26,284 --> 00:48:29,160
- Yeah, so you always
have the linker group,

1114
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,840
which let's count that as one atom,

1115
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,730
like a nitrogen in an amine case.

1116
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,680
So you need that to anchor to gold.

1117
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,000
And then between that,

1118
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,070
the smallest reliably you can catch

1119
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,513
is two carbons or two nucleons

1120
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:44,013
So that's, so half an nanometer roughly.

1121
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,140
- Thank you for the great talk.

1122
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,830
So when you were showing your
IV curves for the BQn series,

1123
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,070
it seemed like going from BQ1 to BQ2,

1124
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,270
there was a very strong enhancement of

1125
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,920
the conductance value that you saw,

1126
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,810
but then from two to three,

1127
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,560
there seemed to be very
insignificant enhancement.

1128
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,050
Do you have any explanation for this?

1129
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,810
- Yeah, so it's definitely non-linear.

1130
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:16,320
I mean, basically you can
never exceed a conductance

1131
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,090
of one G0 here.

1132
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,460
So, you know, as you
make something longer,

1133
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,293
in the best case,

1134
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:24,660
it's just going to
asymptotically approach one,

1135
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,090
and that's kind of your limit here.

1136
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,340
Because you only have the, you know,

1137
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,843
it's just the one channel.

1138
00:49:32,414 --> 00:49:34,470
So that's basically why.

1139
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,300
So you get a large enhancement initially,

1140
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,440
but then it starts to
asymptotically approach.

1141
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,200
But, you know, actually
there's probably more to it.

1142
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,543
So, you know, at some point,

1143
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,750
you know, this has to break down, right?

1144
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,940
There's going to be localization

1145
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,410
and your conductance

1146
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,273
that's going to break your coherent,

1147
00:49:56,967 --> 00:49:57,867
the coherence in the molecule

1148
00:49:57,867 --> 00:50:00,510
and the conductance is
going to start decaying.

1149
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:04,383
So is that partly what we're
already seeing? Perhaps, yeah.

1150
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,850
- Hi, so in these diradical systems,

1151
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,200
you have an even number of electrons,

1152
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,150
but they're kinda
separated from each other.

1153
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,100
Do you open up any cool
spin physics with that?

1154
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,650
Or is the fact that they're still like all

1155
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,260
paired, kinda watch that out?

1156
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,790
- Well, certainly, so, you know,

1157
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,790
part of why these molecules got
attention in the literature,

1158
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,770
not in our work, but previously,

1159
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:30,480
is because actually there's
the exchange energies

1160
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,360
is fairly, is,

1161
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,740
you know, is fairly small.

1162
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,600
So certainly people are interested

1163
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,670
in studying the triplet state

1164
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:41,550
and I think you can access that at like

1165
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,200
as little as 50 degrees Celsius,

1166
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,443
or no, 50 degrees above room temperature.

1167
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,370
So, you know, that was always
in the back of our mind.

1168
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:55,200
So we don't see anything yet.

1169
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,430
Based on what we've done,

1170
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,050
my intuition is the triplet

1171
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,430
or singlet doesn't actually
matter for conductance.

1172
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,563
I don't have solid evidence for that.

1173
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,140
So there might be, we
just haven't found it yet,

1174
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,540
and of course creating
different spin multiplicities

1175
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,320
is one of the motivations

1176
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,110
for incorporating metal atoms
into your junction, right?

1177
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,780
You can have all sorts
of open shell character

1178
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,460
and you can have different
spin quantum number depending

1179
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,410
on the metal you incorporate.

1180
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,180
So we haven't seen anything yet,

1181
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,843
but, yes, that's certainly
something we're interested in.

1182
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:39,430
- (indistinct) Loud enough a little bit.

1183
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,950
- Thank you, Farnaz.

1184
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,053
Hey, so the Haley molecules,

1185
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,430
they're required to have
dispersed stability,

1186
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,080
they have these big bulky groups

1187
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,090
and so the phenols are exactly-

1188
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,560
- Yes, perpendicular.

1189
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,210
- There's no overlap there.
- Yep. No.

1190
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:58,620
- And so you have this
intervening little, you know,

1191
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,870
junction between in each side.

1192
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,970
And so I'm just wondering
how that, you know,

1193
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,650
earlier, you had direct bonding-

1194
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,140
- Exactly. Yeah.
- And so your gold

1195
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,090
is separated, how does
that figure into all your

1196
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,530
calculations and-
- Yeah.

1197
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,023
So I forget who I was talking to today,

1198
00:52:17,845 --> 00:52:20,160
and we were saying that, you know,

1199
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,340
10 years or so, the thought
was that you actually wanted

1200
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,250
as direct a contact to the
molecule from the metal

1201
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,030
as possible, 'cause that's
how you maximized conductance.

1202
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,290
So that's kind of to your point,

1203
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:34,740
but in these molecules, we have
decoupled them from the gold

1204
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,650
and it turns out that when
you have these radicals,

1205
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,540
this decoupling linker
is actually essential

1206
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:42,990
to seeing this effect,

1207
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,590
because if you couple it
too strongly to the metal,

1208
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:50,310
the diradical will just
escape into the metal

1209
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,350
and you will not see this enhancement.

1210
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,320
So actually that perpendicular,
as you were pointing out,

1211
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,700
the pi system is perpendicular,

1212
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:01,560
so the diradical is really kind
of decoupled from the metal,

1213
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,040
seems to be key to getting
this functionality.

1214
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,873
- Yeah, I guess,

1215
00:53:05,873 --> 00:53:07,110
I was thinking it almost
looks like you have

1216
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:09,390
a little quantum well between the two.

1217
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:10,410
- I see.
- And, you know,

1218
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,490
you have a barrier.

1219
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:15,090
That's how I would've like
thought about it is a quantum,

1220
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,040
two little barriers on either side, but...

1221
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,930
- You know, the wild thing,

1222
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,690
and the reason why it took
me a while to get my mind

1223
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,430
around this is that the conductance

1224
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:27,720
of that whole entire huge
molecule, for me that's huge,

1225
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,500
with the thioanisole, the
kinda graphene flake core,

1226
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,920
another thioanisole, the
conductance of that whole thing

1227
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,003
is higher than the conductance
of a single thioanisole.

1228
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,470
So the linker, so somehow the...

1229
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,240
So I don't know if you can describe it

1230
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,650
by this double barrier model.

1231
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,660
My instinct right now is, no,

1232
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:53,040
there's this fundamental
kind of transport,

1233
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,130
different transport
mechanism happening here.

1234
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,733
Yeah, but maybe we can discuss more, yeah.

1235
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,930
- So I'm going to ask one

1236
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,440
of the questions from our online audience.

1237
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,300
So the question is asking,

1238
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,060
how can we make functional
practical electronic devices

1239
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,260
with these molecular junctions

1240
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,270
and what are some of the applications?

1241
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,890
- That's a great question.

1242
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:19,590
Functional, yeah, I don't know,

1243
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,540
but maybe you know, Farnaz.

1244
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,215
Maybe that's a question for you.

1245
00:54:23,215 --> 00:54:24,664
(audience chattering)
(Masha chuckling)

1246
00:54:24,664 --> 00:54:26,964
- Can you comment on
some of the applications?

1247
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,420
- [Farnaz] Well, I mean, you know,

1248
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,857
I guess I would say that,

1249
00:54:32,857 --> 00:54:34,920
you know, the fundamental
limit to Moore's law,

1250
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,130
why can't we shrink down our
electronics even further?

1251
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:41,370
I mean, one way to kind of
restate that problem is that

1252
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,590
as you keep shrinking
your electronics past

1253
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,720
the 10 nanometer size scale,

1254
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,150
you no longer have bulk material,

1255
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,060
which is what you're relying
on to create the functionality.

1256
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:55,080
You have some sort of
zero D, right, object.

1257
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,450
These are quantum dot, if you
wanna think about it that way,

1258
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,283
or a molecule.

1259
00:54:58,283 --> 00:54:59,727
These are all zero D materials.

1260
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:03,840
And so if we want to push our
electronics to smaller sizes,

1261
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,520
we need to understand the kind

1262
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,180
of fundamental charge transport
processes taking place

1263
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,230
on this size scale.

1264
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,180
So that's kind of the motivation.

1265
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,910
How to make a functional device?

1266
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:16,540
- Yes, (chuckles) I don't know-

1267
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,200
- A lot of work in that area.
- Yes.

1268
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,763
- Any other questions?

1269
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,730
- Thank you. Really
fascinating, thank you.

1270
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,460
I have a related question to the one

1271
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:37,170
that was just asked about
any immediate application

1272
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,023
to improving quantum
coherence and computing?

1273
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,723
- Yeah, the tricky thing
here, it's kind of misleading.

1274
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:47,730
I probably can't answer,

1275
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,650
well, I definitely can't answer this fully

1276
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,480
in a short time period.

1277
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,620
So what the effects we
observe are due to coherence,

1278
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,920
but the molecule crosses this junction in,

1279
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,563
I dunno, a femtosecond timescale.

1280
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,900
And, you know, on a much slower timescale,

1281
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,900
this is all at room temperature,
everything's wiggling.

1282
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,420
And so in this tiny moment

1283
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,190
of time when the electron is crossing,

1284
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,530
it's not scattering,
everything's coherent,

1285
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,290
but the next time another one crosses,

1286
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,420
the system has fluctuated.

1287
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,380
So, yes, we're studying
coherent phenomena,

1288
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,780
but they're very short lived.

1289
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,780
And how we connect this
to a quantum computing,

1290
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,833
you know, is not clear to me.

1291
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:41,150
But certainly people do make
qubits out of molecules,

1292
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,980
but to do that, they have
to cool the system down

1293
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,203
to the millikelvin temperature.

1294
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:51,870
So yeah, we're certainly
thinking along those lines,

1295
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,170
but I'm not sure I have
a good answer for you.

1296
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,062
(indistinct)

1297
00:56:57,062 --> 00:56:59,100
- I asked.
- Right, right.

1298
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,310
I'm glad I sold you. (chuckling)

1299
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:06,180
It's true, but how do you
use it for quantum computing?

1300
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,450
Yeah, it's not obvious, but
at least we can probe these,

1301
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,710
I mean, the nice thing

1302
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:14,130
is that we can probe these
fundamental phenomena

1303
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,800
without having to cool to
millikelvin temperature.

1304
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,810
And I think that gives
us a lot of benefits.

1305
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,720
We can repeat the
experiments many, many times.

1306
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,170
We can easily modify things
without spending weeks,

1307
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:28,773
you know, creating these,
these systems, so yeah.

1308
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,090
- So we have ran out of time.

1309
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,469
So help me thank Masha again.

1310
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:36,302
(audience applauding)

1311
00:57:36,302 --> 00:57:39,360
Thanks, Masha.
- Thanks.

1312
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,630
- So we are going to have
a reception until 04:30.

1313
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,040
So Masha will be here.

1314
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,690
You can still have a
chance to talk to her.

1315
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,123
There's also food, so,
please, help yourself.

1316
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:52,744

(graphic taps)

1317
00:57:52,744 --> 00:57:55,295
