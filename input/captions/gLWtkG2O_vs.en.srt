1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:19,439
okay welcome everybody wonderful uh warm

2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,080
February Friday here and we're uh

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,199
continuing with our second topic for the

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,640
class first one being about um notes

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,040
pitches durations and now we're getting

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,559
to how to represent um bigger music SCH

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,000
scores

8
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,719
um I'm going to start though by jumping

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,520
back to uh topic one for a second I want

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:45,000
to uh talk through a couple things

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,199
first great job on pet one uh there I

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,760
can and I can say it's nice when you can

13
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,399
say that to the whole class without

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,079
putting uh for the most part P set one

15
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,840
was really great no every single P set

16
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,399
one was was very strong um there when

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,079
and that's that's my quick to second

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,519
overview of having the computer

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,400
automatically go through and just um

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,840
spit out every error that it detected

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,600
and I'll go through it by hand because

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,600
um and figure out places where there

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,439
might be partial credit where a mistake

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,520
early on was causing cascading problems

25
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,840
and uh things of that sort but um some

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,640
really really great things happening you

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,320
guys seem to be uh really strong on um

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,360
on Pitch names on representation on

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,079
manipulating transposing some really

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,560
really good work with inversions for the

31
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,799
most part which is some of the most

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,040
challenging parts of the problem set and

33
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,680
um yeah

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,600
so I'd love to dwell for the next hour

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,119
on everything you all did right uh give

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,799
yourself thumbs up for that but let's

37
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,680
let's talk a little bit on a couple of

38
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,640
the things that were challenging on the

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,719
problem sets some of them that um you

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,560
know that maybe I could have done better

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,960
some of them maybe you we could have

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
just thought that one one little bit

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,080
harder let's start with um the concept

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,480
of pitch class

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,959
um how many pitch classes are there

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,840
let's shout it out on three one two

47
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:22,160
three 12 12 and they're what 1 to

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,200
12 to 11 0 to 11 great super so we

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,040
almost all got that so and uh what's

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,680
what's a note that's pitch class zero c

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,000
c good good

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:39,200
so um let's see see if we know our major

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,920
scales pretty well pitch class uh four e

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,920
e good so four is

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,040
e e

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,400
flat

57
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,080
three e double

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,440
flat great triple

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,840
flat quadruple

60
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,680
flat quintuple

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,680
flat 11 so this ends up being this was

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,799
one of the things uh challenge that

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,599
there's a modulo operator right the you

64
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,200
know trying to make sure everything is

65
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:17,159
between 0 and 11 at first when you're

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,120
looking at the names see and so almost

67
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,120
everybody somewhere encoded right a a

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,760
array that looks something like this I

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,360
think 5 S I'm getting this right

70
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,640
91 who did something like that at some

71
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,599
point yeah and then um so if you didn't

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,360
do that and you encoded all of them then

73
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,120
the hard part was uh

74
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,959
nhar monx yeah if you said that one is C

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,799
sh o it's also d flat okay I think I've

76
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:55,439
got it but it's also you know very very

77
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,920
odd notes like um b double sharp oops I

78
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,040
should do a proper double sharp and not

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,840
a programmer's double sharp right

80
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,720
yeah things like that that's correct

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,760
right yeah um so if you did something

82
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,519
like this there's that weird thing that

83
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,840
almost that a lot of people um forgot

84
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,320
that when you get your modulo to get

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,440
everything into 02 4 5 79 11 by

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,840
stripping off the accidentals then you

87
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,120
start adding what is it you subtract one

88
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,240
for every Flat add one for every sharp

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,400
so you can do you can have your computer

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,560
be very smart at first with things that

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,560
um that's a e double sharp my

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,639
handwriting will get better um uh and

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:45,360
you can do that but remembering at the

94
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:47,759
end that oh if B is 11 that B Sharp is

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:56,000
not 11 +

96
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:56,000
1 but 11 + 1 what do I want to put after

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,520
that mod 12 yep good

98
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,120
good um so that was that was one thing

99
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,520
the other thing that came up quite a bit

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,840
and uh you're going to think that this

101
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:16,560
is a like a pretty dirty trick for me

102
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,560
let's start with this

103
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:28,199
um this is pitch set one this is pitch

104
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:31,560
set two is there a way we uh is there an

105
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:36,440
axis inversion somewhere that will let

106
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,440
us transform pitch set one to pitch set

107
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,680
2 no I'm seeing seeing some some nose

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,800
Matthew what you you had the first head

109
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,560
uh shock head head Rock what what how

110
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,080
did you compute that very fast did you

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,039
try all um all

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,199
132 possible axes of rotation and saw

113
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,960
that there were none uh the way that I

114
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,600
did it was I made sure that the

115
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,400
intervals of one were the negatives of

116
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,479
the intervals of the other great so what

117
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
when we're talking about the intervals

118
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,000
of one intervals pitch set one what's

119
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,000
the interval that we're looking at

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,120
here what do we call two and what's the

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,680
interval here two one if we're thinking

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
of chromatic what if we're thinking of

123
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,520
it in more of our traditional tonal

124
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
space what do we want to call this

125
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,800
one what's that whole step whole step

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,560
good another word for whole step usually

127
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:40,479
major second good and here half step

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,440
right or minor minor second good so you

129
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,680
knew that you weren't going to be able

130
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,000
to find that you didn't need to do all

131
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,440
the computation let's do one that's a

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,440
little bit

133
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,039
harder is there

134
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,639
something like that and can

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:13,680
we find some sort of an inversion ex of

136
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:16,680
inversion that allows us to transform it

137
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
into

138
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
that

139
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,240
why it's pretty obvious so go ahead take

140
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,039
always take the easy participation

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,039
points um when you when you

142
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,840
can one has four notes and the other has

143
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,520
one has four notes and the other one has

144
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,520
five notes

145
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,159
good uh I believe 15 out of the 17

146
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,120
problem sets turned in found that to be

147
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:48,919
acceptable because you weren't comparing

148
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,800
first the obvious thing that they had to

149
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,440
have the same number of notes um which

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,159
does happen quite often right that

151
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,560
you're going along and you're thinking

152
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,520
of here's a Triad here's a Triad here's

153
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,440
a seventh chord here's a Triad is there

154
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,840
a way that we can manipulate the first

155
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,080
Triad to be the second Triad yes is

156
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,840
there a way that we can manipulate the

157
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,720
second Triad to be the um the uh the

158
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,680
seventh chord the four note chord not

159
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,639
with the tools that we've learned so far

160
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,319
right so those are some things and a a

161
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,879
very very very small um th this one I

162
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
think is important because this will

163
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,759
come up in real music

164
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,639
everywhere very very very small problem

165
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,479
in this one this one you might hate your

166
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,479
professor for doing

167
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,599
that can p set one be converted to P at

168
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,599
two by

169
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,040
inversion yes because there's nothing

170
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,839
here you don't need to do any operation

171
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,399
or any operation you do to nothing can

172
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,560
transform it into this right if you

173
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,240
think about the reciprocal of or you

174
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,279
know the Nega negation of an empty set

175
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,320
it'll be sort of the empty set and that

176
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,560
that one I think I I put like one on10th

177
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,720
of 1% on because it's it's kind of a a

178
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,560
nasty thing but it was one of the cases

179
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,320
where uh unlike the fornote thing where

180
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,839
uh a lot of times the pro programs your

181
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,600
algorithms were returning the incorrect

182
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,600
answer uh this one was uh causing the

183
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:26,000
programs to crash quite a bit um couple

184
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,680
years ago I I didn't my uh automatic

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,560
assessment system didn't that was I I

186
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,800
stole it from gozi he's very generous

187
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,800
with that uh did not handle crashes very

188
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,600
well now you know it does so um we'll

189
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,000
we'll see that

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,640
so that's a big parenthesis around um

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,399
the fact that the pets were great we're

192
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,720
very very strong I think you should all

193
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,959
be uh proud on that but but keep keep

194
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,120
thinking of the corner cases uh I

195
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,079
especially liked how many um test cases

196
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
that I didn't write that I saw I mean I

197
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,519
was really really fast through the code

198
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,640
because you all just uh turned it in uh

199
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,800
this morning or late last night but for

200
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,839
the most part but I was I was very

201
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,000
impressed with how how much people were

202
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,079
trying to get at the corner cases and

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,240
things and that's a good thing to um

204
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,240
feel free to you know use that kind of

205
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,560
collaborative discussion and we're going

206
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,720
to encourage some collaborative

207
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,440
discussion uh in the next problem set

208
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,800
coming right up there was one other

209
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,160
thing besides U some reading and video

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,959
watching um that uh I asked you all to

211
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,000
do and I got some really great answers

212
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,839
and that was talking about um various

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,120
kinds of pitch representations what you

214
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,000
might do and uh what some of the

215
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,639
stakeholders um might be who who might

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,120
want a particular pitch

217
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,160
representation um and that might be

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,480
different from somebody else so anybody

219
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,680
and I read through them I'm going to um

220
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
you know say say some things too

221
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,720
especially uh things I found really

222
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,920
great and um if you know but but anybody

223
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,160
find anything that you thought was was

224
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,560
interesting to different groups or

225
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,360
audiences or stakeholders that that

226
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,240
might prefer very different

227
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,240
representations of

228
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,360
pitches yeah Vanessa I think it's

229
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,880
interesting to think like people that

230
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,680
are more into like editing and like

231
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,880
really analyzing sound files might be a

232
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,240
lot more interested in seeing like

233
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,639
frequency values suppos to if you have

234
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
like a musician who's reading sheet

235
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,959
music they look at a frequency value

236
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,120
doesn't mean anything to them yeah so

237
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,440
they would want one of and vales to be

238
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,360
able to understand what you're talking

239
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,680
about yeah yeah totally nobody nobody's

240
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,839
going to

241
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:48,079
see and uh I don't know

242
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,079
59.8 I'm just making these up

243
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:58,560
947 82 and be like that's my most

244
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,560
beautiful chord I just I just love that

245
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,720
it's very hard to do on the guitar but

246
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,079
when you get it just right yeah yeah so

247
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,120
definitely definitely different

248
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,880
stakeholders for different um for

249
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
different uh for different places

250
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,639
different agendas good um other um other

251
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,000
C so we have uh people sound editors and

252
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,440
um and musicians and we can refine that

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,720
either way thanks so that was great um

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,279
anybody else I

255
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,560
think yeah Matthew some people care

256
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,320
about anharmonic spelling and for some

257
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:37,519
people that's just access information

258
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:40,519
that's useless yes the big fight on N

259
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,519
harmonic

260
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:50,399
spelling yeah I just um got a bug report

261
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:56,279
in music 21 uh on Wednesday that music

262
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:59,959
21 was not properly calling uh this

263
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,959
um let see if I can even do it no um

264
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,680
maybe it was

265
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:08,199
here was not properly calling this a

266
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,000
dominant seventh chord I was saying it

267
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:14,639
was something

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,639
else but if we flip

269
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,959
this here actually maybe I hope I

270
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,959
actually wrote a dominant seventh sign

271
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,839
that sounds like a dominant seventh

272
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:27,480
chord um that's right right not I'm not

273
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,199
too far away from teaching music theory

274
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,600
for a year so yeah yeah

275
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,519
so I've am a stakeholder in enharmonic

276
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,120
spelling the bug report was from

277
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,440
somebody who um wasn't a stakeholder in

278
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,760
inharmonic spelling

279
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,000
great who who might not care about

280
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,399
inharmonic spelling yeah go ahead uh we

281
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,519
could say like a guitarist who doesn't

282
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,759
know sheet music yeah totally totally or

283
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,880
who or who's doesn't who who's TR maybe

284
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,600
if they they just be a little more inous

285
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,800
maybe

286
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,480
they they know something but it's

287
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,680
translating from the sheet into the

288
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,519
tablet or into the position before

289
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,480
translating to the next stage of mental

290
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:16,079
processing right I mean we do that a lot

291
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,279
people who are native speakers in um in

292
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,880
two languages don't translate from one

293
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,560
language to another before there's um um

294
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,560
before there's you know some kind of

295
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,240
conception whereas when I'm learning a

296
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,560
new language it's always going through

297
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,880
English before it has a meaning to me

298
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,920
yeah so so that uh somebody who plays

299
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,399
guitar might be translating what they're

300
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,279
saying to a fret position and then

301
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:44,519
saying Ah that's great you see that uh

302
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:47,560
quite often in um in a lot of fake book

303
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,680
scores in things where you'll see um I

304
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,240
don't know well same same type of thing

305
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,519
you'll see like E flat minor on

306
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,240
something and then you'll read on that

307
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,600
the the chord

308
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,440
I think that's right

309
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,360
um quite often you know or some

310
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,320
something like that in a melody and well

311
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,160
obviously the that's not but because

312
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,040
it's all about translating it uh first

313
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,440
that's good good other

314
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,720
stakeholders or other interesting people

315
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,399
who might use pitch in a different

316
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,279
way yeah I've heard there's like people

317
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,160
who like make incredible music but they

318
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:31,639
don't even know music theory at all it's

319
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:35,639
just like yeah know that yeah totally uh

320
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:40,199
there's a big um big area now of study

321
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:43,839
on um implied cognitions of music theory

322
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:46,360
that um the idea being for for some of

323
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,959
the people who are working on this um

324
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,560
that nobody who's making absolutely

325
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,120
amazing music um has no conception of

326
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,319
what they're doing they might not have

327
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,519
the vocabulary to share it with us but

328
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,720
there's some sort of underlying

329
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,839
conception and how do we get at that um

330
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,759
one of my colleagues one of your uh

331
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,519
fellow professors you can take a class

332
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,480
with Leslie Tilly uh who teaches rhythms

333
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,160
of the world and the Bolognese gamon uh

334
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,279
Sor and music of Bali and Indonesia

335
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,959
things she just uh wrote a book that won

336
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:21,000
um that just won the big big award in

337
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,959
music theory which was on trying to

338
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,800
figure out what the conception of

339
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:29,199
Bolognese musicians who play these two

340
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,199
people who play these improvised drum

341
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,519
patterns interlocking at huge super

342
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,319
super fast intervals but sometimes they

343
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,079
one of them stops a bit and does the

344
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:40,720
other one and they you almost almost

345
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,720
never miss and when they do you know

346
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,560
just like a flub note they you know they

347
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,800
laugh and say oh oh how do how do we it

348
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,800
up but you know they say and um her book

349
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,399
begins with asking people how do you how

350
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,639
do you do this and said oh you just play

351
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,959
whatever you want and so of course she

352
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,399
plays no no no not that not and so how

353
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,000
do you get at the implied uh the implied

354
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,039
music theory conceptions super great uh

355
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,319
question Jordan I keep saying uh who are

356
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:11,120
the people who do this but some people

357
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,760
uh some people in this class identified

358
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,959
um stakeholders that weren't

359
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,000
people one yeah go ahead like do did

360
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,439
digital audio workstations yeah yeah so

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,799
we we can give autonomy to a digital

362
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,400
audio workstation or to a computer in

363
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,760
general or to uh a neural network um

364
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,480
there's been a a lot of talk about

365
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,120
autonomy and sentience in neuron

366
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,880
networks this week um and

367
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,880
uh and you know so so why not talk about

368
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,440
them as stakeholders what makes it

369
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,160
easier for a digital audio workstation

370
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,960
to process pitch probably usually uh

371
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,960
eliminate enharmonic

372
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,880
spelling helps quite a bit um yeah great

373
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,080
uh anything else that came up that that

374
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,159
you found especially if you if you read

375
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,120
something and even you don't remember

376
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,840
who it was but somebody else's that you

377
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,679
read and and liked and you thought oh I

378
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,679
wish I had thought of

379
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,120
that ah I'll I'll see it when we go

380
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,799
through the the sheets and stuff so so

381
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,440
that's that's great that's um mostly

382
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,600
leaving aside topic one now there's one

383
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,000
more thing in topic one and I've put it

384
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,760
on a video to watch this weekend you

385
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,760
will have unlocked your first music 21

386
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,720
module so now in any problem set from

387
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:41,159
now on it is will be fair game to say

388
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,159
from music

389
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,159
21

390
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,760
import

391
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,520
pitch and the video will go into more

392
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,240
detail from this pitch is lowercase in

393
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,320
Python what's that

394
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,760
signify if you're importing science

395
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,480
lowercase probably

396
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,000
well actually well okay there's a

397
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,760
there's a there's a pitch. capital pitch

398
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,880
what what's the distinction between

399
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,919
those

400
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,039
two in this

401
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:18,280
case yeah one is like a class one is a

402
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,280
class and the other one is a

403
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,520
what a

404
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,400
folder it acts exactly like a folder

405
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,480
great answer there's specific name that

406
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,320
that's used in yeah Jason mod module yep

407
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,080
so which one's

408
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,480
which that one's a class that one's a

409
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,200
class I'm I'm I'm very bad at I turn

410
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:43,520
around and you're Point capital P is a

411
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,240
class and lowercase one is the module so

412
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,880
you have everything

413
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,960
module module y everything that's in the

414
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,080
pitch module is done because you will

415
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,440
also find in there things like

416
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,240
accidental which is pretty helpful so a

417
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,559
module group together a related set of

418
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,799
classes if you yeah sorry just going

419
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,320
back to the umentation thing I was

420
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,120
wondering if there are any studies on

421
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,000
people who don't have perfect pitch but

422
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,760
only Val pitch like take the same piece

423
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,360
of music and then just transcribe it is

424
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,000
there any emotional difference like to

425
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,880
the doesn't matter if it's like you know

426
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
starting on D or starting on F some

427
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,960
doesn't have who doesn't have perfect

428
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,320
pitch uh I'll have to look that up I

429
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,760
imagine I mean uh the I don't have

430
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,039
perfect pitch but uh absolute pitches is

431
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,960
the term that we're using more often now

432
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,280
uh I don't have perfect or absolute

433
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,000
pitch but um but there's definitely

434
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,200
pieces that if you play you know some

435
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,880
song that I know really well and you

436
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,320
play it up a half step or up a whole

437
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,480
step it's going to you impact me now if

438
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,320
it's a song I don't know I'm not not

439
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,880
entirely sure but I'll I'll I'll see um

440
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:00,440
let me just make make a note on that um

441
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:04,280
I found in one one unscientific study

442
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,840
did that um in uh for a paper I was

443
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:11,840
working on that there's a particular

444
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:16,080
case where um you can uh very strangely

445
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,799
the rep the number of notes within a

446
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,960
repetition of Contour is decreasing but

447
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:25,440
the number of um repetitions of that

448
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,480
Contour before something changes is

449
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,120
increasing so the tempo depending on if

450
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,120
you hear

451
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,360
the harmony or the when the harmony

452
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,679
changes the harmonic changes as

453
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,679
determinant of tempo or if you hear the

454
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,960
repetition of Contour as determinant of

455
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,200
tempo you can hear the same piece

456
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,320
speeding up or slowing down and um a lot

457
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,760
of people were like oh yeah I I hear

458
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,559
this and things but um in that uh

459
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,960
unscientific experiment people with

460
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:57,720
absolute pit um

461
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,679
said I don't hear repetition of Contour

462
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,960
when the notes are different

463
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,279
that that doesn't seem to me a kind of

464
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,799
repetition so there's there probably

465
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,520
different ways we can do that great

466
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,360
super great question um we'll put that

467
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,960
aside when we edit it we'll edit that

468
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,000
about 10 seconds back and we'll jump

469
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,480
back to here just for a second U don't

470
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,520
don't be afraid of of of doing that if

471
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,679
if it's something you know and if if

472
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,480
it's something that I think it's going

473
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,320
to be super confusing to everybody if we

474
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,240
jump back I'll say we'll hold that for a

475
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,559
bit but I think we we can still code

476
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,159
switch which we can switch back and

477
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,679
forth between what we were talking about

478
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,840
30 seconds earlier and what we were just

479
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,120
talking about right good okay so you're

480
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,039
going to be able to import and use

481
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,320
anything in the pitch module as long as

482
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:48,720
it doesn't have the word

483
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,480
transpose in it somewhere because

484
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,320
certain kinds of transposition will be

485
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,880
uh things for us to work out in the next

486
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,080
couple problem sets good good so that's

487
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,520
that's what's coming up and then we'll

488
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,640
be done with with

489
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,799
that now uh so last class we were

490
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,039
talking a lot more about moving from the

491
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,640
representation of individual pitches

492
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,000
individual notes into larger things we

493
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,440
might call it representation of a score

494
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,080
or simply representation of Music

495
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,080
something of that sort I introduced a

496
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,200
term that some of you already knew from

497
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:29,440
other classes uh that come goes back to

498
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:34,279
uh philosophy but has a inter Twist of a

499
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,960
meaning in um in computer science anyone

500
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:41,400
remember that term without looking down

501
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,400
at the outline ony ontology

502
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,120
good and last class we explored um some

503
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,200
of the things in the Phil philosophical

504
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,760
thing definition of essence of of what

505
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,159
something is I remember some of the

506
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,559
things that we we had trouble defining

507
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,440
when something ended and became

508
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,720
something

509
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,320
else yeah we talked about notes we

510
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,320
talked about notes that we can't really

511
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,799
tell is is this one note is this two

512
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,760
notes is this six notes is it Infinity

513
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:19,080
of notes or 14 or um yeah then a larger

514
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,039
system um of musical notation remember

515
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,559
we called it used in used in uh one part

516
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,679
of the

517
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,600
world yeah common western music common

518
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,760
western music notation yeah and we had

519
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,159
we had some trouble distinguishing when

520
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,240
what was common or what was Western

521
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,640
about it or I suppose in one case what

522
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,559
was music about it uh seemed to be um

523
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,399
you know uh on the edge good then we

524
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,200
also brought up a little bit the

525
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:48,840
computer science

526
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,080
definition and that's what we're going

527
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,559
to be working looking at a little bit

528
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,399
now but always feeling like we want to

529
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:57,200
jump back to the philosophical

530
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:00,159
definition because we don't want ideas

531
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,640
from computer science all always to um

532
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,559
what what is easy to conceive of we

533
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,960
don't want that to limit our imagination

534
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,640
of what we might be able to conceive in

535
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,520
the

536
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,919
future so we talked about uh so in the

537
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,440
computer science definitions uh there

538
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,080
are various ones there's ones that are

539
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,080
more formalized there's ones that are

540
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,039
less one that I can't of keep in my head

541
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,640
because I can remember it when I come uh

542
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,320
come up is when we're trying to

543
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,320
represent something like music or you

544
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,720
know you can be your ontology of um of a

545
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,039
website or something but when you're

546
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,720
trying to think of a particular object

547
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,600
that's either conceptual or or you know

548
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,120
rified uh really real want to think

549
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,279
about how is it made up of what objects

550
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,760
are in

551
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,760
it what are the

552
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,240
relationships

553
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,000
ships between

554
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,559
objects and what are they called or what

555
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,760
are their names

556
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,360
what was it there was something it was

557
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,799
like first or second class that we had a

558
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,240
real oh I remember now really hard time

559
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,240
figuring out the name of it and it had

560
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,520
to do with the well this is a this is a

561
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,799
eighth note and this one's a whole note

562
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,679
and so the blank of the note is eighth

563
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,120
the blank of the note is whole what what

564
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,080
did we what did we come up with we had

565
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,720
some the Almond of it yeah we we had the

566
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,320
um so sometimes sometimes pushing it way

567
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,559
out there can make that um I mean some

568
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,960
of you all have taken physics you know

569
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,000
that uh probably subatomic particles do

570
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,200
not have a charm a color uh things like

571
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,720
that but these kinds of names can help

572
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,320
us conceive of some property of

573
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,559
something so we might have the Almond of

574
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,720
a note I think I went with something

575
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,320
very generic the type of the note but uh

576
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,919
always avoid type if you can come up

577
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,399
with something better because a type

578
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,039
it's it's too valuable to use if you can

579
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,640
and too generic so good so what are

580
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,919
things and what are they called and I'm

581
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,080
spending notice what are the objects

582
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:05,480
you're going to be thinking about that a

583
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,799
lot what are the relationships what

584
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,600
you're always going to be thinking about

585
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,640
that a lot but the name of something can

586
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,320
really really help somebody un somebody

587
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,240
else understand how you're conceiving

588
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,200
something and it's can be very very hard

589
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,559
U some of you have probably heard the

590
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,440
computer science joke that there's only

591
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,320
three really difficult things in

592
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,880
programming what to name something and

593
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,880
off by one

594
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,279
errors good good good some people hadn't

595
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,679
heard that and some other people have

596
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:43,799
yeah so what is something called and um

597
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:46,080
and that but we're going to jump now to

598
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:49,200
what are the relationships between

599
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,039
objects um what are some things in music

600
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,120
that we might consider an object let's

601
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:58,200
just let's let's rapid fire just shout

602
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,480
out over each other note note good

603
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,399
always take the easy one get the easy

604
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,360
participation credit great rest rest I

605
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,919
heard yep me measure oo that's good

606
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,440
phrase phrase

607
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,200
ah

608
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,159
good articulate Artic

609
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,440
articulation good let's I'm going to

610
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,320
stop writing down unless I hear

611
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,480
something that I've never never thought

612
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,200
of and um good what else

613
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,799
there Cliff Cliff good the whole score

614
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,559
the whole score good the score

615
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,880
the

616
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:35,200
dynamic the instrument

617
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,279
Tempo name of the

618
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,399
performer Concert Hall that was P

619
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,919
performed in maybe maybe not we can we

620
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,519
can kind of go but these are things we

621
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,279
might represent when we're thinking

622
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,880
about a performance of a music um good

623
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,679
anything else on people's jumping on

624
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,480
people's mind Angelica do you have one

625
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,279
that you haven't

626
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,679
heard beat or something beet oh yeah

627
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,960
beat

628
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,880
see that that's great because that's

629
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,320
something we don't see on the score but

630
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,840
we're thinking all the time right yeah

631
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,320
tamber good the instrumental

632
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,279
color

633
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,120
tamber great so so these are all

634
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,120
different things and um that might we

635
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,960
might think of as as objects one of the

636
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,519
things and some of them we might not

637
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,399
represent in every programming language

638
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,919
as an actual you know object class

639
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,200
depending on your programming language

640
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:33,919
but you know there things we can think

641
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,320
of that have a

642
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,679
particular um

643
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,880
nness can you say nness that they act

644
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,960
like nouns that they have the essence of

645
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,159
a noun um as opposed to a verb nobody

646
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,760
said that a fundamental object was

647
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,760
transpose or

648
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,720
perform right that that those those

649
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,080
verby things so when we want to think of

650
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:04,279
various ways that objects can be related

651
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,360
as any um we talk often about taxonomies

652
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,880
and

653
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,919
momies any has this come up in anybody

654
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,200
else's in computer science classes think

655
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,880
doesn't come up in was it 69

656
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,640
6101 okay good who has but who has heard

657
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,559
of a taxonomy in another concept yeah

658
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,399
yeah K what where have you heard it um

659
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,000
like animals animals Kings play cards on

660
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,200
fat green stools do they still teach

661
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,320
that or uh Kingdom film yeah I mean now

662
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,279
there's all these they keep rearranging

663
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,519
it right they're keeping sub classes and

664
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:39,360
super kingdoms and and things like that

665
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:44,440
but yeah so we can have a taxonomy that

666
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:49,039
way so taxonomy is one that we're um

667
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:52,240
we're useful for text on I

668
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,919
can when you're too close it's hard okay

669
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,080
taxonomy um in this definition in

670
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:01,399
ontology it's something is

671
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:07,919
something

672
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:12,600
else so um give the example here that

673
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:15,480
um that a a minuette is a

674
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,480
dance um for those who know the minuette

675
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,440
style in the early 18th century the

676
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:25,559
minuette is a triple time dance which

677
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,080
means it is a dance um or it is a um or

678
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,600
that I don't know what's what's

679
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,039
something else in in music that is

680
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,039
something

681
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:48,200
else yeah aletto is a Tempo aletto is a

682
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,720
Tempo working good I put up this what

683
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,960
what do you call this one in this

684
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,760
context Stato Stato now now you'll

685
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,760
understand when when we do Optical music

686
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,919
recognition how the context is so

687
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,200
important otherwise you'd say

688
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,880
augmentation dot right so staccato is a

689
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:10,639
articul articulation good is there any

690
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,639
higher level thing that we might say it

691
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,559
is musicians probably not but when we're

692
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,480
thinking of representing for computer

693
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,799
yeah John a half note is a note a half

694
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:26,399
note is a note good half note is a

695
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:29,399
note great uh I was just going to go

696
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,399
back to the articulations also but we'll

697
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,760
jump to half note is a note in a second

698
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:37,000
because that's a pretty fundamental one

699
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,240
um sometimes with with your own

700
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,240
representations you might think of um

701
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,320
for

702
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,320
instance is Trill an

703
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:55,360
articulation who votes yes who votes

704
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,000
no who votes I I have never thought

705
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,960
about this and I hope I never have to

706
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,519
think about this again in my life okay

707
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:09,559
good A lot of people call a tra an

708
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,880
ornament a turn an ornament something

709
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,240
like that so you might need what is the

710
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,480
class of but but we know that a Trill is

711
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:24,039
more related to an accent mark than it

712
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:26,399
is to a half note or to um a jaizelle

713
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:28,519
right so so we might think of what's

714
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,840
some some kind of slight just like some

715
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:35,399
kind of slightly bigger thing that holds

716
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,559
um that holds articulations and

717
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,519
ornaments what might we call that and

718
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,600
when we come up with a name for that

719
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,960
yeah Jason first then modifier a

720
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,960
modifier good that's what a lot of

721
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,159
people um that's believe what it's

722
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,399
called in the um Vex flow notation

723
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,159
software so somebody yeah I think maybe

724
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:57,000
you could kind of throw under envelope

725
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,600
if you're thinking about synthesis

726
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,120
envelope they

727
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,120
on are they

728
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,119
envelopes they might

729
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:12,520
be envelope envelope Changers envelope

730
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,639
there they in themselves the staccato

731
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,800
doesn't does the stado have an envelope

732
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,800
maybe it does I'm not I don't work in

733
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,679
this as much but it's like it's just

734
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,399
they attack

735
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:29,079
the the second thing

736
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:33,639
sustain uh attack no attack d k s

737
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:35,440
sustain r residen or release yeah not

738
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,480
this class not not what we're talking

739
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,200
about but some people have that

740
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,679
Knowledge from doing electronic music

741
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,720
things yeah so that so this is something

742
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,639
that changes how we attack how we Decay

743
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:49,040
how we sustain how we release right so

744
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,599
so yeah maybe that that is a very good

745
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,639
term we're going to be coming up with a

746
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,760
B bunch of these conceptual grouping

747
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:03,000
things because of um of something that

748
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:07,079
you can do with

749
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,079
um with uh with things that are in a

750
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,079
taxonomic

751
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,680
relationship and I'll write that out and

752
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,440
and while while you all think what might

753
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,040
be in those missing letters uh had a had

754
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,000
a question had a comment on the previous

755
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,320
one I say like augmentation there there

756
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
might be an augmentation or in the case

757
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,040
of a staccato Maybe a negative

758
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,839
augmentation or something yeah a length

759
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,839
reducer

760
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,040
good what do you think the that in

761
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,520
computer speak when we say that

762
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,280
something is something else we can

763
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,280
represent it

764
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,960
with subclass relationships who uh

765
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:55,119
subclasses is something that comes up

766
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,680
I'm 99% sure in the prere for this right

767
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,760
you guys deal with classes and subass

768
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,119
classes and things so um quite often

769
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,920
there there a bunch of builtin sub

770
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,720
classes in um in Python that you have

771
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,079
various um a lot of things are uh that

772
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,760
we think of things are subclasses of

773
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,200
number complex numbers oh yeah we all

774
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:24,400
learned uh taxonomies in in our math

775
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,400
classes too right complex numbers

776
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,839
floats ins

777
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,240
things like that and quite often for

778
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:34,280
different purposes that's why we thought

779
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,800
about stakeholders for different

780
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,839
purposes different um different sort of

781
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,400
taxonomies can be created right I mean

782
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:47,000
in certain case you could think um well

783
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,720
in integer is a special kind of float

784
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,040
that has nothing past the

785
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,880
dot and that's a very great mathematical

786
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,160
way of thinking of an integer if you try

787
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,200
to implement it that way in your

788
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,359
computer

789
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,240
programs you got some slowness going

790
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,400
because you have a whole bunch of added

791
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,520
baggage that you wouldn't need or you

792
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,640
could think of if you are uh I don't

793
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,000
know if you're when you're in third

794
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,920
grade fourth grade when's the first time

795
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,119
we learn about decimals we don't know

796
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,000
the word in but we know that there are

797
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,680
integers we know that there's five and

798
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,359
seven and things and the first time that

799
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,000
you see

800
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:29,119
5.2 you would think oh well this seems

801
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,720
to be a subass of this because it's a

802
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,040
different kind of number so depending on

803
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,480
how our ontology how we're

804
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,480
conceptualizing the world taxonomies

805
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,119
could run in two different

806
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,720
directions so let's um well we'll get

807
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,640
back to I just want to make sure that we

808
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,800
can get through this a certain amount of

809
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,880
time

810
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,960
um then there's something

811
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,560
called what did I write it down did I

812
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,560
not write it Y no something called a

813
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,560
momy

814
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:08,160
an

815
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:11,720
aeronomy something that instead of is

816
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,720
it's something that something

817
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,599
has um Michael CER is a human most of

818
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,720
the time and therefore he is an animal

819
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:28,000
because all humans are animals therefore

820
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,079
he is a living thing or that is because

821
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,720
that we can think of that as a

822
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,079
taxonomy uh Michael is an arm he's

823
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,040
actually two arms and he's also two legs

824
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,960
no that doesn't make sense there's a

825
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,880
relationship between my arms and my legs

826
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,359
and me but it's not the is relationship

827
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,599
or at least not the way I conceive of it

828
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:52,000
but it's something that I

829
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,560
have so what is something uh oh sorry I

830
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,079
meant to leave up John's great um half

831
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,880
note is a note thing so a half note is a

832
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,880
note what is something that a half note

833
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:10,040
has that it is

834
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:14,680
not uh Jason first almond almond it has

835
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:17,480
almond which we used for the type right

836
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,319
that's the Almond great I'm going to I

837
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,319
already have chives as a vocabulary

838
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:26,480
later now we have almonds so it has a

839
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:29,359
particular type great what else does a

840
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,359
half note

841
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:38,760
have duration duration good might have a

842
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:42,720
duration um what does an eighth note

843
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,720
have that a half note

844
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,560
lacks flag

845
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,520
flag call that a

846
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:56,200
flag and what might two eighth notes

847
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:59,440
have that um one eighth note doesn't and

848
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:03,160
yeah uh bar or what do we call that

849
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,800
thing beam good good I'm gonna the

850
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,839
center of the room has been really

851
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,839
active I'm going to focus over here and

852
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,440
over here for a little bit for the next

853
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,880
couple answers good so it has a beam so

854
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,520
we can think of this um and here's where

855
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,359
your conceptions go uh eighth note has a

856
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:25,440
beam um 16th Note have a beam or 16th

857
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:29,160
notes have a beam yeah do they have do

858
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:34,000
16th notes have a beam that has two

859
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,000
lines in it or do 16th notes have two

860
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,880
beams you can imagine you're going to

861
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,160
encode this very

862
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,000
differently if you encode number of

863
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,920
things and some eighth notes don't have

864
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
beams they have Flags instead um but

865
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,760
they have the potential for gaining a

866
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,400
beam perhaps if we think of um you know

867
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,520
Mommy I always want to grow up and be a

868
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,160
beamed uh eighth note not not a not a

869
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:04,000
flaged eighth note so you might you

870
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,160
might say well we're not going to have

871
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,240
um certain eighth notes that have no uh

872
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,000
now now we get to computer speak rather

873
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,800
than philosophy speak that have no

874
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,960
attribute that where a beam could go

875
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,240
because that's just silly I don't want

876
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,839
to have unbe eighth notes and beamed

877
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,800
eighth notes maybe as two different

878
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,040
concepts as two different objects maybe

879
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,599
you say well I'll have one type of

880
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,520
eighth note and it has either has or

881
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,560
doesn't have

882
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,800
beams then in your representation you

883
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,319
might be asking yourself oops leave that

884
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,000
up you might be asking yourself does it

885
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,920
make sense to say that eighth notes 16th

886
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,480
notes 32nd notes 64th notes whatever go

887
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,319
on to the highest power of two you can

888
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:53,680
think of have beams but quarter notes

889
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:57,480
and half notes and whole notes

890
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:00,079
don't or do we say that whole notes

891
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,280
notes have the potential to have beams

892
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,839
but we you better not put any

893
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,319
on I don't know there isn't a correct

894
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,480
answer for that and so sometimes what we

895
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:15,400
conceive of we I cannot conceive of a

896
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,720
whole note with Beams I I can conceive

897
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,079
of a half note with beams but um you

898
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,920
know I can think of it I don't know what

899
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,160
it

900
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,400
means actually it means I tremolos D but

901
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,079
but for but that's something else that's

902
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,119
something maybe that's playing visually

903
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,880
that looks just like a beam but means

904
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,599
something or maybe it's

905
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,599
not um so some of the things that come

906
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:39,839
up in music musical forms give so a

907
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,920
Sonata is a type of musical form it's

908
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,880
used quite often in the 18th and 19th

909
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,440
century um and it's a musical form that

910
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,280
has an exposition the thing close to the

911
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,480
beginning and the exposition has a first

912
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,559
theme group and a second theme group and

913
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,640
the First theme group has a phrase and

914
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,559
that phrase

915
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,079
has measures and those measures have

916
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,880
notes perhaps is one way of conceiving

917
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,520
it it would make much less sense to say

918
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,240
um well it has a phrase and a phrase is

919
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,960
a measure and a measure is a

920
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,440
note right

921
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,760
so this is going to be part of your um

922
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,319
the big part of problem set to in fact

923
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,520
uh we're going to skip um some other uh

924
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:27,839
things we're just going to do a little

925
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,319
bit of the the cook discussion um and

926
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,680
then um then I want to give you time to

927
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,440
start thinking about problem set two uh

928
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:38,960
in problem set two you're going to think

929
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,319
of a type of music that is not common

930
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,880
western music notation might not even

931
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:48,640
have to be a type of music some people

932
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,599
have done um have done things related to

933
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,160
music such as there was a chess playing

934
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,680
music generating system in the 1960s

935
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,880
that somebody uh decided to work on or

936
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,839
it might be the the structure of a

937
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,480
concert or something like that and I

938
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:07,400
want you to come up with the kinds of

939
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,960
what's the taxonomy in the ontology in

940
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,280
the in the conception of the system how

941
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,400
does this work and what is what are

942
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,960
these relationships what's the meton uh

943
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,520
morony and the taxonomy there over the

944
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,040
weekend we're going to be going

945
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,680
through some of the past notational

946
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,079
formats for

947
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,880
um western music notation for common

948
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,640
western music notation some of the

949
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:38,559
representations the ontologies the file

950
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,640
formats that um that have sort of come

951
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,760
up over time um one of the things a lot

952
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,319
of the pieces the discussions that

953
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,079
people were talking about have some

954
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,520
connection to Common western music

955
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,400
notation things I was hearing but are

956
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,960
not themselves common western music

957
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,800
notation right they they might have you

958
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,160
know oh yeah well well the rhythm is the

959
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,040
same as you know but as common western

960
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,800
music notation but something else

961
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,839
anything that you think um is just part

962
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,200
of common western music notation assume

963
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,800
that part of the um of the rep of the

964
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,160
ontology of the file format has already

965
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,040
been solved so you know what saying if

966
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,800
it's sort of like you're doing something

967
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,440
with oh this is a dance Groove and

968
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,559
here's and the Baseline is stored this

969
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,359
way it's it's represented in this way

970
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,480
and the notes of the Baseline are just

971
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:31,160
put stored in you know C CW

972
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,079
um MN or something and or stored somehow

973
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,960
stored in music XML stored something

974
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:38,400
you'll you'll get some formats and but

975
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,880
don't uh the only the only way that

976
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,480
people have uh Gone really wrong on on

977
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,000
similar assignments to this in the past

978
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,760
is spending too much time thinking about

979
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,079
the things that have already been solved

980
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,720
if you need to your format needs to

981
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:57,200
encode in images at certain points just

982
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,680
say the jpegs don't invent your entire

983
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,200
New Image format don't invent a new you

984
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,200
know things things that you already know

985
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,760
that's have spend your time on

986
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,920
conceptualizing what hasn't been

987
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,880
conceived

988
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,960
before um I just want to uh point out a

989
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,880
little bit oh sorry that is completely

990
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,319
illegible always feel free to tell me

991
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,400
when something is completely illegible

992
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,920
is that there we go now it's not um

993
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,240
we're going to go through this more

994
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,960
slowly uh I think I I can um can't

995
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,680
remember over the weekend or on

996
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,000
Wednesday um I should have my syllabus

997
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,720
in my head but I write it down so I

998
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,680
don't have to memorize it um but we're

999
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,920
going to be going through something

1000
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,800
called the Rosetta Stone of digital

1001
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,640
music representations uh by a really

1002
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,839
really smart guy uh Craig sap who

1003
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:49,319
realized um anybody seen uh know what

1004
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:51,720
the Rosetta Stone is it was the same

1005
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:55,359
text written in three different

1006
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,920
languages uh in especially in Greek and

1007
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:00,960
in ancient um

1008
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,559
hieroglyphics that allowed hieroglyphics

1009
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,280
to finally be um finally be decoded

1010
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,960
Craig saps Rosetta Stone takes the exact

1011
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,240
same little

1012
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,330
Melody I can go

1013
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:20,720
over what is it

1014
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:23,240
[Music]

1015
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,359
um my rhythm was pretty bad on that

1016
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,559
should um but that exact same Melody and

1017
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:31,760
shows

1018
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:34,880
how that Melody is encoded in I think he

1019
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,559
has like 32 on his website I have edited

1020
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,280
it down to about eight but so that you

1021
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,319
can see what different representational

1022
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,680
choices people have made and what kinds

1023
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:49,440
of ontologies they make um for instance

1024
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:53,359
I remember in this case

1025
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,839
beams are high L things they are

1026
00:47:53,359 --> 00:48:00,640
represented by these braces and so

1027
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:04,520
therefore they they enclose things beams

1028
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,640
in this case seem to have um a morony

1029
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:10,040
that beams have

1030
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,280
notes not notes have beams so we'll try

1031
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,640
to see some of these things it's another

1032
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,240
format uh called ABC one of the ones

1033
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,839
still in use even though uh quite a bit

1034
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:23,920
old because it's very very simple we'll

1035
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:26,319
be looking at these in more detail

1036
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,240
various formats that at some point were

1037
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:32,720
very big B um but have mostly faded this

1038
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:36,000
is one that we saw once before M's data

1039
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,359
where um the Q was quarter and the eight

1040
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,079
um was a certain number of durations and

1041
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:45,079
F5 do you remember that from class or

1042
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:50,079
two ago yep and we'll see over

1043
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:51,359
time how the formats have gotten to be a

1044
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,960
little bit

1045
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,480
more

1046
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,319
complex here we

1047
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,640
go this is music XML which we're going

1048
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:04,359
to be talking about quite a bit of

1049
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:09,200
course uh invented by Alum of MIT

1050
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:12,680
Michael good and um and one of the great

1051
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,440
formats for representing music notation

1052
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,280
uh the first one with enharmonics that

1053
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,280
just was taken and used by almost

1054
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:25,079
everybody's about 20 22 years old a lot

1055
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:26,960
of us thought this is the final format

1056
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:28,760
this is the representation that really

1057
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,960
really works even if there's some weird

1058
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,880
quirks we use it forever and then a

1059
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,680
terrible thing started happening to

1060
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:40,200
music a great and terrible thing started

1061
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:44,760
happening to music about uh 10 years ago

1062
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:47,799
12 almost 15 years ago but um we started

1063
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:52,000
looking at music sheet music on various

1064
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:54,839
sized screens and therefore where it's

1065
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,559
too the screen is too small to look at a

1066
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:59,480
whole page at the time or or you turn it

1067
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:02,440
sideways and suddenly your page has

1068
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,960
changed so the notion that music cannot

1069
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,079
just be represented by where is on a

1070
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,599
page but has to be able to keep

1071
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:13,440
continuously reflowing has caused um a

1072
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:16,760
big change to people today trying to

1073
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,720
come up with what is the optimal format

1074
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,920
for representing music whose

1075
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,720
presentation might be different for you

1076
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,400
because you have an iPad it might be

1077
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,880
different over here because you have a

1078
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,839
15in um Monitor and it might be

1079
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,359
different for somebody else because

1080
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,400
you've just printed it out in the

1081
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,440
oldfashioned way how do we represent

1082
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:38,319
music that way I wanted to point out

1083
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,880
because um there is a huge debate so

1084
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:44,599
there's a big discussion happening right

1085
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,480
now on what the music notation next

1086
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:51,960
format will be and exactly how it will

1087
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,040
what its ontology and morony will be so

1088
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:57,359
that it survives into the next

1089
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,680
generation of musical School course and

1090
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:05,280
people you can see are still right now

1091
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:08,680
um some idiots sometimes post but um and

1092
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,160
um and exactly what kind of format uh

1093
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,559
what the advantages in terms of space

1094
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,720
speed various representations are going

1095
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:18,640
