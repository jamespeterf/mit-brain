1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,839
And with that, I would now um like to

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,240
invite Chancellor Nobles to the stage.

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,520
Uh we're going to have a quick um

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,400
fireside chat. Uh there's no fire here,

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,400
but uh we'll make do. Uh please let me

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,359
pull this slightly to the center so that

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
>> Oh boy.

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
>> Yep.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,400
>> On the hot seat. hot seat. Yes.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,400
>> Morning everyone.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,239
>> So, um I thought or we thought that it

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,079
would be nice for uh Melissa to talk

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:48,000
about her um uh experience working with

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,360
students. Um she's been here doing this

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,079
for a while now. Um and so, you know,

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,480
all of us try to imagine what it is to

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
be a chancellor of a university, right?

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,960
So let's start with what does that job

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
actually entail at MIT because at every

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,720
university it may have a different

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,000
definition. Would love to understand

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
what it means at MIT.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,080
>> Sure. Thank you. Good morning everyone.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,600
So I've been at MIT for um over 30

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,560
years. I came as an assistant professor

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,240
in political science and um recently

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
within the past five years became

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,000
chancellor. Um so the chancellor is

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,280
responsible for all things connected to

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
students on both the living side meaning

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
uh the division of student life as well

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,119
as the academic side both graduate and

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,920
undergraduate studies and there is an

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,240
office of 60 beneath me um which work

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,280
with our students and of course with our

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,200
faculty um so the president the provos

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,720
deals with the faculty and I deal with

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,280
the students and the president deals

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,759
with everything.

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,479
Well, thank you. Uh 60 plus offices.

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,600
That's a that's a lot. Um but I did want

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,520
to ask about I'm sure you see MIT

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
students at their most vulnerable,

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
right? These are all smart students that

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
come to MIT. They have never failed in

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,600
their high school education. They've

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,240
been validictorians

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,640
and um yeah overachievers and then they

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,000
come to MIT and they fail for the first

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:14,000
time. Uh what how how do you deal with

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,360
that? I mean it's a small ego or a large

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,680
ego that gets pricricked.

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
>> Yes. Well, many of our students, it's

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
true. Absolutely. They've been high

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
achievers and they've been known to be

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,640
the best and then they come into a place

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,160
where everyone is doing well and and

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
because we don't grade, the faculty do

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
not grade on the curve. It it's quite

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,040
devastating for those who don't do as

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,120
well. Um, but we have a big support

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,519
system for them and let them know that

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
uh they were in, they're here for a

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040
reason and we're going to make sure that

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
they get out and succeed. So, we provide

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,760
lots of services and we let them know

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
you're going to fail, you'll survive,

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
you you we'll provide you supports that

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,120
you need and you'll do better. So, that

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,319
that helps, right? um they're smart as

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,959
you said, but they're 18, you know,

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,160
they're 18 years old and so we we always

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,920
want to make sure that we're supporting

74
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,239
them in the ways that they think best,

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,239
but it's not always easy, I must say.

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,080
>> Um and it often takes a lot of high

77
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
touch, which is what we provide as well.

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
We provide a lot of high touch for our

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,280
students, meaning we have a fairly flat

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,720
organization. Students send emails to

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
the president, her name is Sally, and

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,680
they say, "Hi, Sally." So, we don't have

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,200
President Corn Bluth. I'm Melissa and

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,400
the rest. So we we try to allow uh there

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,959
to be as much um connection between us

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
but uh obviously the president or I

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,280
don't deal with every single issue the

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,239
students have. We have a very um

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,879
elaborate uh support teams which u reach

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,480
out to our students as needed.

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,000
>> Yeah. So that means like depending on

92
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,680
the problems that they're facing they'll

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
go to one of the six%.

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,680
>> Yeah.

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,360
>> Exactly. Right. Um what's the most human

96
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,440
moment you've experienced with a student

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
that reminded you that they're not an

98
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,120
academic machine?

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
>> Well, usually and sometimes that can be

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,920
difficult. you know when I was teaching

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:06,879
um uh I was I the am ambitions and the

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,959
passions was something that um uh I I uh

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,560
I was surprised by pleasantly surprised

104
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,840
by that uh motivation was not a question

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
and I didn't have to work to motivate

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,479
anyone often times I think all the

107
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,440
faculty say students keep us on our toes

108
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,440
so uh so sometimes you we you know you

109
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,919
kind of forget that about them but what

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,520
made them what I would Oh, after class

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,080
they come and speak to me. They ask me

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,759
very personal things or things about

113
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,199
their lives or what they should do,

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,880
asking for guidance and things that

115
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
remind you that of course they're trying

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,080
to find their way even as they are

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,160
usually quite focused academically.

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,680
They often times recognize as we would

119
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
expect that they have fuller lives

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,800
beyond what's in the classroom.

121
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,600
>> Of course. Of course. Um

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,000
and I've heard you say the whole

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,400
student, right? What does that mean?

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,880
like what do you mean that I mean of

125
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,880
course we talk about academics they're

126
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,680
coming to MIT for academics but what is

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
a whole student

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,080
>> well oftentimes uh there's you know if

129
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,639
you say MIT most people say nerd right

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,759
they're like ah right I mean that's kind

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,280
of what people think and um and there's

132
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,280
some truth in that um but it's an

133
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,880
interesting nerd and it's a nerd that

134
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,400
just isn't about science technology

135
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
although that's a big part of it I was

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
the dean of the school of humanities

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,479
arts and social sciences before becoming

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,880
chancellor

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,680
And in that school we have music and

140
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,840
theater arts which is hugely popular,

141
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,199
poetry, creative writing, all of those

142
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
things. I mean just the what would you

143
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
expect the wide range of interest that

144
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,440
makes us human. Our students are no

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,000
different. Even if the public perception

146
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,639
is that they are not that way. So the

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
whole student means attending to their

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,800
intellectual interest giving them space

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
to think about those things. But

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
secondly, it's and as more importantly

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,360
actually is thinking about their person,

152
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
physical health, the human relationships

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
that they create, how to live in

154
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,960
community and dorms, all the things that

155
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,199
students deal with when you come when

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,639
you're on a residential campus, a quite

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,800
diverse residential campus and every

158
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,360
dimension of diversity and you're coming

159
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,000
to live and grow. So the whole student

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
means taking care of yourself and taking

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,319
care of your person outside of your

162
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,560
intellectual life. In our current moment

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,120
as the uh Steve was mentioning about the

164
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,440
concerns about technology emphasis on

165
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,919
the human part is even more important.

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,199
Um increasingly our students are coming

167
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,199
in with much more digital native in a

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
way that many of us were not. So of my

169
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
generation the life that I imagine being

170
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,600
a graduate uh undergraduate is not the

171
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,199
lives of our students. Social media is

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,639
there from the beginning. Oftentimes

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
when I'm in a meeting with the students

174
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,440
there are three people in the meeting.

175
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,600
me, the student in the phone. And the

176
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,520
phone has power. It's they're texting.

177
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,120
You think you you know you you're

178
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,960
dealing with uh a a technology that's

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
changing the way in which they interact

180
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,400
with me, in which they interact with

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,319
each other and themselves, right?

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
There's a there's the person sitting in

183
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,880
front of you. Then there's their profile

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,080
on Instagram. And there might not be a

185
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,560
lot of resemblance between the two. So

186
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,479
that's changing

187
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,880
>> the the world in which we're living and

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,800
it creates uh a different kind of

189
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,400
meaning to the notion of the whole

190
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
student. No, that's a very interesting

191
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,000
thing, right? I mean, uh, the student as

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,560
a person versus their online persona.

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,759
>> Yes.

194
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
>> Makes it the whole as well.

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,479
>> I mean, it would seem obvious, but when

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,400
we've talked to students, if you're

197
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,599
having a disagreement with someone, you

198
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
can just talk to them. You don't have to

199
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,080
put it a post, a tweet or whatever they

200
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,759
call it now, right? Part of my challenge

201
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,120
is keeping up with the nomenclature. But

202
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,479
anyway, um, whatever it is, you put it

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,039
out there and it creates um, it it can

204
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,400
complicate Yeah. relationships as much

205
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,000
as it can um advance them and there is a

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
way in which these social media help to

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,919
build community but you have to think

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,919
about it in a way that um you have to be

209
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,879
quite intentional about it because the

210
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,919
the uh the the downsides can be quite

211
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,160
extreme.

212
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,039
>> Well, thank you. I mean I hadn't thought

213
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
about the com and now with AI it gets

214
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
even more complicated.

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
>> Absolutely.

216
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
>> Um

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,720
>> absolutely

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,360
>> tough job. Um students today face

219
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,240
pressures um that like you mentioned

220
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,160
that our generation did not face. So um

221
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,759
can you explain what keeps you up at

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
night when you think about those new

223
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,440
challenges that we may not have faced

224
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,039
when we were younger?

225
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,360
>> You know um it's a that's a complicated

226
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,240
question. Um on the one hand many of our

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,040
students are uh the ones I meet are

228
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,800
quite earnest and optimistic about their

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
own futures. Yeah,

230
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,279
>> even if they despair about the world.

231
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,600
And I'm sure it seems kind of

232
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,279
counterintuitive or at least um

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
inreconcilable how you have those two

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,640
things happening. But you can think I'm

235
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,680
doing well, but many are deeply

236
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,279
concerned about climate change. So, and

237
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,040
kind of an existential concern. Some are

238
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,120
concerned or confused about how to think

239
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,959
about these technologies.

240
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,600
Uh the third is though they have great

241
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,200
faith in the ability of science

242
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
technologies to make differences. So

243
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,120
there's a there is a uh conflict of

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,760
sorts of of which I think is a different

245
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,440
kind of burden. Uh when I think about my

246
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,519
own life for all of the issues in the

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
United States when I was coming up I

248
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,120
thought that there was a um the

249
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
escalator was always going up but there

250
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
was a there was a certain confidence and

251
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,360
optimism about progress.

252
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
>> Yeah. as being inevitable and

253
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
unquestioned.

254
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
I don't think students see that that

255
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,839
this way. So, it's a challenging time

256
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,080
for our students in that regard.

257
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,320
>> Yeah. Thank you. Uh that's that's

258
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
something for all of us to think about.

259
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
Um

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,040
during your toughest moment as

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,320
chancellor, um

262
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,360
how did you balance being a leader

263
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,760
and being a human?

264
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,200
So it's often times and I imagine many

265
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,279
of you face these kind of issues. You

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
have a a hard decision or something that

267
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
you have to make some bad news that you

268
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,279
have to deliver but you have to do it in

269
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,279
such a way that leaves the person um

270
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,000
whole but decision stands

271
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,680
>> correct. Um

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,920
so usually it's basically um being quite

273
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,240
direct

274
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,480
maybe soften delivery but no ambiguity

275
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,440
um because ambiguity just complicates

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,560
something you know only makes it it yeah

277
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
it doesn't help. So I just always say,

278
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
you know, think about how I want

279
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
something told to me. Say it straight.

280
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
>> Yeah.

281
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,360
>> Respect me. Acknowledge that it will be

282
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,800
difficult for me to hear it, but say it

283
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,279
and then give me something to, you know,

284
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,440
take away with it, some optimism or

285
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
direction. So I try to do the same. I

286
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,600
think about students as I would want to

287
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,440
be talked to when I was that age. um um

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
even when people had to deliver bad news

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,399
to me and as when I was in college I

290
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,079
heard a lot of bad news so it was good

291
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,279
that I did.

292
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:29,040
>> No, thank you. Uh I I personally prefer

293
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,160
direct messaging uh respect but direct.

294
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,200
Um before you became chancellor, what

295
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,200
aspect of student life did you think you

296
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
understood but you were completely wrong

297
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,079
about it

298
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,320
or slightly wrong about it or did not

299
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,000
completely understand?

300
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,760
>> Well, I think so. I would just see them

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
in the classroom. I come in and we

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,200
teach, you know, I teach and things and

303
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,680
enjoy those conversations, meet with

304
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,720
students doing office hours and things.

305
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,519
I had no sense of life after they left

306
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,880
the classroom. I mean, none. um you know

307
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,760
where students were living. I knew they

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,519
lived on campus and things um but I

309
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
didn't have any sense of the depth of

310
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,320
the of their relationships just the

311
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,240
complexity of their lives. Um and now as

312
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,600
chancellor I see it much more in the

313
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,160
ways in which the institute is helping

314
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,079
to shape that the institute right um the

315
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,320
way in which it's helping to shape their

316
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,279
lives in ways that as a faculty member I

317
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,560
hadn't appreciated but um it's their

318
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,079
home for the four years that they're

319
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,120
there and um and it and so we have a

320
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,680
responsibility to make to make it as um

321
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
a you know responsibly provide a place

322
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,680
where they can thrive and we're all

323
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,680
committed to to that. No, and that's

324
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,399
where the whole student also comes in

325
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,720
into play. Um,

326
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
and of course the other the flip side is

327
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
also when students saw you as a

328
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,040
professor was different and now they see

329
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
you as administration.

330
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
So

331
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
>> yeah,

332
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,160
>> how do you break through that?

333
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,240
>> Faculty are revered

334
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,720
>> administration. Administration or not?

335
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,720
Um, so I'm admin. You admin

336
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,480
this true. I am admin. Um, one thing

337
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,399
that I do, um, I I try to make myself

338
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
available as possible. Unannounced

339
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
visits to different things with being

340
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,639
careful about

341
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,320
student spaces though because they do,

342
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,959
you know, if I come to unannounced,

343
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,079
they're like, really? So, I I I try to

344
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,560
go in places where I'm unexpected, but

345
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,360
um, where my presence would be welcomed.

346
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,000
see observing something going to back to

347
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,399
games you know uh different kind of

348
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
events I'll just show up uh that's one

349
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,760
thing the other thing I do quite

350
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,680
deliberately um and this is back to my

351
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,240
earlier remarks about it being a fairly

352
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,079
flat organization is that I have direct

353
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,040
um relationships with the leadership of

354
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,360
the student body so the undergraduate

355
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,079
>> association and the graduate student

356
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,480
council and they have my cell number I

357
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,399
have theirs and I meet with them every

358
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
two weeks privately one-on-one with

359
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,519
leadership so they get to know me and I

360
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,279
do this over the summer and we do this

361
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
during the year. So when things happen

362
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,480
and over the past three years or four

363
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,480
years it's been quite active on many

364
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,040
campuses in the US. those kind of

365
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,079
connections have helped quite a bit in a

366
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,160
range of issues and it just sets up com

367
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,399
you know personal conversations um so

368
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,199
that the admin they see how I see things

369
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,040
and I see how they see things and so it

370
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,240
makes our conversations we don't always

371
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,440
agree but at least we um we have a

372
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
relationship that makes those

373
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
conversations easy

374
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,600
>> easier

375
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,720
>> and to your point I mean it's not about

376
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,040
agreeing it's about being direct and um

377
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
compassionate at the same time. Yeah.

378
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,600
>> Um

379
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,639
>> I mean we talked about it. MIT attracts

380
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,519
the smartest kinds of uh students uh and

381
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,000
people in the room. Um what happens when

382
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,560
they realize that uh they're not smart

383
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,680
anymore or they're not the only smart

384
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,959
person in the room.

385
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,880
>> They just they either say uh they learn

386
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,320
from each other. I mean we have some MIT

387
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,959
alums here. I'm sure they can tell you

388
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,199
that um getting through MIT and and as

389
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,959
you can imagine most things is a is is

390
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,600
collaborative. It it you know in certain

391
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,360
ways the MIT experience is the first

392
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,680
step in learning how to work in

393
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,480
collaboration prepares you for the uh

394
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,240
workforce. You're dealing in labs. Um

395
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
some of our students have cons uh want

396
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,000
to be entrepreneurs. We've got all kinds

397
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,399
of programs to support entrepreneurship.

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,279
We have something known as sandbox where

399
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,959
students along with alumni um they

400
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,320
students pitch their ideas. they work

401
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,480
with alumni. Some of those things

402
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,880
succeed, some of them don't. But all of

403
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,560
those efforts are so in other words to

404
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,800
get better, you get better by working

405
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,800
with others, right? Um rather than

406
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,880
running away from it, you join teams,

407
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
create teams, learn from your peers. And

408
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,720
nearly all the students say upon

409
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,160
graduation, what got them through MIT

410
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,920
was working, finding their teams and and

411
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,519
that means creating their teams. Yeah.

412
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,759
Support teams, which allows them to

413
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,560
succeed. And that seems to me to be a

414
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,040
life lesson that um is pretty important

415
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,800
and and serves many of our students well

416
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,079
once they graduate.

417
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,639
>> You talked about many initiatives. Uh we

418
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,759
have about 200 plus initiatives for

419
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:19,240
entrepreneurs for students.

420
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,240
Anything that they want they have it. Um

421
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,600
uh the other question is you report to

422
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,199
the president right you work with

423
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,839
provost coordinate with VPs but again

424
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,320
this is coming back to you admin

425
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,079
>> students don't care what the admin

426
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,800
organization structure is right

427
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,360
>> correct

428
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,000
>> um or the org chart um how do you how do

429
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,079
you cut through that because you may not

430
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,279
be able to tell them that this is the

431
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,880
decision and this is not mine. This is

432
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,279
somebody else that has made the

433
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,079
decision. But how do you how do you tra

434
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,920
travel through those?

435
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,440
>> Usually anyone the student comes we send

436
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,440
them to the office where they need to

437
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
come because if it's coming to me the

438
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,199
president is because no one else can

439
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,000
solve it. Right. So the point is to push

440
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
it down.

441
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
>> Okay.

442
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,280
>> Be polite about it but you but also

443
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,640
people who are closer to it can are are

444
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,319
much better. Right. Exactly. So the

445
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
point of having some organizations is

446
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,919
that people do their jobs at the level

447
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,760
they have to do them.

448
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,799
>> So I have a couple lightning round

449
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,120
questions for you.

450
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,760
>> Sure.

451
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,079
>> Okay.

452
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,760
>> Yeah.

453
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:30,360
>> All right. Um complete this. Uh MIT

454
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,360
students will surprise you by

455
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,960
>> um they'll surprise you uh by their I

456
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,679
know this is going to sound like a kind

457
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,799
of can, but it's true. their earnestness

458
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,400
and their creativity. I'm always I you

459
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,559
know just I remember being I was

460
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,240
teaching a class and uh afterwards young

461
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,679
student said I I said can you come to my

462
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
office hours? He's like no. I was like

463
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
why? He was like because um I have my

464
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
company. I was like company. He was

465
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,480
running a company out of his dorm room.

466
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,480
I was like I was like he was a first

467
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,480
year.

468
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,679
I've had more that was one in particular

469
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,200
because I was so you know shocked. I was

470
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,679
like this could be a senior right? He

471
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,440
was like a first year student. So what

472
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,280
surprises me though is that they, you

473
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,720
know, just they're just interesting. You

474
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,760
know, they have their own interest that

475
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,360
each one is their own. You know, I'm I

476
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,600
grew up in New York City, part of my

477
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,679
life in New York City. And um part of

478
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,960
New York is like you do your own thing.

479
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,640
And when people ask me when I think

480
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
about MIT, it kind of reminds me of New

481
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,080
York. It's like just do your thing. Do

482
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,360
it well, but do your thing.

483
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,919
>> That's that's fascinating. Um, so, okay,

484
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,799
if you could install one thing in every

485
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,600
MIT student's brain, what would it be?

486
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:49,240
Um,

487
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,240
this uh,

488
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,799
you don't have to optimize everything.

489
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,919
Like everything's optimized. Not all

490
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,160
students, but many. I'm shocked. I'm

491
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,440
like, really? You optimize that, too? I

492
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,520
mean it's it's it's a it's a feeling of

493
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,640
optimization. Yeah. Yeah. I would say on

494
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,799
some things um

495
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,799
um

496
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,559
yeah just

497
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:20,799
take a little time to think to to to to

498
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,400
go um yeah think about the complex just

499
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,480
don't think about optimizing. I mean I

500
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,080
can't I

501
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,960
I would that's what I would ask him to

502
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
do.

503
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,640
>> So that picks another question. Does

504
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,039
that mean that the kinds of students

505
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,480
that we get are

506
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,000
uh a particular kind that

507
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
>> of course they're smart but are they

508
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
also

509
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,760
>> there's attention to it's an attention

510
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,679
to this is not a bad thing of course a

511
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,280
certain attention to detail and

512
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,200
organizing

513
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,559
and that has its strengths of course and

514
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,320
it certainly um and why in in asking

515
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,120
people to think differently about things

516
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,880
you come up against the question well um

517
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,240
if it's not fit if it's not broken,

518
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,720
don't fix it. Right? I mean, that would

519
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,520
be the response. And that's I understand

520
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,520
that response, but I guess my I often

521
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,240
say not everything can be prepared.

522
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,840
There is a certain value in serendipity

523
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
in an accident.

524
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,799
>> Yes.

525
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,039
>> And you don't always know, you know, you

526
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,200
may think I, you know, I if I take this

527
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,200
class, I do this person, I do, it's all

528
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,200
going to work. And and sometimes it

529
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,039
doesn't. Often it doesn't. And and so be

530
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
prepared for that. So there is a certain

531
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,679
amount of we use this term a lot

532
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,640
resiliency and it's used in we're using

533
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,320
it in our lives that is all of our lives

534
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,559
in different kinds of ways thinking

535
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,799
about our um uh the human condition uh

536
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,559
but in a very particular sense in the on

537
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,559
the campus in particular with MIT

538
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,440
students the resiliency comes from I

539
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,840
think being willing to deal with the

540
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,880
uncertainty that comes when your plans

541
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,600
go ary.

542
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,520
>> Yeah. And

543
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,440
I've seen that happen more than once. I

544
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,240
thought this and it was very well

545
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,320
thought out. You know, it was optimiz

546
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,799
but why do people, you know, act like

547
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,039
this? I would often hear I would often

548
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,039
have this uh this would come up quite a

549
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,760
bit in political science classes and

550
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,520
classes where uh we go through what

551
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,919
would appear to be the logic. This is

552
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,039
what the politician should do and this

553
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,559
is what the public should think. And of

554
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,159
course, this is what actually happens.

555
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,880
And Sue was like what happened? It was

556
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,440
like

557
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,559
>> life.

558
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,720
>> Yes. Humans or other motivations which

559
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,559
don't fit into whatever it is that as

560
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,000
you've as your your model of

561
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,320
optimization. So um so a certain amount

562
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,840
of resiliency but that that notion of of

563
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,799
of approaches to intellectual issues

564
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,720
oftentimes um also ends up being a part

565
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,240
of how you organize how they organize

566
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,240
their lives. Not all students, but of

567
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,440
course I'm speaking in generalities.

568
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,880
>> No, that's that's fair. Um um another

569
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,039
question uh what's the most MIT thing a

570
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,679
student has ever done that made you

571
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,240
think that uh Yep. This can only happen

572
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,880
at MIT. Oh, there are things I could say

573
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,880
but I probably shouldn't.

574
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:16,799
Um yeah, that's too revealing. But um I

575
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,320
guess I I I I guess the thing I would

576
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,559
say is a certain um

577
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,480
uh a certain willingness to take on a

578
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,640
really hard problem. Like we can solve

579
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
that. There's a lot of that like we can

580
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,640
solve that. A certain confidence that

581
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,520
you can actually solve really hard

582
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,400
problems in a way that isn't um isn't

583
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,960
put on. It's like earnest. Um that

584
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,600
surprises me. Is it like a naive or is

585
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
it

586
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,400
>> It's not really naive. It's thinking

587
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,520
that you figure out the problem

588
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,720
>> like you know it's going to be a hard

589
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,480
problem to figure out but you will what

590
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,919
do you mean you can't

591
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,840
>> okay

592
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,679
>> that surprises me. So it pushes you know

593
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,039
you you know pushes you you're like okay

594
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,240
maybe you're right.

595
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,080
>> Yeah

596
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,600
>> I you know that's a skill that if

597
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,600
students if you come in you don't lose

598
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,039
that confidence. It may be tempered of

599
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,559
course by reality and it will be

600
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,880
tempered by disappointments in the

601
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,400
Reich. But if you're able to maintain

602
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,880
that attitude and over the course of

603
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,880
your education develop the skills to

604
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,280
make it real or at least to give others

605
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,799
confidence that you can follow through.

606
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,039
That's a leadership. That's

607
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,400
entrepreneurship. That's the kind of

608
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,640
character that you would want students

609
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,559
to have. particularly people who you are

610
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,720
putting in positions of creating

611
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,679
technologies that will shape humankind

612
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,880
which as you show that's the way it is.

613
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,799
So you definitely want that even if you

614
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,440
know jaded adults or you know people

615
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,120
like myself okay but you don't want to

616
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,280
temper that too much life will do the

617
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,039
tempering but you'd rather have someone

618
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,480
have the confidence.

619
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,640
>> No I like that. Um

620
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,799
I know you said some of them are too

621
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,720
revealing examples. Are there any

622
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,600
examples that you may want to share?

623
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,240
>> No.

624
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,720
>> Okay, I'm not going to push you on that.

625
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,480
Um, with that, I I'm done with the

626
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,240
lightning round questions, but I did

627
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,400
want to ask one real question like um

628
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,400
forget about your official job

629
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,240
description.

630
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,679
What does this role actually mean to

631
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,360
you?

632
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,360
>> Right. So, I've been at MIT for 33

633
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,400
years. I've been there for a reason. I

634
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:30,400
really um I really uh respect my

635
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,919
colleagues and students and it's a

636
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,480
privilege to be the chancellor. um in

637
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:41,600
part because uh what it means for me is

638
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,120
to think that um I'm at a place uh I

639
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,000
believe in you know obviously I believe

640
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,400
in education all education even as it's

641
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,960
being challenged in our country high

642
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,240
education is still

643
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,480
uh uh you know the best path I would

644
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,960
argue for human advancement and there's

645
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,720
nothing as noble I think as creating

646
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,200
knowledge

647
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,600
and uh finding and dedicating it to

648
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
bettering the human condition. And so

649
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,760
for me as chancellor, what it means is

650
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,640
to be a part of that process in the way

651
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,559
that I hope is meaningful and which

652
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,640
supports an institution which I believe

653
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,120
in a great deal. So it's a great

654
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,159
privilege and I'm um and I'm happy to do

655
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,000
it and uh and I and I hope to make some

656
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,039
important contributions as I'm when I'm

657
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,840
chancellor.

658
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,240
>> Well, that's beautiful. Um

659
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,240
one last thing do you have any call to

660
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,360
action for the audience here? Yeah. So

661
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,960
I've been talking a lot about the

662
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,080
students and the point was to kind of

663
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,640
give you all a sense of what it you know

664
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,720
the people that MIT you know it's this

665
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,200
great engine but at the end of the day

666
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,039
the faculty the students and researchers

667
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
um many of us are here for the students

668
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,559
first right the students and then of

669
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,320
course the faculty and everyone else and

670
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,039
all of us are a very important part of

671
00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:01,360
the MIT ecosystem and our students um uh

672
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,960
we've got MIT Misti which is Misti UK

673
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,960
We've got actually we've got so Misti

674
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,679
this is the inter uh the uh

675
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,520
international scientific technology um

676
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,960
program initiative that we have to send

677
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,480
our students out into the world. We have

678
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,600
a pretty uh diverse student body both

679
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,039
internationally on both the

680
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,240
undergraduate especially on the graduate

681
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,600
level 40% of our graduate students are

682
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,000
um over 43% are international students

683
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,600
and our undergrads are similarly quite

684
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
diverse.

685
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,960
uh we want to send them out into the

686
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,679
world to get great experiences

687
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,240
um and a lot of them have uh internships

688
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,480
at different companies uh around the

689
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,000
world. Uh

690
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,320
encourage you to think about being a

691
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,720
part of Misti having our students come.

692
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,400
They mean the work. One thing about MIT,

693
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,559
we don't have very few a semester abroad

694
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,600
because the engineering and science and

695
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,520
all of our majors are such that you

696
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,440
can't really graduate in four years if

697
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,960
you take a semester off, right? And and

698
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,039
it's very difficult to get the credits

699
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,919
from other universities that the faculty

700
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,559
at MIT will accept. So typically

701
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,440
students are uh available in the summer

702
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,279
and during January.

703
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,919
They mean to work. They mean to learn.

704
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,279
They come to the to the the internships

705
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:23,120
are meant to be um educationally based.

706
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,840
Um and uh uh you know you get an early

707
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,159
look and a a chance to work with really

708
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,320
um interesting students, intelligent

709
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,640
students, motivated students and also

710
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,400
they get to learn. I mean so learning

711
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,640
goes in two directions. I've talked a

712
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,080
lot about what our students can do but

713
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,159
also they have a lot to learn and the

714
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,440
world has a lot to teach them. I'm sure

715
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,480
that uh your companies and such would be

716
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,159
great um uh uh laboratories for our

717
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,600
students. So, give us a look. Um you've

718
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,480
gotten the real deal. This is the

719
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,480
chancellor unplugged kind of. I didn't

720
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,000
tell you all everything because you know

721
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,200
this is being taped, but

722
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,240
but it's usually all all good.

723
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,480
Thank you. Um, with that, uh, the next

724
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,600
session, I don't know who's jumping on

725
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,799
stage, but thank you so much. Thank you.

726
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,799
Really appreciate it. Okay.
