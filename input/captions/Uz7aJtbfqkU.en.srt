1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,920
Okay. So, this is this is our last class

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,680
before spring break. This is sort of

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,279
like the halfway mark of the of the

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,680
semester. Um, in the beginning of it,

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,680
I'm going to continue with some product

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,400
theory. Um, and uh try to get to a good

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,000
a good place with it. Um but then in the

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
second half I wanted to kind of check in

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,200
with everybody about some possible

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,440
directions for the second half of the

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,719
class.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Um okay so in in some product theory

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
last time we introduced some fundamental

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,200
tools from additive combinotaurics the

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,399
like plunka inequality and ra inequality

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,160
and so on and the the theme of today is

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
like practicing using those

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,160
inequalities.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,160
So let's call this

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,920
Lica

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,920
Raa toolbox.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,280
All right.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,960
Um so these are all inequalities that

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,520
connect

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,520
sums and diff different combinations of

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,960
sums and differences.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:32,240
So there's the ruer triangle inequality

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:37,280
and it says that a * b minus c is

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,759
bounded by a minus b * a minus c

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,320
or if you you can replace b and c by

31
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,320
negative themselves. So you could say

32
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,439
this

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
okay's

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,880
inequality

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,840
says that um

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,479
if

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,479
a + b is at most k * a

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,479
Then

39
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:20,400
B added to it to itself M * minus B

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:24,520
added to itself N times is bounded by K

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,520
to the M + N.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,959
And the main lema inside the proof of

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,959
Plunicus inequality is also useful.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,120
that says um that there exists so that

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,040
we have the same. If if

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,519
then there exists a subset in A which

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,360
sort of has the subset that has the

48
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
additive structure that causes this to

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,599
happen.

50
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,599
So that for any set C,

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,560
X + C + B,

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,560
this over X + C is also at most.

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,879
Okay, cool. So one of our goals today is

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,040
to practice using this toolbox.

55
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,959
Um I was reflecting a little bit on

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,959
where these come from. Um

57
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,959
and I think

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,040
high level point of view of where these

59
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,040
come from is that if if say this set is

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,840
small then there are a lot of

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,879
coincidences where a1 plus b1 is the

62
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,200
same as a2 plus b2 and um by kind of

63
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
rearranging those coincidences can see

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,799
that there are also a lot of

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:56,239
coincidences over there. That's the um

66
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,959
uh rough uh reason for these things.

67
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,239
Okay. Now, I made a small mistake last

68
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,920
time, so I'm going to begin by

69
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,990
correcting it. Thanks for the person who

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,120
pointed it out to me. Um

71
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,760
[Applause]

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
and correcting it is not a bad thing.

73
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,840
It's it's already a good opportunity to

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,759
practice these things.

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,759
Okay, so LMA one from last time was

76
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
stated not quite right. It should have

77
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,120
said

78
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,759
if A is in Z mod P. So this is let's say

79
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,759
let's call this corrections.

80
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,560
Um then either

81
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:44,000
a minus a over a minus a is everything

82
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,680
or um some kind of big mess with a lot

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,840
of addition and multiplication and

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,479
subtraction of a's is a lot bigger than

85
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,240
a okay but the big mess uh actually

86
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,880
should look like this. So you have a *

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,040
a. You add that to itself a bunch of

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,800
times. You also subtract that from

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,639
itself a bunch of times. This is what we

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,280
had last time. But I also need to divide

91
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,000
by a minus a, which I left out last

92
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,400
time. Okay. So the second possibility is

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,560
if you make this giant mess, it's

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,680
significantly bigger than a.

95
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,720
Okay. Um

96
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,120
the proof of this is very clean. Um so

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:33,039
the point is that if a minus a over a

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,840
minus a is not everything

99
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:43,360
then you can find some b in a minus a

100
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:47,560
over a minus a so that b + one is not a

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,560
minus a minus a.

102
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,479
Okay. And then we can say that a squared

103
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,560
is at most a + ba

104
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,000
because if you had any coincidences in

105
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,280
that sum, it would cause b to be written

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,280
uh sorry b + one.

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,840
If we had any coincidences in this sum,

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,600
you could solve for b + one and you

109
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,000
would be able to write it in this way.

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,520
Okay. But b by hypothesis can be written

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,600
this way. So now we have a plus

112
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,759
a minus a over a minus a + one * a. This

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,400
is less than or equal to the size of

114
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,280
this thing. Okay. And then now you just

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,360
expand out this thing. And if you just

116
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,240
expand it out you get this.

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,280
Um, now what I did wrong before is I

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,880
said we can like

119
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,240
sort of multiply by a minus a and and

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,520
like move it. Um, that's that's not

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,639
right. I just want to do something very

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:06,800
simple. You just this is

123
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:10,199
a set of a1 + a2 - a3 over a4 - a5

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,199
+ 1

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,720
* a6.

126
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,479
That's just what this means. And then

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
take this thing and put it over a common

128
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,319
denominator and expand it out. And all

129
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,319
those things you can write this way.

130
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
Okay.

131
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,000
It's always good not to trust me too

132
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,680
much, but does it does it look okay to

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
people?

134
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,199
Okay.

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,400
All right. Um,

136
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,960
cool. So then

137
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,520
I had a lema two from last time, which

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,280
was true, but the uh because it depended

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,960
on lema one, I'm going to have to make

140
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,919
it a little bit weaker. Um and it says

141
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:02,639
that if a is in zp and the size of a is

142
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,319
p to the s z less than s less than one

143
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
then

144
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,599
um

145
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:14,080
can have a cubed minus a cubed

146
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,599
should be at least

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,599
p to the s plus a little

148
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,080
So last time we had a^2 minus a^2 but

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,639
but that was based on having this nicer

150
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,479
thing over here.

151
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,159
Okay.

152
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,120
The proof of this is an excellent

153
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,360
example of practicing using plunic and

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,519
ruse inequalities.

155
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,440
And what we're going to do is we're

156
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,159
going to suppose that this is not true.

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,800
So this thing is quite small.

158
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
And then we'll keep using Pluna

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,120
inversion. We'll see like many other

160
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,640
things are small and eventually we'll

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,959
see that this thing is small uh and this

162
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,480
thing is small uh and which is

163
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,320
impossible by lema one.

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,160
Okay.

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,360
So

166
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,040
let's start with a remark.

167
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,640
Um

168
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,200
all right. So that we have that that

169
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:21,839
messy thing a^ 2

170
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:25,680
+ 3 - a^ 2 + 3. Let's call this b. A

171
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:30,480
minus a call it c.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:35,760
And so lema 1 tells us that the size of

173
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:38,920
b / c is at least p to the s plus a

174
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,920
little bit.

175
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,040
Um

176
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,320
why? Um well

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,120
uh this this B over C it contains just A

178
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,920
minus A over A minus A. So one

179
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,279
possibility is it has the full size P.

180
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,519
And then that would be good. That's a

181
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,680
little bigger than P to the S. And the

182
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
other possibility is that it's at least

183
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,839
a squ. So then it's at least P to the

184
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,640
2s. And again that's that's good.

185
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,519
Okay,

186
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,279
so this guy is actually pretty big and

187
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,680
we're going to to we're going to say if

188
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,040
we suppose that this is small then more

189
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,640
and more things will be small and

190
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,720
eventually this will be small and have a

191
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,720
contradiction.

192
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
Okay, so we'll do a proof by

193
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
contradiction. All right, let me just

194
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,680
say

195
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,040
a cub minus a cubed is less than k* a.

196
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,040
And we're going to see that try to prove

197
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,360
that k is big.

198
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,920
All right. So this has a couple of easy

199
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,440
corlaries. One is that a cubed itself is

200
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,279
bounded by k * a. And another thing is

201
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,760
that a cub minus a cubed is bounded by k

202
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,760
* a cubed.

203
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,360
Okay.

204
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,240
So I can now plug this one into plumacus

205
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,920
inequality into into yeah inequality.

206
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,839
Once this one difference is small then I

207
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,640
could add up many copies of a cubed and

208
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,200
that would be also small.

209
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,640
So this inequality says that I can take

210
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,600
a cub to one big power

211
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,760
minus a cubed to some other big power

212
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,880
and that will be bounded by k + n * a

213
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,720
cubed but a cubed by hypothesis is

214
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,720
basically n. So this is k + n + 1.

215
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,800
So all of these guys are

216
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:43,200
okay. Now what about

217
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,320
um so um that covers B. So B is

218
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,839
certainly small but um we need to think

219
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,000
about B divided by C.

220
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,880
Um

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,800
yeah so B divided by C is not quite

222
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,279
obvious how it fits in here. But if you

223
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,760
take B and you multiply it by C then

224
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,560
you'll get a sum of degree three things

225
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:10,920
which will be part of this. So that

226
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,920
tells us that B * C is small.

227
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,560
Um

228
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,160
and B * C and B divided by C are related

229
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:28,959
to each other. We can I we can also say

230
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,959
that a * b and a * c these will also be

231
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,959
c.

232
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,320
Okay. Um so then we can use ruse's

233
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:45,920
inequality to relate b / c to these

234
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:51,440
guys. And so could say a * b / c is

235
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:55,120
smaller than uh a * b a * c. So this is

236
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:59,639
the multiplicative version of uh the

237
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,639
rusa inequality version two.

238
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,760
So subtraction has been replaced by

239
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,920
division and addition has been replaced

240
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,720
by multiplication.

241
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:13,519
Okay. And then this is bounded by k to

242
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:17,440
the order of 1 * a^ 2 and cancel the a's

243
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,639
and we get that uh so b over c on the

244
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
one hand is big p to the s plus gamma

245
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,320
it's bounded by b over c but on the

246
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,320
other hand it's small

247
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,120
and if you compare these you see that k

248
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,120
needs to be at least a small power of p.

249
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,399
Okay. Um

250
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,600
and then our third lema

251
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,040
uh was that if you if you take a subset

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,720
a and you it starts off maybe small p to

253
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,240
the s and you'd like to get take

254
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,920
products and stuff and and you'd like to

255
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,680
get up to something much bigger some p

256
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,600
to the t then you can do that with a

257
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
controlled number of additions and

258
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,800
multiplications.

259
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,279
Um, okay. So, here's what it says.

260
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,560
So, the definition

261
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:33,680
poly k of a is a take a product of k

262
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:38,120
things take a sum of k of those and you

263
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,120
can also subtract similar stuff.

264
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:48,639
And then lema 3 says uh if 0 is less

265
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:51,920
than s is less than t is less than one

266
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,800
then there exists some k that only

267
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,959
depends on s and t.

268
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,199
So that

269
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:03,199
um if A is a subset of FP of size P to

270
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,320
the S

271
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,839
um then

272
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,880
the size of poly K of A

273
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,880
is at least P to the T.

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
So I sort of you start with a set A and

275
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,079
you're allowed to add and multiply then

276
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,040
in a controlled amount of time you can

277
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:28,279
spread out to cover a very large chunk

278
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,279
of FB.

279
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:38,600
Okay. And the proof of this is just

280
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,600
repeat lambda 2 many times.

281
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,079
All right. So this is sort of where we

282
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,519
left off last time with with this

283
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,519
mistake about the denominators correct.

284
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Okay.

285
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,399
Yeah.

286
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,600
So um a takeaway that I have from the

287
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,320
Rusa and Punicus inequality is that

288
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,000
there's some kind of contagiousness of

289
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,639
structure. So if if you see that one

290
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,360
projection or few projections are very

291
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,680
small um then it implies that some other

292
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
projections are small or few if a few

293
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,079
subsets are small it implies that other

294
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,079
subsets are small.

295
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,079
Um,

296
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,959
so

297
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,959
that that

298
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,079
Okay,

299
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,079
so let me spell that out.

300
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,160
contagious

301
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,160
structure.

302
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:21,039
Okay. So, contagious structure lema one

303
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:24,720
says that uh so Z isn't it? So, in in

304
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,400
all of these things maybe I should say

305
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,799
These are theorems that work in any

306
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,440
aelion group. So Z is an aelion group

307
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,039
and and and they have some of them have

308
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,559
versions of nonabelian groups too that

309
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,960
are not that different although we won't

310
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,919
talk about that too but okay and we have

311
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,919
some subsets of this group

312
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,480
[Applause]

313
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,480
so same setting. So Z is a billion

314
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,480
group.

315
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:06,880
All right. So suppose that a + t1 * a is

316
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,799
not too much bigger than a

317
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,400
and also

318
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,720
a + t2 * a is not that much bigger than

319
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,200
a.

320
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,200
And remember that these are this so this

321
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,039
kind of thing is basic in some additive

322
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,799
combinator some product theory but it

323
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,559
also looks like a projection. We're

324
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,120
taking the products at a cross a and

325
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,360
we're projecting it in the t2 direction.

326
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Okay. So if we have these two small

327
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,840
projections

328
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,080
then

329
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,200
if I project in the direction t1 plus t2

330
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,200
it's also small

331
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
pretty

332
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,200
actually let's do let's do t1 times t2

333
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,480
first because that's easier and this

334
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,480
will be a nicer

335
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,480
fixed.

336
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,760
All right. So, there's the proof. Um

337
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,799
All right.

338
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,320
Um

339
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay.

340
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:20,600
So, this this is uh

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,600
actually let me also make all of these

342
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,840
Yeah, let's also make all of these minus

343
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,840
signs.

344
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Okay. So, a minus t1 a is quite small

345
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,360
and a minus t2 a is quite small.

346
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,799
I'm going to multiply this just by a

347
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,520
constant t1.

348
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:57,200
So, so this here it implies that t1 a

349
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,679
minus t1 t2 a

350
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,679
is quite small.

351
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,559
Okay,

352
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,440
Russa had this funny idea

353
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,280
that to

354
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,640
sort of think of the size of this as

355
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,200
some kind of distance between A and T1

356
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:25,760
A. So A is kind of close to T1 A. And

357
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,159
also T1 A is kind of close to T1 T2 A.

358
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,400
And so something like the triangle

359
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,039
inequality would tell us that A is close

360
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,960
to T1 T2 A.

361
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,080
And you you can really use the rera

362
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,080
triangle inequality in this way. Okay.

363
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,080
So the proof is by rera triangle

364
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,080
inequality.

365
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:55,280
Um and um so we have to decide who's a

366
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,320
and who's b and who's c.

367
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,240
And we want b minus c. We're going to

368
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,840
try to bond b minus c. So this is going

369
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:12,960
to be b minus c. Um so our um so our

370
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll call it b bar is a c bar is t1 t2 a

371
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,000
and then a bar I guess must be t1 a

372
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:31,919
okay so then the inequality says t1 a *

373
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:37,760
a minus t1 t2 a bounded by

374
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:41,120
um a bar minus b bar. So t1 a minus a

375
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:45,799
time a bar minus c bar

376
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,799
t1 a - t1 t2.

377
00:21:47,600 --> 00:22:00,120
Okay. So a * a minus t1 t2 a is bounded

378
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,120
by these guys that are both small k

379
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,559
and then that's it. I just divide by a.

380
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,880
Okay. So if the d projection in the

381
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,520
negative t1 direction and negative t2

382
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,480
directions are small and same for the

383
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,960
negative t1 * t2 direction that's also

384
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,039
small.

385
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,890
All right.

386
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,529
Um

387
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,529
[Applause]

388
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,559
All right. Contagious structure lema 2.

389
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,600
You can replace T by minus T.

390
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:57,360
So if A + T A is less than or equal to K

391
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:02,159
a then

392
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,720
a minus T A is less than or equal to K.

393
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,960
Yeah. So we saw this last time that if

394
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,600
if a sum set is big then the different

395
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
set should also be sorry if a sum set is

396
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,960
small then the different set should also

397
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,559
be pretty small and vice versa.

398
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,559
Yeah.

399
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,559
Okay. So this is also uh

400
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,559
also pl so this is going to be a pluna

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,559
inequality proof.

402
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:40,000
So let's say that t a is b.

403
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,840
So a plus b is pretty small. And then

404
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,840
therefore we get that b minus b.

405
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,320
No.

406
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,240
Okay, let's try Ruse's inequality.

407
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,400
So,

408
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,320
I'll say this is B and this is C because

409
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,799
I want to have that B minus C on the

410
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,919
right hand side.

411
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,919
And then uh

412
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,919
uh M A I guess can be a

413
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,320
A minus T I

414
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,159
less than or equal to

415
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,000
um and then let's use the second

416
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,720
version.

417
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,640
A + A A + T.

418
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,840
So the so this one we know is small. Now

419
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,720
we need to check that this one is small.

420
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:14,799
Um and but by plunicus inequality

421
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:17,200
starting here um a + a is less than a 2

422
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:21,400
a.

423
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,400
So this is less than k.

424
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,720
Okay. And now the most interesting and

425
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,240
difficult of the contagious structure

426
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:45,600
leas says that if

427
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:51,000
a + t a is small a + t1 a is small

428
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,000
and a + t2 a is small

429
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,960
then

430
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,960
a + t1 + t2

431
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,880
is small.

432
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,760
This is the trickiest. So, I ended up

433
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,760
needing the largest exponent.

434
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Okay.

435
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,640
Um,

436
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,720
all right. So, this is a very good

437
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,279
exercise in combining these things.

438
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,760
We're going to start with this and we're

439
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,640
going to relate it to some sets that are

440
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,039
sound even much bigger. Um, but then

441
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,279
those sets we can easily chop through

442
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,679
with these inequalities and get back to

443
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,679
to a.

444
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:52,279
Okay. So,

445
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,279
a + t1 + t2 a

446
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,440
I'm going to bound that. And this this

447
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:03,000
looks quite wasteful by a plus t1 a plus

448
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,000
t2 a.

449
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,520
So this is quite wasteful because I'm

450
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:11,120
allowed to have t1 * one guy plus t2 *

451
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,320
the other guy. Here I only had t1 plus

452
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,960
t2 times the same guy. But it's a true

453
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,120
inequality.

454
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Okay.

455
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:28,000
Uh, and it's helpful because we know

456
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,760
something about adding T1A to somebody.

457
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,799
And actually, the nicest thing we know

458
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,799
about adding T1A comes from the main

459
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,799
LMA.

460
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,919
So here in the main lema, you know, we

461
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,400
could have this B could be T1A.

462
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,960
And then we'll have a very general thing

463
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,720
about when you add B to somebody of this

464
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,720
form. and it doesn't get very much

465
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,720
bigger.

466
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,000
So have the main lama.

467
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:08,880
Uh and it tells us that there is subset

468
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:14,559
x1 in a so that for every c x1 + c + t1

469
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,240
a is bounded by k * x1 + c.

470
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,120
Whenever you see a sum like this, you

471
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,799
can remove this plus T1A and it only

472
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,799
slightly increases the size of the set

473
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,120
or you can Yeah. Okay. And same for X2.

474
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,520
[Applause]

475
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,360
Okay. Um,

476
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,240
okay. So now

477
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,679
we want to bound this thing

478
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,080
and we could get rid of the T1 A and get

479
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,799
rid of the T2A by by using this

480
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,919
inequality if the rest of the stuff had

481
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,440
the form X1 plus somebody or X2 plus

482
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,360
somebody.

483
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,600
We don't have an X1 plus somebody here

484
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,279
and X2 plus somebody in here. So I'm

485
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
just going to add them in, which again

486
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,679
sounds extremely wasteful, but is

487
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,679
actually okay.

488
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:49,480
So a + t1 a + t2 a that is bounded by x1

489
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,480
+ x2 + a + t1 a + t2.

490
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,559
All right. So now this has the form x1

491
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,159
plus some stuff plus t1a. And I can get

492
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:07,279
rid of the T1A by main lema one.

493
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:15,960
So that's less than X1 less than I pick

494
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:15,960
up a factor of K. X1 + X2 + A plus T2 A.

495
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,000
And then this thing has X2 plus some

496
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,840
stuff plus T2A. So I can get rid of the

497
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:35,320
T2A by by main LMA one again.

498
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,320
So this is less than k^2 x1 + x2 + a.

499
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:43,840
Now x1 and x2 are subsets of a. So this

500
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:46,320
is less than k^ 2 a + a + a. And then by

501
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,840
plunicas inequality

502
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,840
this is less than k 5*

503
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,520
Yeah.

504
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,240
>> What do you mean that a + a is less than

505
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,799
k a but you can only get k^2 a from the

506
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,350
a + t1?

507
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,440
Um

508
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:16,159
[Applause]

509
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,919
so starting from here and applying

510
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:23,520
plunka I can say if you call this guy B

511
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,640
that B cubed is smaller B plus B plus B

512
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:30,240
is bounded by K cubed A and B plus B

513
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,240
plus B is the same as

514
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:35,840
[Applause]

515
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,960
>> yeah it wouldn't really matter if this

516
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,960
was a bigger number

517
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,000
Okay,

518
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,039
cool.

519
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,120
Cool. Okay, so qualitatively we have

520
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:54,880
this picture that

521
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,360
the small projections are organized.

522
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,200
They have um

523
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,240
algebraic structure. You can take you

524
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,840
can add two small projections. You can

525
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,519
take the negative of one of them. You

526
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,039
can multiply them. So they are a ring.

527
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,559
It's not so clear that one is in there,

528
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:15,120
but um anyway, they have they have a lot

529
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,960
of algebraic structure.

530
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,679
And that mesh is something that we saw

531
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,760
in in in examples, you know, when we

532
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,519
wrote down like here's an interesting

533
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,679
set that has a lot of small projections

534
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,120
on the first day. The interesting set

535
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,640
was an integer grid. So integer cross

536
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,039
integer

537
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,360
and the set of directions were rational

538
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,120
numbers with small small uh numerators

539
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,360
and denominators

540
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,799
and you know if you add two rational

541
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,480
numbers you get another rational number.

542
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,880
If you multiply two rational numbers you

543
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:54,000
get another rational number.

544
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,000
And um and the numerology here is

545
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,640
roughly maybe not precisely but roughly

546
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,640
consistent with that.

547
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,960
So if you took rational numbers with

548
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,440
very small numerators and denominators,

549
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,200
you get really great projections.

550
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,399
Then if you add two of them, you get a

551
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,880
new guy where the numerator and

552
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,279
denominator are bigger. And that is

553
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,880
still a pretty good projection even

554
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,279
though it's not quite as great as what

555
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,000
you started with. and and that's what we

556
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,519
see here. So this guy is a pretty good

557
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,519
projection although not quite as great

558
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,760
as what we started with. And same with

559
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,679
addition.

560
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,480
Okay. So that structural feature of our

561
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,240
first example, it was not just a

562
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,240
coincidence about that example. It's a

563
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,480
general thing and um and it follows from

564
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,480
these inequalities.

565
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,720
Okay.

566
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,320
Okay. Great. So now with with this

567
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,519
toolbox we're going to start to make

568
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,000
progress towards the the Borgan cats tow

569
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,000
projection theorem

570
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,880
and we will we will prove uh an

571
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,519
important an important inequality of

572
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,519
some product theorem.

573
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,960
So there is a theorem.

574
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,800
So if a is a subset of FP and it has a

575
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,440
certain size

576
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,760
P to the S A

577
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:38,320
and D is a set of directions in FP.

578
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:40,960
D is P to the S D.

579
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,639
Um let's say that each of these is

580
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,599
strictly between zero and one. Then

581
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:52,679
there exists some epsilon depends on the

582
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,679
dimens on the s's big greater than zero.

583
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:02,160
So that the following thing is true. The

584
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:07,560
maximum t and d of a + t a is

585
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,560
significantly bigger than a.

586
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay. So let's make some remarks about

587
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,200
it. So here's an easy correlary. Um if

588
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,040
you just take a plus a time a that

589
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,960
should be bigger than a

590
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,440
uh why let a be d

591
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,280
and plug it in.

592
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,560
But this theorem is stronger than this

593
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,920
corlary in two important ways.

594
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,040
One point is that we're not taking the

595
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,680
union over d of all these sets.

596
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,839
We're just taking the maximum overd of

597
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,880
all these sets which op priori is a much

598
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,280
smaller thing.

599
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,720
And the other point is that the set of

600
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,880
directions is independent from A. So the

601
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,280
most interesting case here is when SD is

602
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,520
much smaller than SA. So we have a

603
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,119
medium-sized set

604
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,280
uh a but we have we consider only quite

605
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
few different projections and still

606
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,119
that's enough that one of those

607
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,440
projections will cause uh the projection

608
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,440
to get bigger.

609
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,599
Okay.

610
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,839
Um we're going to use one of our tools

611
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,359
from Yeah.

612
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,079
in

613
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,079
uh this is essay.

614
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,680
Okay, we're going to use one of our

615
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,640
tools from day one of projection theory

616
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,640
which was the double counting.

617
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,240
So at the beginning of projection

618
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,720
theory, we proved that if X is in FP2

619
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:16,880
and D is in FP

620
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:18,960
Then um the maximum over t and d of pi t

621
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,599
of x

622
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,920
is at least

623
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,160
a minimum of the size of x and the size

624
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,160
of d.

625
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,520
Okay.

626
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:42,480
So um

627
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:47,359
so if it was the case that uh SD

628
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:52,359
was bigger than S A then then this

629
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,359
double counter implies our our

630
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,480
because then this maximum would be at

631
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,440
least either P to the 2 SA which is the

632
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,920
size of our X or P to the SD which is

633
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,920
the size of

634
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,599
Okay, by itself that so that that is

635
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,599
worth noticing. But by itself it's not

636
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,119
that exciting. The hard case of our

637
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:21,800
theorem is when SD is far smaller than

638
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,800
S. It has to be positive.

639
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,800
All right.

640
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,160
So here's the proof of our theorem that

641
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,440
combines the ideas that we've seen

642
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,839
today.

643
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,240
So first of all, even though D itself is

644
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,680
small, if I'm allowed to add and

645
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,480
multiply elements of D, then I can make

646
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,880
that as big as I like.

647
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:05,200
So the first step is by lema 3 there

648
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:08,560
exists um some K which depends on SA and

649
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,599
SD. So that

650
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:17,720
poly k of d

651
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,720
is significantly bigger than p to the s.

652
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,520
And therefore

653
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,680
by our double counting argument there is

654
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,680
a u in poly k of d.

655
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:42,599
So that a + u aa is significantly bigger

656
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,599
than a.

657
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,680
So we don't yet have

658
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,400
a a a u that's actually in d, but we

659
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,320
have a u that is formed by doing a

660
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,920
bounded number of multiplications and

661
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,920
additions and so on of things in d.

662
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
And we play this against the contagious

663
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,680
structure.

664
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,680
So um

665
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,920
if

666
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:23,440
the maximum t and d of a + t a was less

667
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,440
than k a.

668
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,280
Then we can use contagious structure

669
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,000
many times

670
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,160
and we'll see that also this guy should

671
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,160
be small.

672
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,359
So then

673
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,560
here's our contagious structure and we

674
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:49,040
get that the maximum U

675
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:54,560
in poly K of D of A plus UA is smaller

676
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:58,240
than K to a power um power here. And so

677
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,079
this power depends on little K.

678
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,880
But then if you unwind, little K depends

679
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,880
on SA and S.

680
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,280
All right. So if all of these

681
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,800
projections had been really small then

682
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,720
other projections would be small where

683
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,319
you add or take negatives or multiply

684
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,520
and you would get by putting that

685
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,520
together you would get that these are

686
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,520
small.

687
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,880
Okay. Okay. And so the conclusion is

688
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,800
that K to the C is bigger than P to the

689
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,440
gamma. And so K is bigger than P to the

690
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,359
gamma over C which is our P to the

691
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,359
epsilon. That's the proof.

692
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,200
Okay. So, let me restate um the

693
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,359
projection theorem that was sort of this

694
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,839
uh that we announced on Tuesday as our

695
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,599
next big goal and we'll compare it to

696
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,359
this theorem and we'll see that it's

697
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,240
closely related, but there there's still

698
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,240
something that we need to do.

699
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:48,960
Okay. So our our goal which we won't get

700
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:55,520
to today but assume is a theorem

701
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:57,520
KT that if X contained in FP^2

702
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,400
and

703
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:05,520
X could be P to the SX where SX is

704
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,599
really between zero and two

705
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:13,280
and D is contained at FP. P

706
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:18,480
the size of D is P to the SD where SD is

707
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,560
bigger than zero. Um then the maximum of

708
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,240
the projections is bigger than the

709
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:28,960
square root of X. So the maximum T of D

710
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:33,960
of projection T of X is at least P to

711
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,960
the epsilon X to the 12.

712
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,960
Okay.

713
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,119
So, so this theorem although the epsilon

714
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,280
is small is important because it's the

715
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,280
first theorem in projection theory that

716
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,160
fundamentally distinguishes the prime

717
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,240
fields from not prime fields.

718
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,079
And that is important in many

719
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,800
applications and it gets kind of

720
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,599
bootstrapped in the strong theorems that

721
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,839
that recent uh you know strong theorems

722
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,000
like ka conjecture versus conjecture and

723
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,720
stuff like that.

724
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,280
Okay. So let's compare this goal to what

725
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,680
we have from some product theory. They

726
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,880
look almost the same if you just set x

727
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,880
equal to a cross a.

728
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,880
So

729
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,999
one.

730
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,999
[Applause]

731
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:42,960
So theorem one is equal to

732
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:49,000
theorem bkt in the special case

733
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,000
that x is a product set a cross a

734
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,880
any questions or comments.

735
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,920
Okay, so maybe it's worth reflecting

736
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,920
since this was our main goal. Um,

737
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,440
why in the proof of theorem one did we

738
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,440
need to know that X was a product set?

739
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,599
So proof of theorem one is over here.

740
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,440
It's not very long. This double counting

741
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,040
argument has nothing to do with product

742
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,160
sets.

743
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,079
And we start to go along. We can say um

744
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,160
that the

745
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,240
the direction self it itself might be

746
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,560
very small but we if we take polomials

747
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,400
in the direction set then we get

748
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,720
something big. So up to here we have not

749
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,520
used at all that our set is a product

750
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,599
set. This would have worked for any x

751
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,119
and then we use the contagious

752
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,760
structure.

753
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,000
So the contagious structure said that if

754
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,839
if if all of these guys were small then

755
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,240
also the projections in directions t

756
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:02,000
plus one t1 plus t2 and so on are also

757
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,079
small. That contagious structure step

758
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,280
did use the fact that this had this

759
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,720
particular form which allowed us to

760
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
think about everything in terms of

761
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,520
ruse's inequality and the pluna

762
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,920
inequality and so on.

763
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,760
So I have been asking myself if it is

764
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,000
possible to prove those contagious

765
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,480
structure things uh directly for

766
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,480
arbitrary sets.

767
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,800
Um I I believe that they're true. Um

768
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,079
and it sort of follow so that the the

769
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,760
proof of this theorem is going to be

770
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,839
some kind of reduction to the case of

771
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,000
product sets. Um, so I think that in

772
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,480
hindsight the contagious structure is

773
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,760
true in general and so it I don't know

774
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,440
it seems like perhaps it would be

775
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,720
natural that it could be proven in

776
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,720
general but I'm not sure.

777
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,960
Okay.

778
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,240
Now on the other hand I would like to

779
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,520
argue that okay so so so then then at

780
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,240
first you see this and you say well

781
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,800
product sets are extremely special

782
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,280
subclass of all sets. So this is not

783
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:09,520
very good. But I would like to try to

784
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:11,920
argue that if X uh is a if this if this

785
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,800
thing is small at all then X is quite

786
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,560
close to a product set.

787
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,400
And if I convince you of that then maybe

788
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,560
you'll feel like like what we've done so

789
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,240
far is actually pretty close to our

790
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,319
goal.

791
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,319
All right.

792
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:33,640
[Applause]

793
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,640
So let's talk about that.

794
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,369
[Music]

795
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:52,960
All right. So okay. So remember that pi

796
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:57,359
t of x1 x2 is x1 + t x2

797
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:01,040
and also pi infinity of x1 x2 is simply

798
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:03,280
x2. It's just a convention. Okay. Now we

799
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,720
have some set of directions

800
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,480
and by performing a change of variables

801
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,720
we can assume that two of the directions

802
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,760
are zero and infinity.

803
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:17,920
So without loss of generality the

804
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:20,560
direction D is zero and infinity and

805
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,119
then some other directions.

806
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:28,000
Okay.

807
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:32,640
Right. So now X is any set X is

808
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,319
contained in pi 0 of X cross pi infinity

809
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,480
of X.

810
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,040
So pi 0 of X are all the possible first

811
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,559
coordinates of anybody in X. Pi infinity

812
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,960
of X is all the possible second

813
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,920
coordinates of everybody in X. And so

814
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,319
this product contains X. So this is true

815
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,319
for any set.

816
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,599
But because these are directions in our

817
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,000
direction set um so okay so let's say

818
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:02,319
let's suppose

819
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,240
that the maximum t and d of the size of

820
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:07,839
pi t of x is at most k * the square root

821
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:12,200
of x

822
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,200
and imagine that k is pretty small

823
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:21,119
okay so in that case

824
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:24,800
the size of pi 0x cross p<unk> infinity

825
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:28,960
x. That's the size of p<unk> 0x * the

826
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:32,559
size of pi infinity x. That's at most k^

827
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:36,160
2 times the size of x.

828
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:40,640
So this here is an actual product set. X

829
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:43,200
is sitting inside of it and x is um

830
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:47,040
occupies a large fraction of it if this

831
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:50,400
is a scenario that we're worried about.

832
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:53,119
Okay. So in order to prove this theorem

833
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:57,440
um it suffices to prove it for sets that

834
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,040
are a large fraction of a product set

835
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,000
and on the other hand we've just proven

836
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,760
it for actual product sets.

837
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,240
Okay. So now maybe it feels like this

838
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,240
theorem is is in reach that we just have

839
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,760
to all we have to do is to take our

840
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,920
proof that works for honest product

841
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,680
sets. We have to extend it to something

842
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,520
that is a large fraction of a product

843
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,520
set.

844
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,520
Cool.

845
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,520
Okay. So, we'll do that after the break.

846
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,280
It does involve some significant ideas.

847
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,760
There are significant recurring ideas in

848
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,559
additive cominatorics and projection

849
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,800
theory and lots of stuff. Uh, and there

850
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,400
are ideas about going back and forth

851
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,200
between something that is true um a

852
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:45,880
large fraction of the time and something

853
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,880
that's true uh all the time.

854
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,400
Okay, so that's the part of the class

855
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,720
today about some product theory. Take a

856
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,520
minute and see if you have any questions

857
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,920
or comments and then we'll let that rest

858
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,920
for the break.

859
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,079
Yeah.

860
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:27,319
>> So is it like in the true we have our

861
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,319
freedom to choose like gamma?

862
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,359
>> Yeah that's right. We have a lot of we

863
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,920
have freedom to choose gamma. So lma 3

864
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:37,520
lets us put here any exponent t that we

865
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,800
like and then this k will depend on t.

866
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,359
So this gamma can be pretty big. Um this

867
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,359
you know we could be halfway from SA to

868
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:49,119
one.

869
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:52,480
>> Can you see there depends on

870
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:56,800
like like in the last line it's like

871
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:59,359
sort of like absolute equal to gamma

872
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,480
in the last.

873
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,240
>> Yeah. So this C

874
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,640
um yeah I mean we could make it maybe

875
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,960
it's more maybe it's helpful to say

876
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,800
gamma is one minus SA over two. So yes

877
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,960
things depend on gamma but gamma just

878
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,240
depends on SA. So things still only

879
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,400
depend on SA and S.

880
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,079
>> Okay. Um

881
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:28,559
would there be a like gamma that give us

882
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,160
a nice bump for the absolute there?

883
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,480
>> Yeah. So another thing you might wonder

884
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,079
about is you might like you know you

885
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,200
might want to write down the actual size

886
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,200
of epsilon and you might like to uh

887
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,880
adjust the parameters in our argument

888
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,000
strategically to make it as big as

889
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,400
possible. Um so you can do that the

890
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,839
actual size of epsilon is there's a

891
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,760
formula for it but it it is pretty small

892
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,280
and so people often don't write it down

893
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,720
that carefully. Um adjusting gamma who

894
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,880
knows I think something like this is

895
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,720
reasonable. um it's not going to help a

896
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,480
whole lot.

897
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,160
Yeah. Yeah.

898
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,359
>> What is kind of the complication? If you

899
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,040
just kind of try and sort of

900
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:09,680
straightforwardly plug this into theorem

901
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,480
one, you can say that this will be kind

902
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:15,599
of less than guess you can take pi 0 of

903
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,800
x union of pi infinity of x as a and

904
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:22,240
then apply to theorem one which seems

905
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,720
like it would contradict kind of the the

906
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,680
statement that the projections are all

907
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,359
less than the square root of x.

908
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,240
Am I missing something kind of more

909
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,160
subtle there?

910
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,040
>> Yeah. Okay. So what so what happens now

911
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,480
if we try to directly deduce our goal

912
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:42,559
theorem from theorem one. So let's let's

913
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:46,079
say a is defined to be pi 0 of x union

914
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:49,760
pi infinity of x and so x is indeed a

915
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:55,079
subset of a cross

916
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,079
and the size of a is still basically

917
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:04,079
this or this.

918
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:10,400
Okay. So now theorem one tells us that

919
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:16,760
the maximum uh t and d of the size of

920
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,760
pi t of a cross a is big.

921
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,440
Um

922
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:30,079
okay now we actually want to bound the

923
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:33,760
size of pi t of x. How are these related

924
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:38,079
to each other? Well, this is a subset of

925
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:41,280
this. So, we we know this.

926
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,599
Um, but that's the wrong direction for

927
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,359
this to be helpful.

928
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,880
So, we're worried about the following

929
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:53,400
scenario

930
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,400
that x so a cross a is a product.

931
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,520
So there's a cross a and inside of it is

932
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,319
x

933
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,079
which is a pretty big fraction

934
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,800
x

935
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:10,720
and then somehow we managed to find a

936
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:13,520
projection where

937
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,480
the projection of x

938
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:20,079
is quite small

939
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:22,000
even though the projection of a cross a

940
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,079
we know the projection of a cross a is

941
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
large but maybe there's significant

942
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:30,920
piece that got projected onto something

943
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,920
small. That's what we don't know yet.

944
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,599
Okay. So, um

945
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,200
so your next homework assignment is due

946
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,119
the week after the break and it's not a

947
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,960
regular problem set with problems. It is

948
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,839
a check-in and reflection about the

949
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,680
class. So, you'll ask people to reflect

950
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,760
on um you know what what we've what

951
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,319
we've learned so far, see what parts

952
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:06,720
seem confusing or what parts seem like

953
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:08,799
clear. Um and then to um and then to

954
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,440
think about what direction we'd like to

955
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,760
go in in the second half of the class.

956
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,680
Um so there are a bunch of topics that I

957
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,240
think is cool are cool that we could

958
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,160
talk about and we could talk about just

959
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,040
one or two of them in depth. we could do

960
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,720
all of them in less depth. Um, and I

961
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,200
wanted to get your thoughts about it.

962
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,720
So, I remind people what the topics are

963
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,280
and introduce some of them that I

964
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,799
haven't properly introduced before. So,

965
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,799
for for for context.

966
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,799
Okay.

967
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,240
Um,

968
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,920
okay. So, these are topics that are

969
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,680
connected to maybe applications of maybe

970
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,559
extensions of the stuff in projection

971
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,559
theory that we have learned.

972
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:20,040
Okay. So one topic is um mixing

973
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,040
or random walks on discrete groups

974
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,319
and some of the key names are.

975
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:41,839
Um

976
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:44,559
another topic is a part of homogeneous

977
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:46,559
dynamics

978
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:50,920
and it's also about mixing. It's like

979
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,920
mixing of orchids.

980
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,880
Um and some of the names involved in it

981
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,480
are Margulus

982
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,480
Danny

983
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,480
Aratner.

984
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,960
Um and there's some recent work of

985
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,960
Lynden Strauss.

986
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,920
Okay, there is um Fenberg which is like

987
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,559
the sharp sharp projection theory

988
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,559
estimate in two dimensions. Um and

989
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,680
another thing that's related to this is

990
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,680
the CA problem and there's a recent you

991
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,599
know recent proof of the CA conjecture.

992
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,359
Monday after break the colloquium Hong

993
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,319
Wong is going to come and talk about the

994
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:33,520
Ka conjecture.

995
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:35,119
Okay. Um, so I wanted to tell you a

996
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:40,240
little bit about some of these things

997
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:41,440
and um, uh, I just you can make give be

998
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,119
a little informed as you think about

999
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,559
what you'd like to study. Um, okay. So,

1000
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,000
this one I tried to mention on the first

1001
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,559
day, but I don't think we really talked

1002
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,559
about it at all.

1003
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,440
I wanted to say something about it.

1004
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,720
Um

1005
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:28,319
okay. So, so homo the word homogeneous

1006
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:31,359
is a reference to homogeneous spaces and

1007
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:33,520
a typical example of a homogeneous space

1008
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:37,040
is slnr

1009
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:40,000
modulo slnz

1010
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,799
call this x. It's homogeneous in the

1011
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,440
sense that slnr acts on this space on

1012
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:47,119
the left and it the action is

1013
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,440
transitive. So every point gets mapped

1014
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,640
to every other point.

1015
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:56,480
um why would you care about this space?

1016
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:59,720
So you can think of X as the space

1017
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,720
of lises

1018
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:07,760
in Rn

1019
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:10,720
with co one

1020
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:13,680
y. So start with the unit cube lice. I

1021
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:18,240
can make another lattice of co one by

1022
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:20,079
applying an element of sr to my lattice.

1023
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:23,359
Um, now not all of those will be

1024
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,520
different. So if my element was in SLNZ,

1025
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,760
it will map the lattice Z to the N to

1026
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,880
itself. So that's the kernel of this

1027
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,280
map. And so the space of lises is the

1028
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:38,880
quotient like this.

1029
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:42,559
Okay. Um, so that's a homogeneous space.

1030
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:46,799
They're homogeneous dynamics. So SLNR

1031
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:51,839
acts on X and it acts uh transitively.

1032
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:57,200
So if you take any X and X um the orbit

1033
01:00:51,839 --> 01:01:00,160
SNR of X is the whole space.

1034
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,319
However, um SLNR has many interesting

1035
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,319
subgroups and you could take one of

1036
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:06,559
those subgroups and look at that orbit

1037
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:11,280
and then different things can happen. So

1038
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:18,160
let's say H is a subgroup of SLNR

1039
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:21,599
and you look at H * X. Um so that's so

1040
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,880
some kind of visual.

1041
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,880
So this space is almost a manifold and

1042
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,640
it has finite volume and it has a little

1043
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:32,160
cusp which sometimes important sometimes

1044
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:36,559
not important. Um and we have a point

1045
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:38,240
little x in here and we take it orbit

1046
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,720
which wraps around this thing in a sort

1047
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,839
of crazy way. It looks sort of looks

1048
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,960
like this. And uh people would like to

1049
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:48,799
know um is this kind of evenly

1050
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,000
distributed on the whole space or does

1051
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:54,319
it uh concentrate somewhere and if so

1052
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,079
where might it concentrate?

1053
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,079
So how is the orbit distributed?

1054
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,680
Okay. So questions of this type come up

1055
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,880
in many places. Let me mention one of

1056
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,880
them to you.

1057
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,840
[Applause]

1058
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:38,359
Um so here is an application in number

1059
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:38,359
theory called the Oenheim conjecture.

1060
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:53,520
Okay. So let's say Q of X1 up to Xn is a

1061
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:56,720
quadratic form

1062
01:02:53,520 --> 01:03:00,559
and the question is to understand how Q

1063
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:03,760
behaves when you put in integers.

1064
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:11,000
So question

1065
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:11,000
how is Q of Z to the N distributed.

1066
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,400
Okay.

1067
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,720
So one observation is that if Q is

1068
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,520
always positive for real numbers then Q

1069
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,079
of Z to the N will be always positive.

1070
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,319
Um and another observation is that if

1071
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:32,079
the coefficients of Q are all integers,

1072
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:33,839
then Q of Z to the N will be integers.

1073
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,880
Um

1074
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,799
and those are the main obvious reasons

1075
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,640
why Q of Z to the N would not be

1076
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:44,160
distributed evenly on the real numbers.

1077
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,760
Um

1078
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:51,119
so motivated by that, Oenheim made this

1079
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,039
conjecture quite a while ago. So

1080
01:03:51,119 --> 01:04:00,240
conjecture is that if n is at least

1081
01:03:53,039 --> 01:04:02,079
three and the signature of q is next so

1082
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,760
it's not always positive and not always

1083
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:07,760
negative

1084
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,720
and um the uh

1085
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:15,920
u the coefficients

1086
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:18,240
of q are not contained in z time alpha

1087
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,960
for any alpha.

1088
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,960
Um then

1089
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:27,240
Q of Z to the N should be dense

1090
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,200
and and also in fact not just dense but

1091
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,640
kind of these conjectures said it should

1092
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,240
be dense but later people thought you

1093
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,400
know if you take a big ball and Z to the

1094
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,839
N and you apply Q to it you should get a

1095
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,680
set of points that are quite evenly

1096
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:46,559
distributed in um along an interval in

1097
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,559
the real way.

1098
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,559
Okay.

1099
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:55,559
Okay. So this conjecture was proven by

1100
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,559
Margulus

1101
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:05,760
and his proof involves connecting this

1102
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:08,480
problem to this setup of an orbit in in

1103
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,319
the space of lises.

1104
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,319
So how does the connection go? Well, the

1105
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:18,079
way I've written it right now, I have

1106
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:20,799
the standard lattice Zn and I have some

1107
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:23,359
obscure quadratic form. But I could make

1108
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:25,359
a change of variables so that Q is a

1109
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:28,000
standard quadratic form and then I would

1110
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:30,960
have some obscure lattice.

1111
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:36,400
So after a change of variables,

1112
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:38,000
um Q could be just X1 2 plus X K. Let's

1113
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,240
say we're just in three variables and we

1114
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:48,160
have a mixed size. Q is just this.

1115
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:54,599
But um Z3 is becomes maybe Q becomes

1116
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:54,599
this Z3 becomes lambda a new lattice.

1117
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,319
Okay.

1118
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,720
Okay.

1119
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:06,079
So now we have a lattice which is one

1120
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,520
point in that space

1121
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,319
and we don't know anything about it

1122
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:13,039
really. could be any point.

1123
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:16,160
But why would we have a whole orbit?

1124
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:19,359
Well, we have a whole orbit

1125
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:22,359
because this quadratic form has a lot of

1126
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,359
symmetries.

1127
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:28,240
So remark

1128
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:30,799
um the group SO21

1129
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:35,280
sitting in SL3

1130
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:37,119
R uh that preserves

1131
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,640
this

1132
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,480
that's just the definition of this group

1133
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,960
and a somewhat non-trivial fact is that

1134
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:45,359
this is a large group. It's not you know

1135
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:49,839
it's not the identity.

1136
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:53,839
Um, okay. And so you could use lambda,

1137
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:57,960
but you could also use

1138
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:57,960
any of these guys.

1139
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,000
So you could use the the lattice lambda,

1140
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,319
but you could also change coordinates by

1141
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,640
anybody in so 21. So you get a lot of

1142
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:10,799
other lises and you can use any of these

1143
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,440
lises and it's equivalent to the

1144
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:17,680
original problem.

1145
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:20,480
Okay. So now over here this orbit h

1146
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,240
this is going to be so one and n is

1147
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,480
going to be three in in this particular

1148
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,039
application

1149
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,680
and this initial point little x is going

1150
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:33,200
to be our lambda and so we can use any

1151
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:35,520
lambda in this whole thing.

1152
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,240
Okay, so now it matters like who is in

1153
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:42,480
this orbit

1154
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:44,559
and if the orbit was dense, so then

1155
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,920
lambda is allowed to be basically any

1156
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,440
lattice. Um and uh okay and then once

1157
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,200
you're allowed once lambda could be

1158
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,319
basically any lattice, then maybe it's

1159
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:57,440
believable that um that Q of lambda

1160
01:07:54,319 --> 01:08:00,799
should behave in a nice way. Or on the

1161
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,039
other hand u maybe maybe this orbit is

1162
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:05,280
quite a bit smaller and there are only a

1163
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,640
few special lambdas in the orbit and

1164
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,200
then it's not so clear what's going to

1165
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:12,640
happen.

1166
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:15,520
Okay. So that is how this setting setup

1167
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:17,520
in homogeneous dynamics occurs in a

1168
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,520
natural way in this number theory

1169
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:24,120
application and there are there are more

1170
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,120
applications also in a similar sphere.

1171
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:30,799
Okay. Um,

1172
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,199
now what does it have to do with

1173
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:36,199
projection theory?

1174
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:36,199
Um,

1175
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:42,960
[Applause]

1176
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:45,839
all right. So there are lots of

1177
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,279
different subgroups uh h there and this

1178
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,600
problem actually behaves in really

1179
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,480
different ways for different subgroups

1180
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:57,920
and the subgroups where there are strong

1181
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:59,359
theorems are uh are unipotent subgroups.

1182
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,400
Let me just write an example of a

1183
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:07,520
unipotent subgroup. So let's say we have

1184
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:10,319
SL and R and our group our group H but

1185
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:14,880
I'll call it U for unipotent is the

1186
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:17,040
group that looks like this.

1187
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,679
Right? So you have all ones on the

1188
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,679
diagonal. You have one guy in the upper

1189
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,400
right hand corner called T which is not

1190
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:27,679
one and everything else is zero. So this

1191
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,520
is a subgroup u and this is one that is

1192
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,920
behaved particularly nicely for this

1193
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,560
problem.

1194
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:38,159
Okay. What is nice about it? Let's also

1195
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:43,080
let's also just for example we work with

1196
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:43,080
SL2R. So U is just this

1197
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,279
right.

1198
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:54,239
Okay. So what I'd like to do is I'd like

1199
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:58,000
to take so let's say UT is one T 01.

1200
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:59,760
Um, and so I'm in principle interested

1201
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,679
in the infinite orbit, but I'm going to

1202
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,640
I'm sort of interested in the asmtoic

1203
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:08,640
behavior. So I'm going to I want to

1204
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:13,239
study the set of u subt

1205
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,239
where t goes in some range.

1206
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,000
Okay. Um,

1207
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,480
cool.

1208
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So what's important about this structure

1209
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:28,480
is that it interplays very nicely with a

1210
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,880
different uh matrix.

1211
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,960
So suppose now that little a is the

1212
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:37,600
diagonal matrix

1213
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:39,600
um little a r maybe is e to the r 0 e to

1214
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:43,600
the minus r.

1215
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:46,640
So that's sub 2 r also.

1216
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:52,640
And the nifty thing about this is that

1217
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:58,199
little a r u t little a minus r

1218
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,199
is u e to the r t.

1219
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,120
And so

1220
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:12,000
um

1221
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:15,199
right

1222
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,719
so I can take utx

1223
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:23,280
where t just goes from zero to one and

1224
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:25,920
then I can apply a to it many times and

1225
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,800
a

1226
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,159
a inverse to it a a1 let's say many

1227
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:36,440
times and a1 inverse many times

1228
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:36,440
and this thing is now

1229
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:42,199
say we do this n times

1230
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,480
that that

1231
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,600
so in other words in order to study this

1232
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,600
thing I start with that which is quite

1233
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,000
innocent looking

1234
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,600
so that's just like a nice segment that

1235
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:04,400
I can draw in my manifold and then I I

1236
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,719
do this operation of conjugating by a

1237
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,600
and I keep conjugating by a and

1238
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,880
eventually I get this thing. So to

1239
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,000
understand this thing I just it's

1240
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,120
important it's what's just important to

1241
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,450
understand what happens when we

1242
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:25,229
conjugate by a

1243
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:25,229
[Applause]

1244
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,679
Okay. So what happens when we conjugate

1245
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,679
by a.

1246
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:55,760
All right. Um

1247
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:59,199
um All right. So the conjugation map

1248
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:01,760
conjugation by a,

1249
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:04,719
it takes our

1250
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,880
homogeneous space to itself.

1251
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:10,840
Um, but if you look at a little piece of

1252
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,840
the homogeneous space,

1253
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:16,239
take a little box here,

1254
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,600
then some of these directions will be

1255
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:19,280
stretched and some of them will be

1256
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,440
contracted.

1257
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,400
So

1258
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,400
get maybe something

1259
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:40,440
Okay. Um,

1260
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,440
and now

1261
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,159
so let's say let's say our orbit is

1262
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:48,080
yellow.

1263
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:50,640
So we've we've done this a few times. So

1264
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,560
we have some piece of orbit.

1265
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,679
Um, and now we want to see what's going

1266
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:59,840
to happen to the orbit. Uh, well, some

1267
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:02,560
of the some piece of it got squashed.

1268
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:07,760
Um,

1269
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:13,760
so okay. Um so it it depends upon this

1270
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:15,920
orbit and then um if the if the if two

1271
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,000
strands here are separated by a

1272
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,520
direction that's the squash direction

1273
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,159
then they'll end up closer together

1274
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,520
here. And if they're in a direction

1275
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,199
separated by a direction that doesn't

1276
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,280
get squashed then they'll stay far

1277
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:30,000
apart.

1278
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,600
Um

1279
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,600
um

1280
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:38,320
so so in this box there is a direction

1281
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,840
so this is a box is B and there's a

1282
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,840
direction

1283
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:48,199
D subB

1284
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:48,199
direction in B that gets contracted.

1285
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,400
It's not quite true but it's almost like

1286
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:58,080
this box gets completely flattened. It's

1287
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,440
almost like the box is being projected

1288
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,360
to something lower dimensional

1289
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:05,600
projection.

1290
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:08,560
Okay. Um, and these guys go through a

1291
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:12,280
bunch of boxes.

1292
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,280
So here's B2,

1293
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:22,679
B1, B2, and so on. And um the direction

1294
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,679
DBJ is is changing,

1295
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,920
right? So um so you can choose

1296
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:31,840
coordinates so that the direction of

1297
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:33,440
these orbits is a coordinate axis and

1298
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,600
then the direction that's getting

1299
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,840
squashed is changing. So it's sort of

1300
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:41,960
like as you go along here there are

1301
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,960
projections in different directions.

1302
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:48,480
Okay. Um

1303
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:50,239
so

1304
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,600
right so that's let's call this

1305
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:57,760
conjugation map fee. So fe restricted to

1306
01:15:53,600 --> 01:16:01,360
B is sort of like a projection

1307
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,120
and changing B

1308
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:06,120
is sort of like looking at different

1309
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,120
projections.

1310
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,920
Um so we have one set of orbits but they

1311
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,000
pass through a bunch of boxes and so

1312
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,000
we're applying different projections to

1313
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
them.

1314
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,760
Okay. So this is roughly how projection

1315
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,440
theory comes into understanding how

1316
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:29,480
these orbits look like which has

1317
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,480
applications in different areas.

1318
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,280
Okay.

1319
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,880
Okay. So I guess I mostly talked about

1320
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,280
about this one.

1321
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,040
Um

1322
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,560
uh but it was the one that we hadn't

1323
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:50,040
talked about and I thought I should say

1324
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,040
something about it.

1325
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,040
have just a couple minutes. Should we

1326
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,640
It's almost spring break. Maybe we

1327
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,239
should take a break. We should just stop

1328
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,679
early.

1329
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,679
Yeah, let's do that. So, let's stop

1330
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,000
there. I wish you a very nice and

1331
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:07,239
restful and fun spring break and I will

1332
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,239
see you afterwards.
