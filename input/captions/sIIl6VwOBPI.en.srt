00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,599
Hi everyone. Um, biomedical imaging data

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
sets can exceed hundreds of terabytes.

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,400
So, computer vision algorithms operate

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
on them one chunk at a

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,920
time. There's extensive work in

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,920
multiscale representations of image

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
content, but is far less common to use

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
lowresolution information to guide how

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,519
the algorithm queries high resolution

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,760
information. We were inspired by uh the

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
cascade detector framework in face

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,480
detection. So we applied this framework

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
to biomedical

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,760
microscopy. We constructed a statistical

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,640
model to analyze the performance

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,800
trade-offs uh under such a framework and

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,760
we confirmed in a variety of public data

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,399
sets that cascade detectors can detect

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,760
sparse objects um in a fraction of the

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,160
time as their single resolution

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,640
counterparts with little to no uh

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,360
decreases in accuracy. So, hope to see

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,360
you at poster 23.

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,159
Thank you. Up next is Salvatore.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
Hi, I'm Salvo. I am a post-docctoral

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,960
researcher at the Overstart Lab at Dana

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,759
Farber Cancer Institute. Currently,

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,240
acute leukemia diagnostics relies on

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,799
multiple tests that are time and

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,720
resource intensive. We developed a

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
framework for rapid epigenomic

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
classification of acute leukemia using

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,400
DNA mutilation, machine learning and

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,320
nanopore sequencing. And we validated

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,439
our approach in both retros

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,920
retrospective and prospective cases even

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,600
doing realtime

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,159
classification. Uh we are shifting acute

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,320
leukemia diagnostics from several days

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,119
to hours. If you're curious, you want to

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,240
know more, please find me at poster 24.

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
Thank you.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,320
Up next we have Utsavv.

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,320
Thanks. Hi. So my name is Utsv. I'm a

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,240
postto here at the Ericon Schmidt Center

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,560
and at my poster poster number 25 I'm

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,000
going to present our algorithm Gaston an

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,840
interpretable deep learning algorithm

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
for learning topographic maps of gene

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
expression. So similar to when you're

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
hiking you have a topographic map of

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,520
like uh a mountain where each point

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
denotes the height. We derived these

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
topographic maps of tissue slices where

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
at every point in space we have a

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
coordinate that we call the isoepth. Um

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,200
and this uh topographic map is based on

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,800
this new mathematical model of spatial

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,640
gradients um in sparse and

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
highdimensional data. And using these

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,879
topographic maps we can do things like

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,800
finding spatial trajectories of cells um

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,560
inside tissues, finding spatial gene

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
expression patterns that separate

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,959
different um gene patterns in cancer and

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
finding spatial gradient patterns in

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
other tissues like the liver and

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,519
intestine. And so come to poster 25 if

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,519
you're interested. Thanks.

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,680
Thank you. Running right along. Seb,

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,680
you're up next.

72
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,319
Good morning. I'm Seb. Um so this

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,959
project started with a simple

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,640
observation that um cell annotation

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,480
models trained on atlas level data

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
sometimes struggle to generalize to new

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
data sets that they've not seen during

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,760
training. And I was wondering why this

79
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,840
is the case. And one of the things we

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,440
notice is that often those models are

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,360
trained with standard cross entropy

82
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,599
loss, meaning that they treat cell type

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
labels as being independent. Yet we know

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
that cell types are actually not

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
independent. They follow a hierarchical

86
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
structure. And we were wondering how can

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,440
we modify this loss function to encode

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
this relationship between cell types. Uh

89
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,720
so we came up with a mathematical

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,120
formula for that. And we've applied it

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,360
across models of increasing complexity

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,200
from a linear one to an MLP to more

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
sophisticated transformer. And what we

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,880
see is an improvement on their

95
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,360
performances. Thank you.

96
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,080
[Applause]

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,080
Next we have

98
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,280
my hi.

99
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:03,120
So hi. So we use single cell data along

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,560
with the spatial data and we have

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,680
produced a wonderful uh rag

102
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,840
or wonderful rag or regional agency

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,440
graph showing that the PMC's that are

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,560
the foundational bone of the development

105
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,919
of skeleton in sea

106
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,880
chains do have a special patterning code

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,360
and For

108
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:37,880
more and for more insights, please do

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,880
join me at poster number 27. Thank you.

110
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,240
Thank you. Welcome Navami.

111
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,199
Hi everyone. My name is Navami and I'm

112
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,199
in the MarkX lab where we're interested

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,360
in modeling how mutations to viral

114
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
proteins impact different aspects of its

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,759
fitness including ability to infect a

116
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,080
host cell, replicate or escape a host

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
antibbody. And in this project, we're

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,680
studying the best modeling approaches to

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,520
apply to 40 um pandemic threat viral

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,320
pathogens that have been identified by

121
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,360
the WH as a priority for research and

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,840
intervention. Um to do this we curate 50

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,240
deep mutational scanning assays covering

124
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,000
um a range of viral proteins and we

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
assess the performance of models that

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,440
fall broadly into two categories.

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,240
Alignment based models and protein

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,160
language models. From this we identify

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
confidence metrics based on the quality

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,639
of input data that are predictive of

131
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,560
model performance. And we use these

132
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,880
metrics to highlight pandemic threat

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,960
viruses that are that critically require

134
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,360
additional sequence or structural data.

135
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,240
Um if you'd like to more see more um

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,240
come to poster 28.

137
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,919
Thank you. Up next is

138
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,479
Ye. So genetic variations and its

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
interaction with the environmental cues

140
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,960
are all contributing to the development

141
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,759
of the metabolic diseases and these

142
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,080
effects are highly associated with the

143
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,479
adocides dysfunction.

144
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,720
So in order to explore the fundamental

145
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,919
mechanisms as well as to link the

146
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,880
genetics to biology uh we performed uh

147
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,039
we leverage our population scale solut

148
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,919
gene bank to perform the put natural

149
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,000
genetic variation screen in 118 donor

150
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,080
adocide villages under disease related

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,479
stimulations and as well as under the uh

152
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,880
uh single cell resolution. So we will be

153
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,440
able to identify hundreds to thousands

154
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,199
of uh sales state and the context

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,039
specific eqtls with potential links that

156
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,919
link to our uh adopite uh adopite

157
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:46,800
function. Uh we also will be able to map

158
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,639
the distinct cell states and their

159
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,319
stimulations to the relevant disease

160
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,479
heritability. We also observed uh the

161
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,800
pornogenic disease risk is associated

162
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,080
with adogenesis levels. Uh my name is

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,639
Iwang. Uh I'm a a posttock from Manina

164
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Clauser lab. So come and chat with me uh

165
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,520
at the post 29 if you are interested.

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,520
Thank you.

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,080
Thank you. Up next is RT.

168
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,160
Hello everybody. Um so as we know that

169
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,800
GVS

170
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,440
associates genotype variation with

171
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,240
phenotype and if you have uh uh data

172
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,880
sets with gene expression and genotype

173
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,520
you can predict gene expression

174
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,759
variation using uh genotype variation

175
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,039
across individuals. So if you integrate

176
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,680
the two essentially you can associate uh

177
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,160
genotype driven gene expression with a

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,360
phenotype. And as Angel pointed this

179
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,000
that ancestry uh background ancestral

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,960
background of people in these cohorts

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,759
could have an impact on uh observing

182
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,520
these relationships. So we train uh Grex

183
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,319
models on uh different ancestries uh for

184
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,360
brain tissue and integrate that with

185
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,440
mismatch ancestry gses of psychiatric

186
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,160
disorders. If you want to learn more on

187
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,100
how that helps, come to poster 30. Thank

188
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,520
you.

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,240
[Applause]

190
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,240
Up next is Anu.

191
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,599
Hi everyone, I'm Anu as final year CPSD

192
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
student at Georgia Tech. So humans like

193
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,919
to whisper to their close friends. Turns

194
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,320
out cells do the same. We present cell

195
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,760
whisper uh inference of contact mediate

196
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,839
cell signaling from spatial

197
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,240
transcrytoics data set. There are two

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,200
main innovations. First uh it has

199
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,360
stronger confounder awareness leading to

200
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
much lower false positive rates and

201
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
second we are the first to study gap

202
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,440
junction communication which is very

203
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,680
important especially in brains and there

204
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
are other we als we saw exciting results

205
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,640
on mouse brain and pathogenesis of

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,880
Alzheimer and we are the first to have a

207
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,600
novel latent variable model that works

208
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,480
directly at the quadriplet level. So see

209
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,000
you at uh poster number 30 uh 31 and

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,990
let's discuss and collaborate. Thank

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,120
you.

212
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:15,040
[Applause]

213
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,959
Thank you. Up next is V.

214
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Hi everyone. I'm a post-doal fellow at

215
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,640
the Schmidt Center. So this work is

216
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,880
about identifying cancer drug

217
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,399
combinations that work synergistically.

218
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
So this means that their joint effect

219
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,640
kills more cancerous cells than when

220
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,040
administered independently. Antagonism

221
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,279
is the opposite effect. So combination

222
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
therapy is a bedrock of cancer care. But

223
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,120
we just don't know what these do

224
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,040
response surfaces look like. Instead,

225
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,399
what we have access to are these coarse

226
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,160
cell viability assays on a fixed grid of

227
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,800
concentrations per uh for a chosen uh

228
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,560
drug pairs. Uh the theory of bliss

229
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,320
independence says that two drugs just

230
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,760
don't interact. So basically their joint

231
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,560
effect is just the sum of the individual

232
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,320
effects. As for the model, we uh

233
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,560
represent we mathematically represent

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
the dose response surface as the sum of

235
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,000
this bliss independence deterministic uh

236
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
effect plus a nonlinear unknown uh

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
interaction surface that we model with

238
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
Gaussian processes. What makes this

239
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,839
entire model multitask is that we take

240
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,640
these grid concentrations, we we we

241
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,200
flatten and stack them column-wise per

242
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
cancer cell line, per drug drug pair in

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
this gigantic matrix and then we model

244
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680
across columns and rows leveraging cross

245
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
coariance between uh cancer cell lines

246
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,880
and drug pairs. In order to chat more,

247
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,880
I'll be at poster 32. Thank you so much.

248
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,040
Thank you. Up next is Max.

249
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,440
Hi everyone. I'm a PhD student here with

250
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,279
Caroline Shiva and we're interested in

251
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,480
mechano genomics. So as we age uh the

252
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,480
kind of physical properties of our

253
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
tissues change and in particular

254
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
fibroblasts that reside in our tissue

255
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
can kind of sense and respond to changes

256
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,079
in mechanical signals thanks to a

257
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,000
signaling transduction pathways. These

258
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,760
signaling transduction pathways kind of

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
induce changes in gene expression which

260
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,160
kind of lead to cell state transitions.

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
And remarkably, fibroblasts are actually

262
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,839
quite plastic and they can kind of give

263
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
rise to diverse phenotypes. This kind of

264
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,880
phenotypic phenotypic diversity is

265
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,560
actually quite interesting because it

266
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,040
kind of suggests there's some underlying

267
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,320
like gene regular mechanism that kind of

268
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,360
govern cell fate decisions. And so we

269
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,120
were kind of thinking about how

270
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
fibroblasts adapt to the tissue

271
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,720
environment. And so what we observe is

272
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,480
that kind of uh cells in different

273
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
tissue contexts actually have different

274
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,200
3D chrome constructures. And so

275
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
basically what we're proposing in this

276
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,640
project is a pathway level mechanism of

277
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
gene regulation through which 3D

278
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,240
interimal contacts po cell state. So if

279
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
you're interested please see me at

280
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
poster

281
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,880
33. Next we have Tara.

282
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,959
Hello. I'm Tara. I'm a first year postto

283
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,760
fellow management center. Um and our

284
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,720
poster is about um how to learn how

285
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,399
dynamic DNA regulation affects sulfate

286
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,959
as you heard a little bit about before.

287
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,560
And uh we want to learn the regulatory

288
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,600
interactions as well as the trajectories

289
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,279
that the cells are on. Um and we wanted

290
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
a framework that would link these

291
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,480
different measurements in this case DNA

292
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
and RNA measurements uh through their

293
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,959
physical interactions but also give us a

294
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,079
way to assess uncertainty and our

295
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,880
different hypotheses of different

296
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,680
mechanisms in the system. Um so the idea

297
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,000
was to combine an explicit structure of

298
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,480
so RNA processing kinetics with flexible

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,480
machine learning. um so that we could

300
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,320
learn potential DNA based regulation

301
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
over time, how that affects the

302
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,079
downstream RNA processing and then where

303
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,240
your cells in your system are along the

304
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,600
potential trajectories. So if this is

305
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,440
interesting to you, please come by

306
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,360
poster

307
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,920
[Applause]

308
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,920
34. Next we have

309
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,000
Dora. Hello everyone. I'm Dora and I'm a

310
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,399
um postal and shim center. So um today I

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,160
want to u present a work that is

312
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,920
basically a model that we believe

313
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,399
actually nerves how cell interacts and

314
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,240
fally assemble into tissues. So we take

315
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,800
this self-supervised approach in which

316
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,800
we mask some cells and we ask the model

317
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,519
to use the unmask cells information to

318
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,839
predict this unmask cells cell types and

319
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,200
on top of that on top of that sorry uh

320
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,440
we actually come up with this

321
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
hierarchical model in which each single

322
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,839
layer you can think of as representing

323
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
some spatial units of different

324
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,000
resolution from single cell couple of

325
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,560
cells to tissue modules made up of

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,959
thousands of cells and we then optimal

327
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,959
interactions within each single layer as

328
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,720
well as across different resolutions and

329
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,959
finally get the output at the cell

330
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
level. So it turned out this model works

331
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,120
uh pretty well as shown in the bottom we

332
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,760
see that actually for example for this

333
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,760
uh for this tissue patch even though we

334
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,839
uh ask the model to only use 20% of the

335
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,839
information it can reconstruct 80% of

336
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,680
the cells accur accurately. So if you

337
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,560
wanted to learn more, find me and poster

338
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,560
certified. Thanks.

339
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
Next we have

340
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:03,639
Mining. Hello everyone. I'm Minshing, a

341
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,399
PhD student from UPAN applied

342
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,720
mathematics. So I will introduce our

343
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,040
project, a unified model for self

344
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,279
segmentation and classification. So

345
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,959
Selta classification annotation uh is a

346
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,000
important uh task for the spatial armies

347
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,120
data analysis current methods usually

348
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
based on the two-step approach which is

349
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,480
the self segmentation followed by the

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,160
cell tai annotation. However such

351
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,680
approach will let the full semantic

352
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,839
comprehensive

353
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,279
understanding of the tissue images. So

354
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,639
we propose a model called cellotype an

355
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,600
end to end transformerbased model for

356
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,000
cell annotation with three highlight

357
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,279
features the improved precision wide

358
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,639
applicability and multiscale

359
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,120
capabilities. So if you are interesting

360
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,160
in the segmentation or annotation of the

361
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,279
imaging based spatial or data welcome to

362
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,470
the poster number 37 for discussion.

363
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,120
Thank you.

364
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:15,079
[Applause]

365
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,079
Thank you. Up next is Yuni.

366
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,199
Hi, my name is Yuni. I'm a um third year

367
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,240
PhD in UCS MIT. Um I'm here to talk

368
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,959
about um uh like trajectory inference.

369
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,120
So what we do is um we know we want to

370
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,519
know uh how what's driven single cells

371
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
RNA change but we cannot track any

372
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,839
single cell because we have to kill it

373
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,760
to see what's inside. Um one of the

374
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,519
often used method is so called

375
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,079
shreddinger bridge or dynamic optimal

376
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,680
transport. Um the idea there is to let

377
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,160
let's learn the trajectory that that

378
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,920
most close to a brain motion. But if

379
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,160
shinger himself is here he will oppose

380
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,079
that because he actually written that on

381
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,519
what life feed upon is negative entropy.

382
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,800
So you cannot do the minimum entropy

383
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,880
thing. So what we do is we relax this

384
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,199
assumption of everything has to look

385
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
like a brain emotion and we ask for

386
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,279
things to look close to a family of

387
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,079
reference which could be biologically

388
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,399
informed and in many uh benchmarking

389
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,639
tasks we outperform the existing method.

390
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,639
Thank you.

391
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,680
Thank you. Up next is Maria.

392
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,759
Hi everyone. I'm Maria. I'm a second

393
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,759
year PhD student uh postdoctoral at the

394
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,519
at Smith center. Well uh the the idea is

395
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,839
that here we are interested in

396
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,639
identifying molecular qu quantitative

397
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,160
trait loi. The question is how can we

398
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,440
use gene expression in order to

399
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,320
understand complex trait trait genetics

400
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,560
and our approach here is going to be uh

401
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,800
through expression quantitative trait

402
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,399
locus which is a method in order to

403
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,040
identify associations between

404
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:57,519
genotype and expression levels. So in

405
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,320
our case we're interested in the uh

406
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,319
genetic variation uh which is going to

407
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,199
be accounted for as snips also known as

408
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,240
uh single nucleotide polymorphisms and

409
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,880
we wish to identify their pairwise

410
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,400
association with z expression variation

411
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,360
in order to see to learn which snips are

412
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,360
actually uh important and tend to

413
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,679
regulate this uh kind of variation. So

414
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,240
that's the problem from the biological

415
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,400
point of view. But of course uh there

416
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,480
are quite a lot of cavits. Uh one of

417
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,120
them is the fact that we have high

418
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,440
dimensional data. Usually the number of

419
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,600
individuals is of orders of hundreds to

420
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,480
thousands and then uh gene expression

421
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,880
levels tens of thousands and snips

422
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,320
hundreds of thousands to millions. So

423
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,919
it's quite hard to uh kind of do that in

424
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,160
an elegant statistical manner. Uh we are

425
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,080
overall we are interested towards uh

426
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,679
doing the uh the task of variable

427
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,160
selection. That means that we are

428
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,640
interested in identifying which of those

429
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,960
snips are actually regulatory with

430
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,600
respect to the gene expression levels.

431
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,000
And another uh interesting and I guess

432
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,400
that it's uh well known to most of you

433
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,120
uh another keyword here keyword here is

434
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,000
pleotropy in the sense that there's this

435
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:25,280
two-way association in between varants

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,280
and uh gene expression levels. So that's

437
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,039
us and next is

438
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,799
Sophie. Hello, my name is Sophie. I'm a

439
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,720
student at the University of Toronto and

440
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm excited to share yeastiff, a model

441
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,840
that learns how cells divide. So we

442
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,760
start with live cell images of yeast um

443
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
each visualizing a specific protein in

444
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,120
the cell. And kind of our fundamental

445
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,280
question we're trying to answer is what

446
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,000
can we teach a diffusion model to learn

447
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,200
about the cell cycle process allowing it

448
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,400
to generalize to new and untested

449
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,720
conditions. Specifically, we're focused

450
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,720
on multi-roin visualization which is

451
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,880
challenging to do in live cells due to

452
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,480
spectral overlap. Now, as you can see on

453
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,799
the right, we are able to generate

454
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,640
highly realistic single cell images, but

455
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,200
more interestingly, we're able to

456
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
generalize to multi-roin cell images,

457
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
which is something the model has never

458
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
seen before. And we're currently scaling

459
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,640
this to many, many more proteins. And we

460
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
kind of hope this work can serve as a

461
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,640
visualization tool to help kind of

462
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,120
researchers and people better understand

463
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,600
the cell cycle process and also help

464
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,039
identify or test new hypotheses without

465
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,240
having to run every experiment in the

466
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,600
lab. And if you're interested in

467
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,559
learning more on how we did this, you

468
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,559
can find me at poster 42.

469
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,720
Thank you. Our last speaker will be

470
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,520
Petar. Okay. So, um, hi everyone. I'm

471
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,799
Petar. I'm uh postoc at the Schmidt

472
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,799
center and uh in the Gats lab. So, most

473
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,200
of the transcrytoic studies that we're

474
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,160
that we discuss about generally is

475
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,200
concerning the coding genes. um and

476
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,960
often um other molecules are overlooked

477
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,760
and some of those molecules are small

478
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,760
non non-coding RNAs and they can have

479
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,919
different kinds of roles. They can be

480
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,400
involved in translation which is the

481
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,679
tRNA and it's very very well known. Um

482
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,480
they can be involved in splicing uh or

483
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,280
guarding um guarding the the integrity

484
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,120
of the genome during u um in germline

485
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,039
cells. Um and most importantly uh the

486
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,000
the most known ones are micronas which

487
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,039
are important in gene regulation. And so

488
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,240
um the GTEx project um sequenced a lot

489
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,360
of um um a lot of different tissues ac

490
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:41,039
across many different individuals. Um so

491
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,400
um and that used polya capture. Uh and

492
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:47,440
then um then for the same donors uh so

493
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,520
the these are 9 900 donors across 54

494
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,440
tissue types and a total of 20 almost

495
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,559
20,000 samples we now have subset of

496
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,760
them with a different protocol that uh

497
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,320
profiles small uh non-coding RNAs. And

498
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,760
so uh with these kinds of overlap

499
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,520
between the two data sets, we can look

500
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,159
at one of the highlights is that we can

501
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,840
look at genetic regulation

502
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,880
um of small RNA expression. And then we

503
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,919
can also look at how um the uh

504
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,080
regulatory effect of a EQL on a small

505
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,240
RNA can propagate to a coding gene for

506
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,640
example and then subsequently to a

507
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,520
complex trait like a G-W was trait. Um

508
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,080
and then um here we have an example in

509
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,720
thyroid where uh two micronas are

510
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,120
regulated in SIS by a variant and then

511
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,120
through um kind of um instrumental

512
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,919
variable analysis collocicalization and

513
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,640
other um evidence we can show that that

514
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,039
these micronas are in actually mediating

515
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,559
the trans effect of the of the snip on

516
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,960
the coding genes that are that are all

517
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,679
involved in growth. And finally we can

518
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,360
also show that that um that this all

519
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,720
makes sense when we actually look at the

520
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,320
effect of the snip on um growth g was

521
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,919
like kite. So for more uh more vignettes

522
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,039
like this and more overview of this data

523
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,039
set please come to poster 43.
