00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,960
Good evening everyone.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm Kai Langley, director of development

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,640
for the MIT libraries and on behalf of

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,600
our director, Dr. Chris Berg, I welcome

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,320
you to this evening's fall MIT Reads

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,080
2025 presentation.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
The libraries are an engine for

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,519
creating, sharing, and safeguarding

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
knowledge at the institute and beyond.

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,040
The libraries work to improve the

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
world's collective knowledge by

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,920
equipping current and future scholars

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,239
with the best content and the skills to

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,600
use it, whether examining medieval

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,920
manuscripts or managing research data.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,719
As part of this work, our MIT Reads

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,120
program invites the MIT community to

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,840
hear from leading authors and to engage

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,920
in solution centered discourse on some

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,359
of the world's most complex challenges

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,000
facing our campus, the nation, and the

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,080
world. Thank you so much for joining us

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,640
this evening. This webinar is being

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,200
livereamed and recorded. It will be

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,080
available on the MIT Reeds website in

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,880
the near future. A very special thanks

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,680
to all the MIT staff who have made this

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,320
presentation possible, including Sylvia

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Figureroa Ortiz, Ya Fuja Ross, Julia

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,280
Lanigan, Emily Kramer, Marcela Tam,

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,520
Lauren Fairman, Brigham Fay, Ned Wolf,

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,759
and Shannon Hunt.

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,159
We also greatly appreciate our community

34
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,479
partners at the MIT Press that both

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,880
published tonight's selection and have

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,520
copies of the book available for sale at

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,840
their MIT Press website.

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
As this is a webinar, you'll find that

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,720
the chat is disabled and all parties are

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,799
muted. You will be able to submit

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,479
questions and comments for our guests

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,720
throughout the presentation on your

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,560
screen and staff are recording them

44
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,240
offscreen for discussion when we reach

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,600
the Q&A portion of this presentation.

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,439
In a moment, I will provide

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,360
introductions for our guests and our

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
author will share a few brief insights

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,000
into why he created our MIT Reed

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,200
selection followed by a discussion with

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
the author and our moderator.

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,040
Without further delay, allow me to

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
introduce this evening's author and

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,800
moderator. On disinformation: How to

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,360
fight for truth and protect democracy by

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Lee McIntyre. Couldn't be a more timely

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
book for discussion today. Lee is a

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,840
research fellow at the Center for

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
Boston University and a senior adviser

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,360

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,760
University. He has also served as a

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,080

The author of 10 books, five of which

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,959
have been published by the MIT Press on

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
Disinformation: How to Fight for Truth

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,920
and Protect Democracy is best described

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,480
as, and I quote, a powerful pocket-size

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,879
citizens guide on how to fight back

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,400
against the disinformation campaigns

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,280
that are imperiling American democracy."

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,440
End quote. In conversation with Lee this

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,680
evening is Rebecca Larson, an assistant

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,239

Rights at the University of Cambridge.

86
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,840
An early career media sociologist, her

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,159
work uncovers and analyzes

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
underststudied media ecosystems,

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,040
particularly those with insightful

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,640
relations to the traditional press and

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,040
concepts of this misinformation.

92
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,680
Lee and Rebecca, thank you so much for

93
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,599
joining us. Now, Lee, we welcome hearing

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
your insights and we're turn turning it

95
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,319
over to you.

96
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,920
>> Great. Thank you so much for the warm

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,599
introduction and uh thank you for

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,159
everybody who works so hard to make this

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,319
happen. I so wish that I could be there

100
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,040
in person and this could have been a an

101
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,280
in-person event. I managed to break the

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,600
L4 L5 in my back so I couldn't fly. So

103
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,360
uh it had to be converted to to a

104
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,240
virtual event and thank you to everybody

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,800
at MIT who worked so hard to uh to make

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,880
this event uh still possible so that we

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,759
could do it.

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,400
Um, when I was a teenager, really just

109
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,880
emerging as an independent reader, I

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,720
became fascinated with dystopian

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,960
fiction. 1984, Brave New World,

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Fahrenheit 451.

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,680
I don't know what it was about those

114
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,440
books, but they always struck me.

115
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
Something that I cared about was under

116
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,000
serious threat here, but the fact that

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,479
it was fiction made it somehow more

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,080
palatable. Yet the danger and warning

119
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,160
for the future never left me. As I look

120
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,560
back, I realize that in all three of

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,520
these books, not only are people and

122
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,280
entire societies under threat, but truth

123
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,080
itself.

124
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,080
More than this, the mechanism by which

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,639
people are oppressed begins with

126
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,600
hostility to truth and the written word.

127
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,639
Books are burned. Information goes down

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,039
the memory hole. The Bible is left in a

129
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,720
corner where it is motheaten and

130
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,280
forgotten.

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,600
Whatever books do exist are written and

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,199
produced by machines for public

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
entertainment.

134
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,000
The human mind is taken out of the

135
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,600
process either in the creation or the

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,080
consumption of books. We are distracted

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,320
with entertainment while the world

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,120
burns.

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,440
How do these things go together?

140
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,160
I think that what Orwell, Huxley, and

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,880
Bradbury were warning us about is

142
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
something that fascists learned early,

143
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
and these lessons are still being

144
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,199
practiced today. That control over a

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,680
population always starts with control

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,960
over information.

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,840
In our own era, we find words and people

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,759
again under assault. In a time when

149
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,280
practically the entire sum of human

150
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:29,680
knowledge is as close as our iPhones, we

151
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,479
are drowned in a sea of misinformation.

152
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
Yet, ironically, an important part of

153
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,479
this misinformation

154
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,479
is made up of people who the who deny

155
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,960
that misinformation the misinformation

156
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,360
problem even exists.

157
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,680
More and more we find hyperbolic

158
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,479
political rhetoric, usually coming from

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,280
the right, claiming that we live in an

160
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,039
era of great censorship,

161
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,720
that misinformation isn't really

162
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,120
definable

163
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,599
or is rare or may not even exist.

164
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,400
But how can all of these things be true

165
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,319
at the same time?

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,680
Everyone understands what true

167
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,919
censorship is. It's when information is

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,800
taken away, changed, destroyed, when

169
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,720
it's put down the memory hole.

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
It's what happens when school board

171
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
members in Florida want to ban certain

172
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,599
books or the Chinese government doesn't

173
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,919
allow its citizens access to certain

174
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,520
websites.

175
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
And this is the framework that some

176
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,840
right-wing members of Congress in the

177
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,840
United States have latched on to when

178
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,639
they don't like content moderation or

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,919
deplatforming that refuses to amplify

180
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,840
the kind of lies

181
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,599
that serve their political goals. Ask

182
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,560
yourself, who would defend the idea that

183
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,000
misinformation has a right to exist?

184
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,479
Someone who profits by it. That's who.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,680
They will defend misinformation as quote

186
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,000
alternative speech or recommend that one

187
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,960
should just let everyone speak and truth

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,759
will somehow magically rise to the top.

189
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,479
Yet loads of empirical work has shown

190
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,400
that this just isn't true.

191
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,960
That misinformation is more prevalent

192
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,360
now than ever. That it's having a

193
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,199
terrible effect on us. And that where

194
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,520
there's a competition between lies and

195
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,879
truth, lies almost always win.

196
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,759
To claim that the fight against

197
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,000
misinformation is censorship is to

198
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,479
misunderstand what the fight against

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,519
misinformation is really about, which is

200
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,760
the preservation of truth.

201
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,800
But more than this, I think that

202
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,040
disinformation is really itself a form

203
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,120
of censorship.

204
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,600
Do you remember that scene in Indiana

205
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,760
Jones and the Last Crusade where

206
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,560
Harrison Ford is finally found the Holy

207
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Grail? But he can't tell which one it is

208
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,080
because it's surrounded by a thousand

209
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,480
fakes.

210
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,040
That's the point of disinformation.

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,600
If you can't hide or destroy the truth,

212
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,360
you can cover it up with

213
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,040
There's always time to kill it later.

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
The goal of disinformation and

215
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,560
censorship are really the same, which is

216
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,720
to subvert the truth. Whether you

217
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,680
destroy the truth or surround it with a

218
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,640
hundred fakes, the outcome is the same.

219
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,120
People can't find it. And this is why I

220
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,279
believe that in our current era, even

221
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
when truthful information is all around

222
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,240
us, it is nonetheless the case that

223
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,160
truth has never been under greater

224
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,959
threat.

225
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,600
We live in an era in which, as one Wag

226
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,600
recently put it, the truth is behind a

227
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,800
payw wall and the lies are free.

228
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,320
In my 2018 book, Post-Truth, I defined

229
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,120
this notion as the political

230
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,399
subordination of reality.

231
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,440
In my 2023 book on disinformation,

232
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,160
I extend the story and explore how we

233
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,279
got into our current situation and what

234
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,680
we might be able to do about it.

235
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,959
Disinformation is a strategic tool that

236
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,839
is created by malign actors who seek to

237
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,880
weaponize and amplify false information

238
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,680
to form an army of believers so that

239
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,560
they can get what they want, money,

240
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,160
ideology, or power.

241
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
But the point isn't merely to get

242
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,680
someone to believe something false. It's

243
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,079
to dominate their reality so completely

244
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,959
that they're less likely to resist.

245
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,959
Indeed, in some cases, people may simply

246
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,720
give up.

247
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,920
The great political philosopher and

248
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,040
Holocaust historian Hannah Erent once

249
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,399
said this quote, "If everybody always

250
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,040
lies to you, the consequence is not that

251
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,160
you believe the lie, but rather that

252
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,079
nobody believes anything any longer. And

253
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,600
a people that no longer can believe

254
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,640
anything cannot make up its mind. It is

255
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,519
deprived not only of its capacity to act

256
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,440
but also of its capacity to think and to

257
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:14,160
judge. And with such a people, you can

258
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:18,399
then do what you please. End quote.

259
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,640
That last line is always gives me chills

260
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,200
because it makes explicit the connection

261
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,040
between disinformation and the threat to

262
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,720
democracy.

263
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,600
If you control the information that

264
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,839
someone hears, in some sense, you can

265
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
control their reality.

266
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,160
And when that happens, you make them

267
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,040
much more pliable for control through

268
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,399
autocracy, authoritarianism,

269
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,640
fascism, whatever you want to call it.

270
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,120
I think that repression, torture,

271
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,560
persecution, deportation,

272
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,720
incarceration, execution are the endgame

273
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,800
of this strategy.

274
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,000
But it always starts with targeting

275
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,320
trutht tellers and their power over the

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,560
written word.

277
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,519
Orwell, Huxley, and Bradley understood

278
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,000
this. Though each had different ways of

279
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,800
characterizing it, they were all talking

280
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,880
about the same thing. How the subversion

281
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
of truth is a necessary step in the

282
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,639
oppression of people.

283
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
And although they all presented this

284
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,079
within the context of fiction, the truly

285
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,560
frightening thing for me is that what I

286
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,000
saw presented in novels in my most

287
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:33,079
fevered dreams when I was a teenager are

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,079
now in danger of becoming reality.

289
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,760
That's all I have to

290
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,839
to say about that. and I would be more

291
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,120
than happy to

292
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,120
have a conversation with Rebecca.

293
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,920
>> Thank you, Lee, um, on multiple fronts

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,920
for showing up today despite all of the,

295
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,360
um, roadblocks, but also for writing

296
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,839
this book. It's so powerful, so focused

297
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,000
on galvanizing citizens. And as an

298
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,120
academic who's also who's often in the

299
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,959
weeds about um complexities and

300
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,760
specificities, it was very refreshing to

301
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,240
read a book that weaves that so well.

302
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,839
What can we do right now? But also here

303
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,880
are some empirical things that are

304
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,040
happening. Um so I'm going to start off

305
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,360
with a question that's directly

306
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,600
connected to the comments you just made.

307
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,160
Um, so in on disinformation, your 2023

308
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,000
book, you argue that disinformation

309
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,560
today isn't just confusion or error.

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,680
It's a deliberate campaign to create

311
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,480
deep distrust. It's strategic denialism

312
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,720
for political or ideological gain or for

313
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,279
profit, um, monetary profit as you

314
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,440
argue. Um, and this is an approach

315
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,839
that's different from some scholars and

316
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,839
journalists. He's just drawing a very um

317
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,959
sharp line between misinformation or

318
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,560
unintentionally circulated

319
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,240
problematic information and

320
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,360
disinformation, the intentional

321
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,360
falsehoods that you describe um being

322
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,839
spread for power or profits. You even go

323
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,720
so far as to call misinformation at one

324
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,959
point in your book a a euphemism. So um

325
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
why is that distinction so central to

326
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,199
your argument and do you think that

327
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,800
distinction still holds up two years

328
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,959
later and where we are now politically?

329
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,639
Great question. Yes, I do think it holds

330
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:29,279
up uh today more than ever because

331
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,279
I mean language is important. What you

332
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:36,560
call a problem matters for whether you

333
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:41,680
feel empowered to do something about it.

334
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,160
And I see this so much on cable news

335
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,079
when they even bother to talk about the

336
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,160
problem of miss or disinformation.

337
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,160
They prefer to use the term

338
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,120
misinformation

339
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,000
and I think that they do that because

340
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,399
well because the terms have become

341
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,440
politicized. Now you ask yourself who

342
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,399
politicized them you know who who didn't

343
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
want you to you know to to hear it one

344
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,480
way or the other. But the problem is

345
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,760
that the media

346
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,399
um tend to like the word misinformation

347
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,480
because it's this umbrella term that

348
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,920
gets them out of the problem of having

349
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,440
to talk about who's behind it.

350
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,079
>> Uh dis misinformation is a mistake. But

351
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,320
disinformation is a lie. And if there's

352
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,600
a lie, there has to be a liar. So the

353
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,160
minute they say disinformation,

354
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,560
then they have to say who the liar is

355
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,839
and what the liar hoped to get out of

356
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,519
it. And the problem is that if you

357
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
report on the problem as one of

358
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,639
misinformation, then it's just a

359
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,040
confusion, a mistake. But it's not often

360
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,360
a confusion or mistake. I mean, think

361
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,040
about if if something is misinformation,

362
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
then it could be cleared up by getting

363
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,120
evidence. You go, "Oh, really? Oh, I I

364
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,279
had heard it the other way. I I didn't

365
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,360
know, you know, I always thought that uh

366
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,800
you knowh corn snakes were dangerous,

367
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,480
but it turns out they're not. I was

368
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,440
misinformed.

369
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,639
Um I I would get mixed up which is

370
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,800
which. I don't I don't know. Is it a

371
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,560
king snake, coralnake, who who knows? Um

372
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
so

373
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,880
that's misinformation just kind of

374
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,120
accidental that that uh somebody hears

375
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,839
and they, you know, get it cleared up.

376
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:30,959
But disinformation is a plot and that's

377
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,639
a danger because

378
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,839
think about what you're empowered to do

379
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,360
if you hear that something is

380
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,680
misinformation.

381
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
What can you do? It's like a natural

382
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,199
disaster.

383
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,560
You know, hurricane's coming, put your

384
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,079
head down, you know, uh put some uh uh

385
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,800
you know, board up your windows. There's

386
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,040
really nothing you can do. But if the

387
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,120
problem is disinformation

388
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,000
then there is something you can do

389
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,959
because it is a plot. There are people

390
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,880
behind it. They have interests and you

391
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,120
can expose those interests and expose

392
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,120
the people

393
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:12,000
that really resonates again as an

394
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,240
academic who I I would say

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,559
more often I see in academia that we use

396
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,959
the term umbrella term misinformation.

397
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,919
>> Yeah. They're all mau disinformation

398
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,679
these days because of the sort of you

399
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,240
know social cultural political economy

400
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,160
texture around disinformation but it is

401
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,240
like in some ways very limiting when

402
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,799
it's when we're approaching this as like

403
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,720
what can we do um so

404
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,320
I think I also want to ask you another

405
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,960
question since you've brought up cable

406
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,960
news that's a great segue for us to talk

407
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
about another um

408
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,679
>> really useful framework work throughout

409
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,400
your book. Um

410
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,360
the three or I guess it's three groups

411
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,000
that you describe um and you break down

412
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,160
in terms of disinformation flow and

413
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,559
success in terms of um strategic

414
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,600
denialism. So the truth killers or

415
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,760
creators, the amplifiers, which cable

416
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,880
news would be one, and the believers.

417
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,799
So, can you walk us through what these

418
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,080
actors are, how they connect to each

419
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,760
other, and if we get to it, where you

420
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,960
think the real leverage points are for

421
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,840
change?

422
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,160
>> Sure. And I just want to apologize the

423
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,720
commotion behind me. My my uh

424
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,480
15-year-old German Shepherd, Gigi, uh

425
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,760
has decided to come in and join me. She

426
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,440
she hears me start to talk about

427
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,039
disinformation. She decides, "Oh, it's

428
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
nap time. I'm going to lay down on the

429
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,000
couch." So, you hear all that jingling.

430
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
That's that's what's going on behind me

431
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,720
there. You might have to pay the dog tax

432
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,640
at some point.

433
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,640
>> Wingman. Yeah. Um, okay. So,

434
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,600
when we're thinking about what to do

435
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,000
about the problem of disinformation,

436
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,720
it's important not to waste our time

437
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
because [laughter] the problem is so

438
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,400
great and, you know, our tools are sort

439
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,200
of limited or can be misused. I mean we

440
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,280
have to identify what we what we can do

441
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,760
and and you know put our efforts in the

442
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,080
right uh in the right direction.

443
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,919
So the reason I started I even have

444
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,440
chapters called the disinformers the

445
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,240
amplifiers the believers

446
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,559
if you think so how so how do you solve

447
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,240
this problem? Well I see that as a

448
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,960
pipeline it goes from the disinformers

449
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,039
to the amplifiers to the believers.

450
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,039
Can you get a disinformer to stop

451
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,440
creating disinformation?

452
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,320
By and large, not.

453
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,640
Why would they? Why would they stop? Uh

454
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,160
it's something that benefits them. I

455
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,559
mean, think about the cigarette

456
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,960
companies in the 1950s that created

457
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,559
disinformation about uh whether

458
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
cigarettes were addictive or were

459
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,160
dangerous for your health. They did that

460
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,320
for profit. How could you get them to

461
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,760
stop? Why would they stop? They they

462
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,520
didn't, you know, they didn't want to

463
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,600
stop. Um, sometimes disinformers are in

464
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,120
foreign countries and so no matter what

465
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,200
law you pass, you know, in the US,

466
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,440
you're just not going to stop them.

467
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,240
Disinformation with AI now is so easy to

468
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,880
create. I mean, you you're just you are

469
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
not going to be able to stop the supply

470
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,559
side of disinformation. It is it is

471
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,640
coming and it's going to be terrible. I

472
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:30,960
I just read the other day about uh Sora,

473
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,799
which is a new ver uh uh version of I

474
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,880
know version of from the people who

475
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,360
brought you chat GPT what they did for

476
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,520
text. Sora is going to do for video. So

477
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,320
you can put you know the face of

478
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,320
whomever you want into a video and have

479
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,320
them do whatever you want. Oh my

480
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,320
goodness. You know, well geez, how could

481
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,080
that go wrong? But I mean, the

482
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,080
possibilities for disinformation are

483
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,720
going to be endless in the hands of a

484
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,880
malign actor. And you you can't get

485
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,600
malign actors to stop doing malign

486
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,440
things because that's who they are. Turn

487
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,480
this telescope around. Look at the other

488
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,960
end, the believers.

489
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,799
believers have gotten the brunt of the

490
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,039
invective,

491
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,919
the hatred,

492
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,880
um the

493
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,880
name calling uh in what's going on in

494
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,520
the information war that is the United

495
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,520
States these days. Look what happened

496
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,320
during COVID. Look what happened, you

497
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,840
know, for for climate change. I wrote a

498
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
whole book on this called How to Talk to

499
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,080
a Science Denire. think making the

500
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,600
argument that you needed to talk and

501
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,000
that's even the word denier. That's

502
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,799
that's not good. That's name calling.

503
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,880
But you need to talk to people one on-

504
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,120
one to see if you can reach them. The

505
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,880
the the human contact, but you know what

506
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,400
I mean? It embarrasses me to say I wrote

507
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,240
a whole book on this, but it's not a

508
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
scalable solution to the information

509
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,360
problem. Though it may be the right

510
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,159
thing to do or the right thing to do for

511
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,080
science, but you know the huge problem

512
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,799
that we have today, it's it's not enough

513
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,200
because think of it this way. The people

514
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,200
who believe the lies are victims

515
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
and in some cases they're the people who

516
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,520
are the worse off. I mean because

517
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,679
they're not only amplifying

518
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,280
disinformation, which I suppose you can

519
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,960
make an academic argument at that point.

520
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,120
Is it still disinformation? Isn't it

521
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,760
misinformation? because they're not, you

522
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,440
know, doing it knowing it's false. Okay,

523
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,315
we could talk about that for a few

524
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,840
hundred years in a philosophy seminar,

525
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:35,360
[laughter]

526
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,919
>> but um, you know, they they are

527
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,760
they're dying of CO.

528
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,280
>> They're they're believing the lies about

529
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
whether they're microchips in the

530
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,080
vaccines and they a lot of them died of

531
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,600
CO. So, I mean, they're they're the

532
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,840
victims and victims deserve empathy

533
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,760
and yes, we should talk to them. It's

534
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,520
the human thing to do, but it's not

535
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,520
enough to solve the problem. I think

536
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,080
that the only way we're going to solve

537
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,640
this problem is to grab the the pipeline

538
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,440
and squeeze in the middle. The middle,

539
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,280
the amplifiers. Sometimes believers

540
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,000
amplify. Yes, they do. But what are the

541
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,559
tools of amplification? The tools of

542
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,200
amplification are

543
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:23,200
cable news, social media, um you know p

544
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,799
paid media. Uh it's you know th that

545
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,720
that those are going to be the areas

546
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,960
where we can uh do more and we really

547
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,080
you know it's it's sad to see the extent

548
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,559
to which they have crumbled under the

549
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,000
pressure to do something now saying that

550
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,840
because they can't do everything they're

551
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
going to do nothing. And I'm thinking

552
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,120
here of the Facebooks and Twitters of

553
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,840
the world um who just have kind of given

554
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,679
up on content moderation because they

555
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,240
they

556
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,400
I don't know. I don't really don't know

557
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,000
why.

558
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,280
>> Yeah. I I mean this is talking of pinch

559
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,960
points and the amplifiers. Um yeah, I

560
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,280
was wondering how you would if you

561
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,360
rewrote this book 2025

562
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,240
if you could write it like that. um

563
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,720
given what's happened with uh the third

564
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,240
party factchecking program at Facebook

565
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,600
with all the cow towering the

566
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,600
inauguration funding the line behind

567
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,159
Trump at the inauguration of tech

568
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,919
people. Do you think is there some way

569
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,240
that you would rewrite especially this

570
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,720
chapter on the amplifiers and that being

571
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,240
a particular pinch point for the

572
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,039
disinformation pipeline?

573
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,360
I I I wish

574
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,320
I mean I wish I could rewrite it because

575
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,320
the book was not successful enough you

576
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,080
know to to the scale of the problem. Um

577
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,320
I don't know what more I could have

578
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,360
said. I mean are there other things that

579
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,279
I could have said other avenues? Surely

580
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,600
I think there there would be I mean I

581
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,520
probably would have said more about you

582
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,480
know um

583
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,400
the profit motive of the amplifiers. I

584
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,000
mean the amplifiers,

585
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,400
>> if you think about it, you know, the the

586
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,880
the algorithms in social media or the

587
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,440
profit motive in in major media, even ma

588
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,159
in mainstream media, I mean, sometimes

589
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,679
you wonder why would they change either?

590
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,440
I mean, are they if if they know they're

591
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,200
doing something wrong and they do it

592
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,279
anyway, doesn't that make them

593
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,240
complicit? You know, isn't shouldn't

594
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:29,360
that be called out a little bit more

595
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,240
than uh than I did? Uh, so yeah, I I

596
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:37,440
probably would would uh uh say more

597
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:40,640
about that, but um it's hard because

598
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,880
it's a short book, but I really put

599
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,559
everything I had into it. And I don't

600
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,360
really know what more I could say

601
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,440
to solve that problem. There there is

602
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,080
one thing there is one thing that I

603
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,120
would say and and it's it's what people

604
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,039
ask me about now.

605
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,122
because we're up to our hips in fascism

606
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,240
now. It's not just a warning. It's here.

607
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:09,600
[clears throat]

608
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,919
>> Uh you know, uh I just read today that

609
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,919
um the the FBI has now increased by 300%

610
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,360
the number of people who are under

611
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,600
investigation for uh domestic terrorism.

612
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,080
And there are people on the left. There

613
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,080
are people who don't have quote American

614
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,960
values,

615
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,400
Christian values. I mean, is this going

616
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,960
to result in detentions? Am I going to

617
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,039
go to jail someday?

618
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,600
>> Um, you know, we're we're hip deep in

619
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,720
this already.

620
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,960
I think of Alexi Nali.

621
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,799
I mean, he was not hip deep. He was over

622
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,480
his head deep in an electoral

623
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,360
dictatorship, but he still told the

624
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,000
truth. Why did he do that? He did that

625
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,400
because he recognized that even one

626
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,520
voice for truth

627
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,760
is a thorn in the side and an

628
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,279
inspiration to all the other people in

629
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,320
society.

630
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,400
Telling the truth and amplifying the

631
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,559
truth is important. I didn't say enough

632
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,440
in the book about amplifying truth. I

633
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,279
talked about how not to amplify lies. I

634
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,799
didn't say enough about how to amplify

635
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,120
truth because the same cognitive bias

636
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,200
that helps people to believe something

637
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,400
when they hear it over and over and over

638
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,720
again when it's a lie, it works for true

639
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,000
information, too. So, the strategy that

640
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,440
I've been talking about more and more as

641
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,120
I go out on the road now is what should

642
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,520
we do? Tell the truth. Tell it over and

643
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,840
over from the largest platform that you

644
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,919
can find. That is the number one best

645
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,080
thing that you can possibly do in an

646
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,679
information war. Understanding that

647
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,679
you're putting your neck out when you do

648
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,679
so.

649
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,240
>> Yeah, I might use that to put on my more

650
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,799
like traditionally questioning academic

651
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,720
hat.

652
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,720
>> Sure. Um,

653
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
I think one thing that I looked for in

654
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,600
the book, and it's a short book and it

655
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,840
has a very big punch that you can't, you

656
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,760
know, put too much in there to get the

657
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,240
the force of that punch. Um, but one

658
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,919
thing I did wonder why it wasn't in

659
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,159
there was the political economy of

660
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,000
journalism at this point or some of the

661
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
amplifiers that are supposed to speak

662
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,120
truth.

663
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,480
you talked about things like both

664
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,440
sidesism, um false equivalencies, you

665
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,919
know, horse race type coverage of

666
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,320
political events. Um

667
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,919
but there is a discussion in scholarly

668
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:42,159
as well as more public circles that

669
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,320
a there's not really incentive for truth

670
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,919
speakers traditionally understood as

671
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,159
such to speak the truth and um b for

672
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,720
those of us who say do try to get a

673
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,399
platform and speak the truth our sort of

674
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,600
targets

675
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,159
might not align in terms of um

676
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,200
>> targeted ads like we're not pushing the

677
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,840
same sort of

678
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,559
>> emotionally identity bolstering language

679
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,320
or you know narratives. I hope you

680
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,880
understand where I'm going with this.

681
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,039
>> I do

682
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,919
>> we need to like maybe think about those

683
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,120
structural things in addition to the you

684
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,600
know

685
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,679
>> I I didn't emphasize that

686
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,279
>> as much as I maybe should have for a

687
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,399
couple of reasons. I mean it's a short

688
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,480
book but one is if there are structural

689
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,159
reasons why we're in that

690
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,399
>> situation

691
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,919
>> writing a kind of a short pmic and

692
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,480
explain to people what the structural

693
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,320
reasons are doesn't necessarily give

694
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,840
them the tools in hand to do something

695
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,159
about it. It explains it but it doesn't

696
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,039
necessarily offer them you know the

697
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,880
context of here's what you can do

698
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,320
>> uh you know tomorrow. But the most

699
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,840
important reason I didn't write that

700
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,880
book is it's already been written. It's

701
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,279
called Merchants of Dow uh by Naomi

702
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:02,000
Reskis and uh and uh Eric Conway. And

703
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,720
there's another terrific book by Jane

704
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Mayer called Dark Money. So if people

705
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,159
want to understand the

706
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,279
>> economic forces and the and the other

707
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,480
structural forces behind the information

708
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,679
ecosystem that we live in today, those

709
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,440
books have been written and and I I did

710
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,760
say a little bit more about those in

711
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,559
some of my other work, but you know, I I

712
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,039
hardly recommend those two books as your

713
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,200
introduction. And because here here's

714
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,279
the interesting part too that that I

715
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:39,039
noticed. I mean my work is based on on

716
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:42,880
on this idea from merchants of doubt.

717
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:46,240
The this all started with science denial

718
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,919
and science denial was about money

719
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,600
and then it became about ideology and

720
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,919
political power and then post-truth

721
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,679
comes along and you know they said oh

722
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,679
look we can do to any reality we want

723
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,279
what they already did to science and

724
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,600
then it's not necessarily about money

725
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,559
it's about other things but the but the

726
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,120
structure the reason that it existed

727
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:16,600
that that that blueprint

728
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,600
uh um the pathway was economic.

729
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,240
>> Yeah, those are some great Rex to point

730
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,000
people towards. Um, I guess I'm just

731
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,360
trying to

732
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,480
marry the the spirit of your book in my

733
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,640
mind and in my work of going out there,

734
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,679
getting the word out, speaking to people

735
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,399
respectfully and empathetically, but as

736
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,399
much amplification as possible

737
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,240
>> with.

738
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,799
So, one of the things that I focus on in

739
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:50,320
my work is how varied a lot of

740
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,320
Trump voters are in terms of um

741
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,919
>> where they are, where they voted for uh

742
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,080
why they voted for him, their

743
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,640
backgrounds. And I think sometimes when

744
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,919
we don't think about the very specific

745
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,159
grounded

746
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,080
>> communities and the problems they face,

747
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,240
then

748
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,159
>> when we do want to send messages to them

749
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,720
or even engage with them, it kind of

750
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,640
gets lost in translation. So, I can give

751
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,320
you a quick couple quick examples, but

752
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,600
it sounds like you might know

753
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,080
>> you already get the gist of what I'm

754
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,080
saying.

755
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,640
>> I I know. I mean, I've I love your work

756
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,720
and and I've tried to do similar work as

757
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,240
a philosopher, you know, untrained in

758
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,039
field work, going out to talk to

759
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,919
flat-earthers, you know, to to talk to,

760
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,600
you know, other deniers and see and and

761
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,320
they are varied and they, you know, they

762
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,840
do have different, you know, I ideas

763
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,200
about, you know, why they're doing what

764
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,360
they do. But the the common thread is

765
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,039
mistrust.

766
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,600
The common thread is that

767
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,519
they're getting bad information.

768
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,200
It's not that the the true information

769
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,640
is not accessible to them. It's that

770
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
they don't trust the people who are

771
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,960
sharing it with them. And the thing to

772
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,960
realize here is that one goal of

773
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,840
disinformation is not just to get people

774
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,399
to believe a falsehood. It's to distrust

775
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,000
the person who's telling them the true

776
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,640
information.

777
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,799
>> Absolutely.

778
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,320
>> So that's that's a nice entree if you

779
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,120
think about it. If you're out talking to

780
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,640
someone, if you're out talking to a a

781
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,760
Trump supporter, you're talking to

782
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,480
somebody who thinks that there are

783
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,840
microchips in the vaccines

784
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,799
or you're talking to somebody who

785
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,159
doesn't believe in climate change,

786
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:33,039
they universally think that they've been

787
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,799
lied to. They they mistrust because they

788
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,200
think they've been lied to. And you can

789
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,440
work with that because the truth is they

790
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,799
have been lied to. They just don't

791
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,679
understand who was doing the lying. Oh,

792
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,120
you the example here uh is is uh uh

793
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,440
preient about um microchips in the

794
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,799
vaccines. Everybody's heard of this idea

795
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,360
that there were microchips in the

796
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,039
vaccines. And I think I forget who did

797
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,519
the estimate, but it was a it was a

798
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,080
reliable source that

799
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,919
hundreds of thousands of people died

800
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,919
from not taking the vaccines because

801
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,679
they thought that there were microchips

802
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,520
in the vaccines. Where did that come

803
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,879
from? It came from Russian intelligence

804
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,679
>> and and but they didn't know that. So I

805
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,520
mean they were lied to by a malign actor

806
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,359
and died lost family members in that. So

807
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,879
I mean could you convince somebody that

808
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,200
they could take the vaccine because they

809
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,639
were being lied to? Maybe if you spent

810
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,960
the time to find out what they really

811
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,760
what their interests really were and who

812
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,879
they could really trust.

813
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,800
>> Yeah. I I will say I was very struck by

814
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,280
not just your call for empathy and

815
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,240
respect talking across the aisle or

816
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,480
however you want to put it. Um but the

817
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,240
way that you wrote the whole book um it

818
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,839
made sense to me at the end when you

819
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,679
said

820
00:34:53,839 --> 00:35:00,079
essentially I grew up in a working class

821
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,400
non-ol household. um to me I thought you

822
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,560
know he he gets it on some level like

823
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,000
he's he's in he's been in multiple sort

824
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,440
of social worlds let's say um so I was

825
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,880
curious if you want to talk a little bit

826
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,880
about that I have a very similar

827
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,839
background um and I find that very

828
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,240
informs the way that I approach

829
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,320
my research but also our politics today

830
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,079
and how I try to talk to people about it

831
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,240
so did your background if I'm sessing it

832
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,000
correctly do you think it really

833
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,960
impacted this book and the way that you

834
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,280
wrote it.

835
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,440
>> Yeah, it it did. I grew up poor. I grew

836
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,240
up in a house where my parents believed

837
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,240
in education and we had books. I mean,

838
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:45,040
mostly we had the encyclopedia which I

839
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:48,000
read and enjoyed. Um, but I grew up in a

840
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,160
neighborhood that was,

841
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,160
um, close to the airport, uh, the city

842
00:35:52,160 --> 00:36:00,800
dump, uh, strip clubs, bars. Um, it was

843
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,520
a dangerous neighborhood. Uh, uh, and

844
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,920
and it was, uh, you know, the the

845
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,560
schools were not terrific. And I mean,

846
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,920
we were we were poor. There were three

847
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,000
trailer parks within walking distance.

848
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,400
And the reason we had a house is because

849
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,359
my mom and dad built it. After World War

850
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,200
II, came home. Uh my dad more or less

851
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,640
stole the nails from a job site and

852
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:29,680
built a house. Um these were the nails

853
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:32,240
that fairness to my dad. The nails that

854
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,400
carpenter bends dropped the nail and

855
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,599
just leave it. And he

856
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,920
and we had it just a little bit better.

857
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,440
We had a house. We had an encyclopedia.

858
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,000
They wanted all their kids to go to

859
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,320
college and they did. But I know what

860
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,200
it's like to be talked down to. I know

861
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,200
what it feels like to have people think

862
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,599
that if you're poor, you couldn't

863
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,079
possibly be smart.

864
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,400
Every um respect for, you know, who you

865
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:06,160
can or cannot make a joke about or talk

866
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,760
about doesn't extend to people who grew

867
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,280
up in trailer parks. it doesn't extend

868
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,440
to, you know, people from the

869
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,200
neighborhood that I grew up in. So, I

870
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,839
know what that feels like. So, it felt

871
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,599
to me when I got into this that the

872
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,920
people I was trying to convince were the

873
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,839
people that I grew up with and they're

874
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,640
not stupid.

875
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:31,119
They're not unable to reason. Um, they

876
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,720
need to be respected and they need to be

877
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,720
spoken to um with,

878
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,040
you know, a a a good a good deal of

879
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:45,440
empathy. So yes, it did inform inform my

880
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,880
approach because I feel that

881
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,800
I feel a lot of people got cheated in

882
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,560
science denial and a lot of people are

883
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,760
getting cheated today with reality

884
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,000
denial. I know I met a guy at the flat

885
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,680
earth convention

886
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,800
um who was one of the the guest speakers

887
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,800
and um you know we we talked for a while

888
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,880
and

889
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,119
I found out a few years later that he

890
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,119
died of COVID because he was also a

891
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:19,760
COVID denier. Now he he was a victim. He

892
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,880
it was it was it was too bad.

893
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,480
>> I absolutely agree on all that. um as

894
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
like someone who came from a

895
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,480
working-class background and now you

896
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,200
know um

897
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,480
>> you know you're at MIT.

898
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,720
>> Yeah.

899
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,119
Um I but it's interesting because I I

900
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,240
almost feel like a lot of my work which

901
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,119
does look at very specific pockets of

902
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,960
conservative um rural conservative

903
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,040
religious communities um is partially in

904
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,640
reaction to a lot of the rhetoric that I

905
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,680
have seen in spaces elite institutional

906
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,920
academic spaces that sort of just deride

907
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,480
Trump voters as you know racist

908
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,400
uneducated stupid at large and that

909
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,760
>> yeah it's just not a helpful

910
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,320
thing, especially if we're

911
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,320
>> It is not

912
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,480
>> Oh, here's the book if nobody's seen it

913
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,880
yet. It's very small and portable.

914
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,119
>> Um yeah, keep it in your purse or your

915
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,040
backpack. Um but especially if we're

916
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,960
going to, you know, do something about

917
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,320
it in talking to believers um but also

918
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,240
amplification um and creators. So, I

919
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,359
also wanted to talk given that this is

920
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,040
MIT as you just pointed out a bit about

921
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,960
institutional

922
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,680
knowledge creation. Um so in the book

923
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,079
you do point towards truth in that sort

924
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,839
of direction. So like institutions like

925
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:45,280
the press um academics as trustworthy

926
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,680
places. Um how is that looking these

927
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,880
days? Would you would you like to opine

928
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,520
on that in terms of the sort of attacks

929
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:58,160
we've seen on the press and academia

930
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:01,119
right now and your work? Any thoughts? I

931
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,320
I I find it shocking

932
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:08,480
that the main people who are standing up

933
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:10,240
are comedians and Harvard.

934
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,599
And I got to give a shout out to Wesley

935
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,520
and I went to Wesley and his

936
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,520
undergraduate and uh uh

937
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,000
their uh their president is doing a

938
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,400
terrific job standing up as well. But a

939
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,160
lot of places have capitulated. I you

940
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,160
know you you held up the book and people

941
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,560
can see that tiny little book and the

942
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,520
reason it's so tiny and what it is is

943
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,160
because I love love love

944
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,640
Tim Snyder's book on tyranny. That's the

945
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,040
book that I read and it kind of got me

946
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,680
through Trump's first term and thinking

947
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,160
about I want to do a book like that now

948
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,440
on what I see the problem as. And you

949
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:52,320
open on tyranny and the first chapter

950
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,800
says do not comply in advance.

951
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,079
What are the tech companies doing? What

952
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,880
are the media companies doing? What are

953
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,240
the universities doing? A lot of them

954
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,319
are complying in advance. Uh that is the

955
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,480
one thing that you really cannot do. I

956
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,560
mean, it for one thing that amplifiers

957
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,880
the perceived power of the person who's

958
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,040
oppressing you. It makes them not have

959
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,640
to expend the power to do more to get

960
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,000
you, but it makes other people feel

961
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,920
like, oh, well, it's inevitable. I mean,

962
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,480
if Colombia is going to, you know, roll

963
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,720
over, we might as well roll over, too.

964
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,640
So, I have and comedians,

965
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,800
it's funny, isn't it? I mean, because

966
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,160
comedians

967
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,240
I read a piece about this the other day,

968
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,240
and I don't I don't want to plagiarize.

969
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,119
Uh, comedians have a sharp eye for the

970
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,520
absurd, for the ridiculous, for the the

971
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,520
places where things don't fit. And I

972
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,079
guess it maybe shouldn't surprise us

973
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,319
that comedians are the ones who who are

974
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,880
being attacked and who are resisting and

975
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,960
see things uh, you know, as they are. I

976
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,920
mean, the really shocking thing is the

977
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,760
people who they really could take a risk

978
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,400
and don't.

979
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,400
And so it always makes me admire more

980
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,359
the people who really have something to

981
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,240
lose and they take a risk anyway.

982
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:17,040
Um so I mean that's can I opine on it?

983
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,200
That's that's my opinion. There are just

984
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,480
shockingly few people who you would

985
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,240
think would see where we are. I mean we

986
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,079
are not on the road to fascism.

987
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,800
We are

988
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,359
arguably there

989
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,119
early when when post-truth came out. Uh,

990
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,040
I'm sorry. When on disinformation came

991
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,560
out and I went on the road and I did

992
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,480
talks and that, you know, kind of when

993
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,560
the mic and the camera were off, people

994
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,920
would ask me and now I wish they'd been

995
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,760
on so I could get credit for the

996
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,240
prediction, but you know, they would ask

997
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,800
me how how is this going to come out?

998
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,839
And I said

999
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,359
military uh in the streets policing

1000
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,599
American citizens, mass deportation,

1001
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:05,160
uh ultimately concentration camps,

1002
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,160
political prisoners,

1003
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:13,119
Where are we not there so far? Uh I mean

1004
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,560
concentration camps maybe not that yet,

1005
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,839
but but arguably so in ICE detention

1006
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,599
centers and

1007
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,760
>> and who knows where I mean we're we're

1008
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,640
not even a year into this yet. So I mean

1009
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,720
we are I've got friends overseas who

1010
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,040
will not come to the United States.

1011
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,119
They're they're so you know people from

1012
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,680
Europe who they they've seen this

1013
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,200
before. you know there there's this is

1014
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,760
how you boil the frog right I mean

1015
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,480
they've seen this before and it is very

1016
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,640
scary time and you know if you ask me as

1017
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,240
a human being living here in you know

1018
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:49,440
the hell hole that is Portland Oregon um

1019
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,800
do I worry about somebody knocking on my

1020
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,079
door in the middle of the night? Yeah I

1021
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,440
I really don't at this point

1022
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,280
>> could it happen? Yes it could. And the

1023
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,520
thing is

1024
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,119
if you look at countries like um

1025
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,599
we're not going to become Russia or

1026
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,359
China overnight. The worry is Turkey.

1027
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,200
The worry is Hungary where you look at

1028
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,800
what happened in those countries.

1029
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,760
They're professed to be

1030
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,520
um democracies.

1031
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,720
But what they did a few years ago in

1032
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,920
Turkey is that they said that um

1033
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,400
propaganda misinformation was punishable

1034
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,839
by a prison sentence.

1035
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,760
But who was spreading the

1036
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,920
misinformation?

1037
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,440
It was the people who were fighting it

1038
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,960
>> and then they were declared terrorists

1039
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,880
and a lot of them were in prison. So

1040
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,280
they have a number of journalists in

1041
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,280
prison in Turkey. I can't go to Turkey

1042
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,280
based on you know things that I've said

1043
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,240
though one of my earlier book was

1044
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,480
translated into into Turkish but um you

1045
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,800
you know you wonder well why are these

1046
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,160
journalists in prison and someone from

1047
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,960
Turkey said oh well they're all

1048
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,760
terrorists uhhuh that could happen in

1049
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,319
the United States why are all these I

1050
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,440
mean Antifa has already been declared by

1051
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,960
Trump a terrorist organization

1052
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,880
I don't know if he's done the same for

1053
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,359
Black Lives Matter matter. I I know

1054
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,000
people in those

1055
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,599
movements. They are not domestic

1056
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,720
terrorists, but could they be targeted

1057
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,520
and hauled away in the middle of the

1058
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,520
night? Yes.

1059
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,960
>> Yeah. Oh, boy.

1060
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,760
>> I mean, it's interesting that your book

1061
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,800
also has, I would say, a sort of

1062
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,520
optimistic flavor to it. Um there is

1063
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,359
still things we can do fight back. Lots

1064
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,880
of different lists about practical

1065
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,040
guidance like when you interviewed

1066
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,400
various counter or um counter

1067
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,680
intelligence officials um

1068
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,960
>> counter intelligence and army

1069
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,160
intelligence.

1070
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,040
>> Yeah. Do you still feel that way or some

1071
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,520
of this is coming from my

1072
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,720
>> Yeah.

1073
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,480
>> You know my um experience too where

1074
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,839
people are just tired and scared and

1075
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,400
much more than they might have been in

1076
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,079
2023. So Before we transfer to

1077
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,319
questions, I'll throw that last one at

1078
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,760
you.

1079
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,000
>> And and they're not watching the news

1080
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,560
either because they can't stand it.

1081
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,319
>> Exactly.

1082
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,800
>> Somebody told me resistance is a form of

1083
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,240
self-care. And and I get that. You know,

1084
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,079
I if I say I'm optimistic, then it tends

1085
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,359
to undermine the seriousness of the

1086
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,200
problem.

1087
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,160
>> Yeah. I want to say I've graduated from

1088
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,960
optimism to hope

1089
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,960
because hope

1090
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,960
optimism kind of has this feeling that

1091
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,160
things are going to get better. You

1092
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,200
know, I believe in the future.

1093
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,800
But I forget who it was who said it.

1094
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,079
It's written down here and I I can't

1095
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,560
reach it without getting off camera. But

1096
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,119
hope is a discipline. Hope is a

1097
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,400
practice. I mean you you if you have

1098
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,960
hope, you have to work at having hope.

1099
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,359
You have to do something

1100
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,520
to make hope

1101
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,920
fulfill itself.

1102
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,440
So I wouldn't say that I'm optimistic

1103
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,920
because the predictions just keep being

1104
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,920
worse and worse and worse. Uh you know

1105
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,359
the fulfillment. But am I hopeful? Yes.

1106
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,400
Primarily because I don't want to give

1107
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,000
up on my country.

1108
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,960
And I don't want to give up on the

1109
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,640
people that I know who are being

1110
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,040
victimized by this. Some of whom are

1111
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,440
people who voted for Trump,

1112
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,119
>> but

1113
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,359
and it's just on the tip of my tongue

1114
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,720
who said hope is a discipline or hope is

1115
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,119
a practice. I'm going to get that wrong

1116
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,440
and it's going to bug me. Hang on.

1117
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,240
>> Yeah, go for it.

1118
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,560
>> Hang hang on a second. It's the academic

1119
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,000
in me that it's gonna that's gonna bug

1120
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:59,280
me until I until I get this.

1121
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,079
>> Yeah, I know. This citations are are the

1122
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,160
thing.

1123
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:07,640
>> Hope is a discipline. Uh Miriam Eaba

1124
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,640
Miriam Cabba.

1125
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,599
>> Look it up.

1126
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,319
>> All right, [laughter]

1127
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,440
that's a good place for us to segue to

1128
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:19,760
questions from the audience. Um,

1129
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,760
actually the first one is kind of very

1130
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,240
closely connected to what we were just

1131
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,920
talking about. Jane asks, "What do we

1132
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,920
do? I am infuriated, terrified, engaged,

1133
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,960
doing what I can see to do, but none of

1134
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,640
it feels enough."

1135
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,280
>> Um,

1136
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,480
we need everybody to grab an or to do

1137
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,839
what they can. Nobody can do everything.

1138
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,599
That doesn't mean that you can do

1139
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:48,800
nothing. If if we all I mean how many

1140
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:52,800
navalis do you need to bring down a

1141
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:56,480
Putin? Maybe not that many which is why

1142
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,280
you know Putin identified him. I mean we

1143
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,440
we need like I said tell the truth

1144
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,000
loudly from the largest platform that

1145
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,760
you can. If if there were more people

1146
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,680
who understood that, if there were more

1147
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,640
the one thing I wanted my book to do was

1148
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:14,640
to empower people because now now this

1149
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,160
is actually a nice uh uh uh book end to

1150
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,359
what I said earlier.

1151
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,319
>> Disinformation has three goals.

1152
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:26,319
One is to get you to believe something

1153
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:29,040
false. Two is to mistrust and even to

1154
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:32,640
hate the truth tellers. But third is to

1155
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,760
feel hopeless and powerless.

1156
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,520
and cynical. I don't want you to feel

1157
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,119
hopeless and powerless and cynical.

1158
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,920
That's why the end of the book has 10

1159
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,000
steps of things that you can do. Some of

1160
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,440
which are now dated just, you know,

1161
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,160
within a couple of years. But I mean,

1162
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,240
damn right you Yes, there there are

1163
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,800
things that you can do. So, even when

1164
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,119
you feel like there's nothing that you

1165
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,119
can do,

1166
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,280
there are things that you can do. Even

1167
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:05,040
if what you're doing is supporting other

1168
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,280
people in not feeling hopeless, that's

1169
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,000
very important. You know, this is like

1170
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,160
the 12 Angry Men and the the movie,

1171
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,760
right? If one person, which is, you

1172
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,200
know, based on earlier social psych

1173
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,640
work. If one person stands up, sometimes

1174
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,800
that's enough for other people to

1175
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:25,599
follow. If two people stand up, then

1176
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:28,000
sometimes you get a whole herd. So,

1177
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,800
you know, use the words they don't want

1178
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,079
you to use, the words that are now

1179
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,520
banned on federal websites. Be loud, be

1180
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,440
annoying, go to the protests.

1181
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,200
Um, I don't you don't have to get

1182
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:45,839
arrested or teargassed, but you have to

1183
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,559
show up.

1184
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,559
>> Yeah. I actually opened the book to that

1185
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,119
last chapter where Lee gave gives those

1186
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,839
10 things because I think yeah there are

1187
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,280
some things there particular number nine

1188
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,119
take solace in the fact that there are

1189
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,720
many out there who are also engaged in

1190
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,680
this battle like Lee

1191
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,040
>> um that for me at least gives me solace

1192
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,640
um

1193
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,480
>> yeah looking at all the people who are

1194
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,119
doing good work um

1195
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,760
>> thank you

1196
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:15,040
>> so

1197
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,280
this is an interesting one why the

1198
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,599
puzzlement about platforms having given

1199
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,119
up on content moderation, given Elon

1200
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,839
Musk and other platform [laughter]

1201
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,680
owners alliance with subsidies slashed

1202
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,319
with subsidies by the Russians who pedal

1203
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,400
the most dis disinformation including

1204
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,800
vaccine disinformation.

1205
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,520
>> Yeah.

1206
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,079
>> Or if you're asking if we're puzzled

1207
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,119
>> the minute I said

1208
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,280
I was give up.

1209
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,160
Why am I puzzled by why Elon must give

1210
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:47,839
up on it? Yeah. Okay, I'm not. But but

1211
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,760
here's here's the thing that the Center

1212
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,680
for Countering Digital Hate found in

1213
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,520
2019

1214
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,480
that

1215
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,760
some shocking amount, I think it was 65%

1216
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,079
or more of the

1217
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,599
false information about vaccines on

1218
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,880
Twitter was due to 12 people.

1219
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:12,640
So, and that was pre Elon Musk.

1220
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:16,480
Now, the night before Elon Musk took

1221
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:19,359
over at Twitter, I checked all 12 of

1222
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:22,000
those cuz I know who they are.

1223
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:25,040
Eight of them were on Twitter. So, it

1224
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,119
means that even before Elon Musk,

1225
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,640
Twitter wasn't doing a good enough job.

1226
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,440
I mean, what could they have done? They

1227
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,920
they could have deplatformed the liars.

1228
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,720
You know who one of those liars was? RFK

1229
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,040
Jr.

1230
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,960
uh they they abdicated their

1231
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,280
responsibility and I mean what happened

1232
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,240
with Mark Zuckerberg he you know

1233
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,720
crumbled all of a sudden uh he used to

1234
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,559
believe in this he understands the

1235
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,800
problem he once pretended that he didn't

1236
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:58,240
but he he does and then and then he

1237
00:52:52,800 --> 00:53:00,640
gives up on it so I mean yeah um

1238
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:03,359
I I shouldn't be puzzled

1239
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,640
I I I shouldn't be

1240
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,839
it's just Um, how do you how do you

1241
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,240
explain that level of cowardice

1242
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:15,760
by billionaires?

1243
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,800
I just I don't understand it.

1244
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,200
>> I will say from my end um so I've been

1245
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,920
involved in some projects looking at

1246
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,559
specifically third party factchecking

1247
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,200
and how it was almost single-handedly

1248
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,119
funded the industry itself post 2016 by

1249
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,839
Facebook. Um, in my opinion, it is

1250
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:37,359
largely a PR effort, but then the, you

1251
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:40,559
know, the plug was pulled 2024, 2025

1252
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,119
after Trump was elected. Um, the writing

1253
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,480
was on the wall for a while with that

1254
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,359
with the fact checkers that we

1255
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,520
interviewed. Um, like it it wasn't a

1256
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,359
surprise for the people inside. It

1257
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,280
wasn't like the complete about face that

1258
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:58,319
we've it looked like from outside. Um,

1259
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,720
so I Yeah, it's

1260
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,760
>> Yeah,

1261
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,760
>> I I get that. I mean, the fact checker

1262
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,000
Glenn uh Kesler, the Washington Post,

1263
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,920
the guy with the Pukios,

1264
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,640
>> he he just left the Washington Post.

1265
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,040
They have no plans to replace him.

1266
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,599
>> Um,

1267
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,520
>> yeah.

1268
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,440
>> Yeah. No, no, you're you're right. The

1269
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,839
these things were coming. It wasn't

1270
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,200
overnight. It was it was coming for a

1271
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,559
long time.

1272
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:28,079
>> Yeah. Um, so here's another one which is

1273
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:30,400
still focused on social media and I

1274
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,400
think uh, yeah, you talk about this in

1275
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,160
your book, but we can update it a bit.

1276
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,000
So given the role that social media

1277
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,680
plays in spreading disinformation, do

1278
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,319
you believe tech companies should be

1279
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,680
regulated more strictly? And if so, what

1280
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,599
kind of regulation do you think would

1281
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,920
actually work without endangering free

1282
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,599
speech? And I'm going to tack on are

1283
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,319
there things other than the fairness

1284
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,720
doctrine and section 230 which you talk

1285
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:55,119
about in your book that you think could

1286
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,760
be levers now?

1287
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,079
>> Yeah. Uh well I mean one thing we could

1288
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,480
do is point out the hypocrisy of all the

1289
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,960
folks crying about free speech in

1290
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,440
Congress and censorship and then turning

1291
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,040
around and you know embracing censorship

1292
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,319
in another name. But that's probably not

1293
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,359
going to work. But the the best idea I

1294
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:17,520
ever heard was by Steven Luwendowski

1295
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,559
who's a professor at University of

1296
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,240
Bristol over in England. And he said

1297
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,400
that the real problem was the

1298
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,160
algorithms. That the algorithms were a

1299
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,319
black box.

1300
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:35,040
And that what we need is

1301
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:39,119
not to regulate the companies

1302
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:41,119
in terms of the content that they

1303
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,040
put up, take down, you know, the human

1304
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,280
action. What we need is more

1305
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,240
transparency, which doesn't sound like

1306
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:51,040
censorship to me at all. We need more

1307
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,880
transparency in the algorithms. Could

1308
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:57,680
you make the algorithms that run YouTube

1309
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:01,280
and all these other companies

1310
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,440
uh such that they had to be have a board

1311
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,119
of overseers?

1312
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:10,799
experts, academic experts say uh have

1313
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:13,520
all of the private user data blinded so

1314
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:16,640
that you know you you couldn't um so

1315
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,839
that privacy wasn't an issue because it

1316
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,559
always seems to me that the crisis comes

1317
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,240
it's too late a whistleblower or after

1318
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,319
the harm's done then they go back and

1319
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,960
they go oh my god yes it was the

1320
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,880
algorithm so why aren't more eyes on the

1321
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,160
algorithms the algorithms are black

1322
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,400
boxes their inner workings are known

1323
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,960
pretty much only to a few people at each

1324
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,920
of the big tech companies. That's where

1325
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,520
the problem lies. Uh I'm convinced

1326
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:48,079
Stephen uh uh convinced me of this. So

1327
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,160
could the US Congress

1328
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:54,480
um do something about that? I think

1329
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,319
that's not exactly lowhanging fruit, but

1330
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,480
I think that's something that you could

1331
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,640
have a persuadable sort of an argument

1332
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,160
about. Well, but don't you believe in

1333
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,559
transparency?

1334
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,200
But you're against censorship, right?

1335
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,440
So, let's not censor the speech, but

1336
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,119
let's have more eyes on the algorithms

1337
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,880
of these private companies that are

1338
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:17,280
doing public harm. Um, I I think that is

1339
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:22,079
a winnable argument and and I credit

1340
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:24,240
Steve Luwendowski for for sharing that.

1341
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,559
>> When you say transparency,

1342
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,720
do you I think in your book you say

1343
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,720
something about credible academics being

1344
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,400
able to look at the inner workings.

1345
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,200
>> Yes. But I'm curious what that looks

1346
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,119
like for you. Um, when you say

1347
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,000
transparency

1348
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,000
from a practical standpoint,

1349
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,520
every I I could I could name

1350
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:56,559
so many people who are disinformation

1351
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:59,920
fighters who are now out of work because

1352
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:03,200
their universities abandoned them,

1353
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,960
who are, and I'm not going to name them,

1354
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,480
because anybody could do a Google search

1355
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,480
and find out who they are and I I don't

1356
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,640
want them to be you know cause them any

1357
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:14,880
more trouble but

1358
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:19,680
who are experts all all women by the way

1359
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,359
who are experts on tech who are experts

1360
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,359
on

1361
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,359
um

1362
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:31,200
how

1363
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:33,520
reach from uh tech platforms that are

1364
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,760
not careful about privileging say

1365
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,280
engagement over truth. So I mean

1366
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:42,079
practically what could we do? There are

1367
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,240
I don't want to say unemployed

1368
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,119
but

1369
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:50,319
uh undermployed

1370
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:53,839
recently uh uh criticized and maligned

1371
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:55,839
disinformation fighters who I can think

1372
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,079
of who would be terrific.

1373
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:00,799
>> And then people maybe say oh but but you

1374
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,720
know the but what about their politics?

1375
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,079
Well, gee, that's why you have more than

1376
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,599
one of them. That's why you have a

1377
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,200
board. That's why it's actually

1378
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,839
transparent.

1379
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,240
Um, I I I don't know. I just I like the

1380
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:16,160
idea of that because it immediately

1381
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:18,160
defangs the claim that this is some

1382
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,319
censorship.

1383
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,640
It's not censorship, it's transparency.

1384
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:25,440
If Elon Musk's beliefs so much in

1385
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,960
transparency, why are his algorithms

1386
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,520
opaque?

1387
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,440
I don't understand it.

1388
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,280
Yeah, I'm not disagreeing. I'm just as

1389
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,359
someone who's in an academic environment

1390
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,480
and who's

1391
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,079
>> wanted transparency as well. I also see

1392
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,079
that it's not a panacea. There's a lot

1393
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,599
of systemic stuff like yeah

1394
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,920
disinformation research was being

1395
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,400
flagged and defunded right now. Um

1396
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,000
>> yeah,

1397
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,520
>> but also like academic capacity. Um but

1398
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,440
that's a whole another rabbit hole and I

1399
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,960
won't go down it right now because we

1400
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,760
have more questions. Um

1401
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,680
>> let's see. Oh, Katie, I'm a NASA

1402
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,000
astronaut who lived on the space

1403
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,480
station. How would you respond to these

1404
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,960
two different types of flatearthers?

1405
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,440
Number one, ones who are hoping they are

1406
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,520
wrong but want proof. And number two,

1407
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:19,760
ones who don't want to be convinced.

1408
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:22,640
>> Oh, that's that's interesting. Um,

1409
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,160
flatearthers. I wrote about this in the

1410
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,000
opening chapter of my book, How to Talk

1411
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,240
to a Science Tonight, where I talk about

1412
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,240
my experience at the Flat Earth

1413
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:35,599
International Conference in uh um in

1414
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:38,319
Denver in 2018.

1415
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:42,720
They are convinced, they're conspiracy

1416
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:44,480
theorists to the last person.

1417
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,079
And the reason they believe in flat

1418
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,400
earth is because they think that there

1419
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:52,559
is a cabal of people in power who have

1420
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,200
lied to them. Um so drawing a

1421
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:58,720
distinction between the people who are

1422
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,559
hoping that they're wrong

1423
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,440
makes it sound like they're open to

1424
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:05,119
evidence. But to be open to evidence,

1425
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:09,680
they would first have to be open to

1426
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:13,520
trust. The trust is the barrier. I think

1427
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,960
um I said I think in print and certainly

1428
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,480
out on the road when I was talking about

1429
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:21,680
it that to me the problem of science

1430
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,240
denial in general is not an evidence

1431
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,920
problem or a fact problem. It's a trust

1432
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,319
problem.

1433
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,000
So that distinction while a sharp

1434
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,720
distinction between the ones who are

1435
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,400
hoping that they're wrong

1436
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:40,240
I mean and the ones who aren't.

1437
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:43,599
Here's one thing that I noticed.

1438
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,040
If you're a scientist, which I hope that

1439
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,599
somebody who lives on the space station

1440
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:52,160
is, you understand that a scientist is

1441
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,880
relentlessly looking for evidence to

1442
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,400
show that they might be wrong. Whether

1443
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,920
it's they're hoping or not, they're

1444
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,880
they're looking for they're open to that

1445
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,520
evidence. They care about uh evidence.

1446
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,119
And here's the crucial point. If there

1447
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,839
is evidence to show that they're wrong,

1448
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:11,200
they change their mind. It's that last

1449
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:13,119
part that the flatearthers are missing.

1450
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,880
They will not change their mind when

1451
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,119
presented with evidence that shows that

1452
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:22,960
they're wrong.

1453
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:25,119
So that first group is very very small.

1454
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,680
The group of people who are hoping that

1455
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,920
they're wrong. I just I didn't I didn't

1456
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,880
meet a lot of them. Maybe they're not

1457
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,280
the ones who go to the FEIC convention,

1458
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,599
but I didn't meet a lot of them. They

1459
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,200
were convinced that they knew the truth.

1460
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,559
And they knew the truth because they

1461
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:47,359
were the ones who had been awakened to

1462
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:49,760
the astronauts. Yes. Professors,

1463
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,599
pilots, government officials who had

1464
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:55,839
been lying to them because they were

1465
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:58,319
presumably getting something out of it.

1466
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:01,119
It's a fascinating subculture and that's

1467
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:03,839
why I went to this convention because I

1468
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:06,400
thought if I can go there and talk to

1469
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,880
them and get them to listen to me and I

1470
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,559
listen to them then I can talk to

1471
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,640
climate deniers then I can talk to

1472
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,680
vaccine deniers.

1473
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,359
Well then COVID hit and so some of the

1474
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,760
research for the book was curtailed by

1475
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,319
the time I got to some of those uh

1476
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,640
latter topics. But it was uh it was

1477
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:26,480
really fascinating.

1478
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,599
>> Yeah. Shout out to On the Ground

1479
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,920
Research.

1480
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,359
>> Yes.

1481
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:34,880
>> Um always pushing it. Okay. So, as a

1482
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:38,240
good followup, um talking about who we

1483
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:40,240
can talk to and convince. Uh as a

1484
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,559
college instructor, I understand and

1485
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,960
agree with Lee's arguments. My question

1486
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,880
is, how can we engage college students

1487
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,200
to read and persuade them about the role

1488
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,440
of disinformation when they don't like

1489
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,000
to read for school purposes?

1490
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,079
>> God, I wish there were a book. Uh, you

1491
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
know, a really short book that you could

1492
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,079
read in an hour.

1493
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,039
>> Um, yeah, you could, you know, I tried

1494
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,559
to get MIT Press. MIT Press is

1495
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,200
wonderful. Their publicity, their

1496
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,960
marketing, just terrific team. I I came

1497
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,119
up with a wacky idea that what they

1498
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,039
should do is uh you know, print up a few

1499
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,400
extra hundred and just leave them on the

1500
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:19,039
bus, you know, leave them on the subway.

1501
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,839
Kind of a gorilla marketing campaign.

1502
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,599
And their their money was better spent

1503
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:27,440
uh doing other things, I'm sure. But,

1504
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:31,839
you know, that's um I don't know. How do

1505
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:34,240
you convince people to read?

1506
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:35,679
I wish I could get the book banned. If

1507
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,799
you could get it banned, then people

1508
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:38,720
[clears throat] would read it, wouldn't

1509
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,319
they? There's a I live in Portland,

1510
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,480
Oregon, and there's a the my favorite

1511
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,920
bookstore here is Pal's bookstore, and

1512
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,599
they have on their reader board right

1513
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,440
now, I just drove by it the other day.

1514
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,520
It said, "Banning a book only makes

1515
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,680
people want to read it."

1516
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,799
>> I mean,

1517
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,559
I think I also

1518
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,760
>> I don't know. I don't know what to do to

1519
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,920
get people to read a short, cute, timely

1520
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,079
book. I don't know.

1521
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:06,160
>> Yeah. I mean, I personally, as someone

1522
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:07,839
who also teaches college students, um I

1523
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,160
yeah, I think I get where this person's

1524
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,480
coming from because it's it's not just

1525
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,720
like about disinformation. It's just

1526
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,160
hard to get them to read, period. But I

1527
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,240
think there are ways to get them to care

1528
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,000
about disinformation as younger people,

1529
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,760
even though it's

1530
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,960
>> a world that they've grown up with more

1531
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,079
so than

1532
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,280
>> some of us.

1533
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,960
>> I haven't taught in 10 years. Uh I I

1534
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,960
recognize this is a growing problem.

1535
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,520
Look, that's one reason that I made the

1536
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,680
book so short and accessible because

1537
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,599
people don't like to read. Even readers

1538
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,119
sometimes don't like to read. So, I

1539
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,280
wanted to have it be a book that they

1540
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,880
picked up, started the first page, and

1541
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,839
then couldn't put it down because they

1542
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,160
could read it literally within an hour.

1543
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:50,720
I I don't know what to do. if you can

1544
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:53,200
think of an idea because I've still uh

1545
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:56,640
you know the book's still in print and I

1546
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:59,839
I know the folks at MIT Press publicity

1547
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,920
would you know love to hear uh uh other

1548
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:03,599
ideas. I I if you have any idea for how

1549
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,680
to get people to read it or other

1550
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,599
marketing campaigns I I tried to get

1551
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,680
them to to print it out in different

1552
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,720
colors, red, purple, blue, yellow,

1553
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,280
orange and sell it as a six-pack so that

1554
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,520
you kept one and you gave five away, you

1555
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,079
know.

1556
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:21,359
>> Oh, that's nice. uh I you know I I had

1557
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,760
all these ideas uh you know or or take a

1558
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:26,079
page from the book and blow it up

1559
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,400
>> but but take out the identifying

1560
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,240
information just put it up in the tea

1561
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,400
tunnel so that people would read that

1562
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,920
book and go and then take a picture of

1563
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,520
it go I've got to read this book and

1564
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,039
then they'd go get it. I I I like

1565
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:42,240
gorilla marketing. Um well we'll see

1566
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,920
maybe for the next one.

1567
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,799
>> Okay we're going to get to the AI

1568
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:49,280
questions now. Um, I had a few lined up

1569
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:50,319
too since this is MIT. Um,

1570
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,640
>> yep.

1571
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:54,480
>> Uh, let's see.

1572
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,640
>> You mentioned AI will lead to more

1573
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,359
disinformation than ever before. How

1574
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,799
should this be addressed?

1575
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:02,960
I think you should I'm also going to

1576
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,960
tack on to the this person's question.

1577
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,880
Um, how will it lead to more

1578
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,480
disinformation? Because I think that

1579
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,480
will connect with how you answer. that

1580
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:17,680
the problem of disinformation used to be

1581
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,520
there used to be a barrier to

1582
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,160
disinformation. If you look back at the

1583
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,400
disinformation that existed in the 2016

1584
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,440
presidential campaign that was coming

1585
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,760
out of Russia, it was bad. I mean, it

1586
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,599
was persuasive enough that, you know, if

1587
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,160
you just get a certain percentage, but

1588
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,480
it was it was not good disinformation.

1589
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,720
They were memes that had misspellings

1590
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:44,640
and you know diction problems and I mean

1591
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:48,480
it was just the quality was not good. Um

1592
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:50,799
but now it's so much easier. I mean it's

1593
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,920
like asking the question of how did the

1594
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:55,680
Canon personal printer uh impact

1595
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,160
counterfeiting?

1596
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:00,880
Very much so. Because you no longer

1597
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:03,839
needed an engraver to you know fake

1598
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:06,319
those bills. You could do it on on a a

1599
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:08,000
personal copier. Better be careful. I

1600
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,240
used to work for the Fed which detected

1601
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,720
counterfeiting. But I mean I I think the

1602
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,559
technologies probably moved on that that

1603
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:18,319
printer that Canon and I can't remember

1604
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:21,120
what it was made counterfeiting so poss

1605
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,560
much more possible. Um so you know

1606
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:27,679
putting the tools to make it easy just

1607
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:31,199
you know makes it easier.

1608
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:34,159
you I I've often joked that

1609
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:36,080
you look in it's not a joke in Russia

1610
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:39,839
they have troll farms they have people

1611
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:44,880
pumping out this information

1612
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:46,719
um and the primary uh uh

1613
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,400
screening tool is how well do you speak

1614
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,520
English

1615
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,359
they don't have to worry about that

1616
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,279
anymore

1617
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,920
they've got chat GPT they don't need a

1618
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:58,480
troll form they need a troll garden they

1619
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,040
need one person who's a very good

1620
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,839
speaker of English and they can produce

1621
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,520
you know the the the number uh you know

1622
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:08,719
the volume and the quality of

1623
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,199
disinformation are going to increase.

1624
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:16,040
Now the hard part what can you do about

1625
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:16,040
that? Here's the problem.

1626
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,000
I've always been worried since the

1627
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,520
beginning of this debate going back to,

1628
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,759
you know, 2016 before

1629
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:30,000
about things like deep fakes that the

1630
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,759
real danger is not going to be that it's

1631
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,239
going to get you to think that a false

1632
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,679
thing is true. It's going to be that it

1633
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:37,679
gets you to think that a true thing is

1634
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:42,159
false.

1635
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:44,799
When f when fake videos are so prevalent

1636
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:47,279
that you say, "I don't believe any

1637
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:50,239
videos anymore."

1638
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:52,480
That's the real trouble. I I read a an

1639
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:54,159
article in a law journal. Don't ask me

1640
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,600
why I was reading a law journal, but I I

1641
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:58,480
read an article in a law journal

1642
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:03,440
recently where there was a a an attorney

1643
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:05,760
who was bemoning the day when um you

1644
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:09,199
would no longer be able to use audio and

1645
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,960
video evidence in court because fakes

1646
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:13,360
were going to be so prevalent that they

1647
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,080
would no longer be seen by juries as

1648
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,640
reliable sources.

1649
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,360
I think the only possible way to fight

1650
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,840
back against that is education, you

1651
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,760
know, to let people to to try to help

1652
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,440
people understand

1653
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:33,120
how to differentiate between uh fake and

1654
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:35,120
real, not to get cynical, to to instead

1655
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:38,000
bore in. In Finland, they have a

1656
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:40,960
curriculum starting in kindergarten,

1657
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
first grade for how to tell fake news.

1658
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:47,239
We could do that here.

1659
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,239
We can't.

1660
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,920
We got to do that for the adults, too.

1661
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,199
But we better get more literate about

1662
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,040
what's fake and what's not because I

1663
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:59,920
mean, again, we're not on the road to

1664
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:01,920
this. We're here. Uh they just announced

1665
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,239
the other last week was a bad week. I

1666
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,440
mean, they just announced the first AI

1667
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:10,320
actress. Her name is Tilly. She'll say

1668
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,000
and do anything you want. And she's uh

1669
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,840
looking for Hollywood representation.

1670
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,239
agents are clamoring to represent her.

1671
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:20,000
Maybe put the screen actors out of

1672
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:22,159
business. Um, Sora was just announced

1673
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,880
uh, so far only available through

1674
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:27,679
invitation. But can you create a video

1675
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:30,480
in which they had you and me jumping out

1676
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,560
of an airplane with parachutes that were

1677
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,280
pizzas? Yeah, they could because they've

1678
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,640
already done this. when we've all seen

1679
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,920
as educators what chat GPT and I haven't

1680
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,560
taught in 10 years but we've all seen

1681
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:46,560
what chat GPT has done to the student

1682
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:48,719
essay I mean it is it is it is shocking

1683
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,239
so I think the only thing that we can do

1684
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:56,719
is try to become more aware and try to

1685
01:11:52,239 --> 01:12:00,800
keep the tech uh uh you know for

1686
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:03,280
finding it up to date but even as I say

1687
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,520
that I recognize the problem because

1688
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,920
there is no technological solution to

1689
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,600
human malevolence. You You can't We're

1690
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,239
not going to out tech our way. I'm

1691
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,880
sorry. I know it's MIT. You cannot out

1692
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:18,560
tech your way of the disinformation

1693
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:21,520
problem and AI making it easier. Yeah,

1694
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,880
we need a lot of tech help, but we, you

1695
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,920
know, they've got a philosophy

1696
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:28,000
department and a really good one,

1697
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,480
philosophy and and linguistics as I

1698
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,239
believe at MIT. And they need them, too.

1699
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,480
And they need the sociologists and the

1700
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:36,560
science writers and the other people on

1701
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,560
this problem too. It's not just a tech

1702
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,560
problem.

1703
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,920
>> Yeah. So much of that was throwing me

1704
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:48,239
back to a lot of the work that I've done

1705
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:50,080
in previous groups around deep fakes and

1706
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,920
factchecking and how much fear there was

1707
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,400
in the last few election cycles around

1708
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,480
it. Um, but I will say on the education

1709
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,640
front, at times it's easy to say

1710
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,239
literacy and just leave it at that or

1711
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,000
education and just leave it at that. So,

1712
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,600
I'm really glad you pointed out

1713
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,400
>> Finland. Um,

1714
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,159
>> Finland,

1715
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:09,440
>> I think that it's a similar pedagogical

1716
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,440
thing, but I worked a lot with some

1717
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,239
Norwegians who've been pushing

1718
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:16,400
>> this concept of source criticism. So,

1719
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,080
really looking at where these things

1720
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,000
come from, not just like the content

1721
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,600
itself. That's one way to sort of get

1722
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,199
around,

1723
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,960
>> you know, the initial like, is this fake

1724
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,840
or not? Are there multiple hands or

1725
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,760
arms? Is the is the language wrong? Um,

1726
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,280
and we'll have to adjust as we go.

1727
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,040
>> And you shouldn't be lost on anybody

1728
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,040
that if you look at a map, Finland

1729
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,520
shares a border with Russia. I mean,

1730
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,040
they're they're they're used to this.

1731
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,719
There are other things that adults can

1732
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,360
turn to. A friend of mine, Andy Norman,

1733
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,440
wrote a book called Mental Immunity.

1734
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,280
Um, another friend, uh, Sandra

1735
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,440
Vanderlin, wrote a book called

1736
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:54,640
Foolproof. I mean there are tools

1737
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:57,360
available to uh adults who care to learn

1738
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,880
how to think better about these sorts of

1739
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,960
things.

1740
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,880
>> Yeah. And it's often very context

1741
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:07,040
dependent. Unfortunately, there is no

1742
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:09,520
like panacea. So anyway, okay. We have a

1743
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:12,880
lot of questions and we have 15 minutes

1744
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,880
I think. So I will try to get us through

1745
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,440
a few more.

1746
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,280
Um,

1747
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,280
right now there is a lot of focus on the

1748
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,040
dialectics of free speech and what the

1749
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,719
limits may be. How do we think that

1750
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,960
social media companies can moderate

1751
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:31,840
disinformation but do it in a way that

1752
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:33,679
is not considered censoring free speech.

1753
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,400
>> Just wrote an article on this with

1754
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:40,560
Sander Vanderlin in Time magazine. We

1755
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:44,080
did an op-ed called How to Fight

1756
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:48,320
Disinformation Without Censorship.

1757
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:51,199
There are several ways to do it and I

1758
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,480
don't I we you said we've got a lot of

1759
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,880
questions so I don't want to just repeat

1760
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,040
the article here but I will say that if

1761
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:00,040
you think that there aren't ways there

1762
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,040
are

1763
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,360
>> um

1764
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,880
>> was that a copout answer? I'm sorry. I

1765
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,520
>> I don't think so. if you point them to

1766
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:12,320
the Times article. Um,

1767
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:15,040
>> yeah, but I will say you also

1768
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,560
>> you also talk about free speech, as I

1769
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,840
would say, almost a smokeokc screen in

1770
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,520
this book, which I think is a really

1771
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,480
important point.

1772
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,320
>> Um, to keep in mind when whenever the

1773
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,719
censoring or free speech stuff comes up,

1774
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,040
it can be really weaponized. Um

1775
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,800
>> well well yes because it's the easiest

1776
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,360
thing I mean it's the easiest thing in

1777
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,920
the world to claim that the people who

1778
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:38,800
are fighting myths and disinformation

1779
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:42,400
are trying to censor

1780
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:45,120
>> exactly executive order 14 whatever.

1781
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,199
>> Yeah. And and the thing is

1782
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,920
that it's important to realize that that

1783
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:51,679
claim is itself part of the strategic

1784
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,480
campaign

1785
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,199
by disinformers. This was true of Jim

1786
01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:00,719
Jordan way before you know Trump got

1787
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:03,440
reelected. It was I mean this was a a

1788
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:06,080
strategy. There was money behind it.

1789
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:09,040
There were political interest behind it.

1790
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:12,080
I talked to my pals and we saw this

1791
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,920
coming and tried to get, you know, major

1792
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,040
media outlets to take this seriously

1793
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,800
early on and they finally did. But I

1794
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,280
mean this

1795
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,239
this was upsetting because we saw it

1796
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,239
coming.

1797
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,880
related

1798
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,000
>> they're going to claim it's censorship.

1799
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,960
Yeah. [snorts]

1800
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,560
>> Yeah. Yeah. Uh asterisk to always like

1801
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,400
sort of look at the politics of it when

1802
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,040
there's a censorship claim is kind of

1803
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:39,360
what I was trying to put in. Um so

1804
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,800
somewhat related question. How do we

1805
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,880
distinguish between difference of

1806
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,400
opinion and disinformation especially

1807
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,280
when it comes to interpretation of

1808
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,840
current events? Example are people

1809
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,920
protesters or terrorists? Is something a

1810
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,880
war or a genocide? Those are two

1811
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:58,000
examples they're giving.

1812
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:00,320
>> I love that question.

1813
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,280
Um because and the reason I love that

1814
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,120
question is because I think that

1815
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,600
the best way to approach something like

1816
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,440
that is human face-to-face

1817
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,760
conversation.

1818
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,280
It's I mean online in the comment

1819
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,679
section,

1820
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:17,120
you're not going to get there. But if

1821
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:19,360
you're having a face-to-face

1822
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:22,400
conversation with somebody that you

1823
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:25,280
really disagree with,

1824
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:28,080
um, they're going to ask you, "What do

1825
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:31,600
you mean by terrorism?"

1826
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:34,560
H how, you know, we we disagree? Do we

1827
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,360
disagree over facts? Why do we disagree

1828
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,760
over the facts? What are your sources?

1829
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,719
One of my most powerful questions when

1830
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,400
I, you know, go out on the road, I'm not

1831
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,719
a physicist.

1832
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:50,480
I'm I'm you know I'm not an expert on

1833
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:52,719
climate change or vaccines

1834
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,640
but I'm a philosopher and so I will ask

1835
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:57,520
people

1836
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,520
why do you believe that

1837
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,280
more powerfully I ask them what evidence

1838
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,600
if I had it in my back pocket could

1839
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,760
change your mind that's the question

1840
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,320
that really flumxes them that's Carl

1841
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,719
Pauper's question the philosopher

1842
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:13,679
>> par excalance right because if you're

1843
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:15,760
really a scientist

1844
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,400
you would change your mind if somebody

1845
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:21,760
could produce compelling evidence. So

1846
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:24,159
tell me what is the evidence that if I

1847
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,400
had it could change your mind and if the

1848
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,719
person can't tell you what that evidence

1849
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,520
is

1850
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:34,239
then they're not a scientist and and

1851
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,560
that's that's a that's a moment that can

1852
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:40,159
only be appreciated in face-toface

1853
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:44,400
conversation. I think somebody somebody

1854
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:48,239
asked uh uh uh Theodore Dubzanski one

1855
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:50,640
time, eminent evolutionary biologist,

1856
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:54,080
what it would take for him to give up

1857
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:56,400
evolution by natural selection

1858
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:59,360
and he said rabbit fossils in the

1859
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,760
pre-Cambrian era.

1860
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:04,719
Pretty damn specific, right? Great

1861
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,960
answer. Great answer. I mean, so then

1862
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:10,560
you know,

1863
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:12,400
but so ask that of your conversation

1864
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,120
partner. What would it take to convince

1865
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,080
you of, you know, whatever the thing is?

1866
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,000
I I am really in I mean, look, it's not

1867
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:22,800
going to solve the problem. It's not

1868
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:27,280
sufficient to solve the problem. But I

1869
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:30,800
enjoy and I need to do more of

1870
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:32,880
face-to-face conversation because if

1871
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:36,400
people remember that disinformation

1872
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:40,320
doesn't just poison somebody's ability

1873
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:42,800
to reason, it makes them hate you.

1874
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,640
But it's hard to hate somebody face to

1875
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,199
face with a smile on their face who's

1876
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:50,400
curious about what you really think.

1877
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:53,040
somebody who will say to you, um, but

1878
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,719
why do you think that? Or or I would I

1879
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,840
say, well, I'm gonna ask you a hard

1880
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,440
question now. You know, I'm a

1881
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,719
philosopher. You you going to let me ask

1882
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,760
you a hard question? And they always

1883
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:05,280
say, oh, yeah, sure. I say, why do you

1884
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,960
think that? I mean, who who who

1885
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,719
told you that? And then they tell me,

1886
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,840
and I say, but but why do you trust

1887
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:13,679
them? You know, I mean, you can do that

1888
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,679
in person much better than you can in

1889
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:18,239
writing.

1890
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:21,280
I love that. That drives so much with my

1891
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:24,159
fieldwork with rural media, conservative

1892
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:26,719
media. I I But you have to also like be

1893
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:27,280
there and enjoy it on some level. Um

1894
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,960
yeah, anyway,

1895
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,920
>> if you're not if you're not enjoying it,

1896
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:34,239
you shouldn't be there. Uh there's a I

1897
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,159
have a um

1898
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:39,760
friends that I wrote about in the how to

1899
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:43,040
talk to a science book. um who run a

1900
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,560
their own tiny in tiny I mean I think

1901
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,880
they're running out of their dining room

1902
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,280
called hear yourself think and they go

1903
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:52,000
out to political rallies

1904
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:54,239
and present the opposite point of view

1905
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,560
and engage people in conversation and

1906
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:58,560
film it and then offer seminars about

1907
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,239
how to do it.

1908
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:04,880
Not angry spitting shouting

1909
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:07,040
conversations but real genuine

1910
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,440
connection conversations.

1911
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:11,199
>> Yeah. or for entertainment of the other

1912
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:14,159
side. Um

1913
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,679
>> yeah, absolutely. Um this is a direct

1914
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,480
followup in some ways to what you were

1915
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,199
just saying.

1916
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,199
>> Sure.

1917
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:21,040
>> How do you deal with deniers that have

1918
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,960
backgrounds in science and engineering

1919
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,440
yet they still insist on coming up with

1920
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,600
ways to dispute the evidence based on on

1921
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,040
their own view of the data or their own

1922
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,159
identity? I'm adding that in based on

1923
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:36,520
your book. Um example, making the

1924
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:36,520
statistics fit their own model.

1925
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:43,440
It's a a shocking fact that sometimes

1926
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:47,520
the most virilent deniers are the best

1927
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:50,400
educated ones because they know how to

1928
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:53,520
defend their point of view, they know

1929
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,520
the 16 studies that you haven't read yet

1930
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:58,800
or they can or when you say if you could

1931
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,639
show me such and such. I I did this one

1932
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:04,480
time. You know, they asked somebody

1933
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:06,400
asked me, "What would convince you that

1934
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:08,880
uh

1935
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:12,239
the MMR vaccine

1936
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:13,920
caused autism?" And I mentioned some

1937
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:16,639
specific

1938
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,719
thing and then they immediately shot me

1939
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:22,159
a study.

1940
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:23,679
Well, it was a flawed study, but by God,

1941
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,440
they had it at their fingertips. They

1942
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:28,320
were, you know, they were ready to go.

1943
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,960
So, what do I say to them? I mean, look,

1944
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,600
theoretically they sometimes they're the

1945
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,440
hardest because they're ready to go. I

1946
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:39,280
mean, they're, you know, they've they've

1947
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:41,120
got their arsenal, but they also might

1948
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,440
be

1949
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:45,600
open to the, you know, to your side of

1950
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,840
it if you've got the information as

1951
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,639
well. I remember that that exchange

1952
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:53,840
ended in something of a mutual

1953
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:55,520
understanding, not about that topic, but

1954
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,120
that we had a lot more in common because

1955
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,280
as the conversation went on, this was

1956
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,480
online, but as the conversation went on

1957
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,480
and on and on,

1958
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,440
>> it turned out that we had just a

1959
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:07,120
shocking amount in common from our

1960
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,719
background, the way we grew up, you

1961
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,560
know, I mean, it was just it was

1962
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:14,960
amazing.

1963
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:17,600
And so that that wall of hatred began to

1964
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:20,639
disappear. And by the way, uh, for me

1965
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,400
too, right, for for me to just not to

1966
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:26,159
say, "Oh, you're not worth my time.

1967
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:28,239
You're not worth talking to." Um, I I

1968
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,199
don't I don't like it when I feel that

1969
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,239
way.

1970
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:32,239
>> When I feel that, you know, like

1971
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:35,280
somebody's not worth talking to, because

1972
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:37,440
usually, I mean, unless somebody's a

1973
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,679
show, unless they're, you know, making

1974
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,840
money on it or something,

1975
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:44,080
>> there's something behind it. And

1976
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,159
sometimes it's fear.

1977
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,159
And if you really listen to somebody,

1978
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,840
vaccines is a good topic. If you really

1979
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:52,560
bother to sit down and just listen to

1980
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:55,040
why somebody's scared, they will tell

1981
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,159
you and they'll tell you what could

1982
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:00,400
convince them because what parent wants

1983
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:03,040
to put their child at risk? I mean they

1984
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:05,840
will you know you you can have a good

1985
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,440
conversation and there are instances in

1986
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:12,320
which scientists have convinced uh

1987
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:14,080
people to change their mind because you

1988
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,920
know through empathy through uh through

1989
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,480
listening that was in the in the earlier

1990
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,400
book not in on disinformation.

1991
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:22,239
how to convince other scientists. I

1992
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,000
mean, look,

1993
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:26,080
scientists should be the easiest to

1994
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,239
convince because

1995
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,440
we, you know, scientists are committed

1996
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:33,679
to being convinced by data and it is

1997
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,520
irrational to believe the hypothesis

1998
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:38,639
that has worse data over one that has

1999
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,239
better data.

2000
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:43,600
Some people kind of read themselves out

2001
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:45,840
of the profession or worse. Look,

2002
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,480
sometimes they go beyond like they're

2003
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:50,239
super eminent in this field and so

2004
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,159
they'll think, well, I'm so brilliant,

2005
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,159
you know, but I'll make this speculation

2006
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:56,320
on this other field or I have no

2007
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:58,719
credentials whatsoever. That's

2008
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,800
sometimes, you know, a factor, too. But

2009
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,760
I mean, scientists should be easiest to

2010
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,639
convince

2011
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,560
>> if they embrace

2012
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,719
the scientific attitude, I call it,

2013
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,239
which is to care about evidence and be

2014
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:13,360
willing to change your mind on the basis

2015
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:15,040
of evidence. If they've got that, you

2016
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,400
should be able, you know, to convince

2017
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,000
them with evidence. Doesn't always

2018
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,159
happen.

2019
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,360
>> Well, this is the third in a tree of

2020
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,760
questions that I think are all very

2021
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,280
related. Um, and it follows up again.

2022
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,800
So, how do you have a debate with

2023
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,280
someone about a topic that you're not an

2024
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,239
expert on, but you know it's true.

2025
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,040
>> Um,

2026
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,040
>> uh, have I got

2027
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:36,480
>> So, say you aren't a scientist.

2028
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:40,320
>> Yeah. Have I got an article for you? Um,

2029
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:42,480
in nature human behavior 2019, there is

2030
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,000
an article by Cornelia Bich and Philip

2031
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,960
Schmid.

2032
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,560
I forget the title of the article, but

2033
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:53,440
they did an empirical study of two ways

2034
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:56,560
of interacting with science deniers. One

2035
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:58,960
was called content rebuttal where you

2036
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:02,320
present them with the facts and the

2037
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:06,239
other was technique rebuttal where you

2038
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:08,639
recognize that deniers all

2039
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:11,040
follow the same blueprint. They

2040
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:14,639
cherrypick evidence. They're conspiracy

2041
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:16,239
theorists. They are illogical reasoners.

2042
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:19,199
They believe in fake experts and they

2043
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:22,080
think science has to be perfect. But if

2044
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:25,199
you understand those five points, they

2045
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:27,360
talk in that article about how you can

2046
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:29,280
engage whether you have specific content

2047
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,440
knowledge or not. Here's the brilliant

2048
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:33,199
thing about their study and and why I I

2049
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,520
mean I wrote about this study in my in

2050
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:37,280
my book.

2051
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,360
They found that technique rebuttal was

2052
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,800
just as effective as content rebuttal.

2053
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,280
So, I mean, I'm not disrespecting

2054
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,920
anybody who got a PhD, you know, in

2055
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:48,080
whatever, but a lay person who

2056
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,280
understands how technique rebuttal works

2057
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:54,480
can be just as effective in talking to

2058
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:55,840
somebody who who's a denier,

2059
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,360
which means that we don't have an

2060
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,719
excuse. We can't say, "Oh, the

2061
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,679
scientists ought to be out there doing

2062
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:03,120
it."

2063
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:04,880
>> You know, I I I mean, look, you you're a

2064
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,000
scientist. You're a sociologist. You

2065
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,239
know, you're you're a scientist. I'm a

2066
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,639
philosopher. I'm not a scientist, but I

2067
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:12,320
understand technique rebuttal because I

2068
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,800
understand, you know, those five steps

2069
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:17,360
and, you know, I mean, illogical

2070
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,360
reasoning, you know, cherry-picking. Uh,

2071
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:22,080
uh, yeah, I I understand how to do that.

2072
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:25,600
So, that's the energy that I go in with.

2073
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:29,920
So, put your mind at ease. Not only can

2074
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:33,040
you use that, it's just as effective as

2075
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,440
if you were a scientist.

2076
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:38,480
>> That's a great note for us to to end on,

2077
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:39,040
I think. an optimistic or hopeful note.

2078
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,440
Um,

2079
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,960
>> hopeful.

2080
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,480
>> I'm going to turn it. Yeah, hopeful.

2081
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,560
Thank you so much, Lee. I'm gonna turn

2082
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,120
it over to Ka to close things out for

2083
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,040
us.

2084
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,880
>> Great questions. Thank you to everybody

2085
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,440
and to you, Rebecca.

2086
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,480
>> Yes. Thank you both, Lee and Rebecca,

2087
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:57,199
for such a provocative conversation and

2088
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:59,199
questions and answers from the audience.

2089
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:01,920
Thank you for engaging and for showing

2090
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:03,920
up this evening and for wanting to learn

2091
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,719
more about this topic and what we can do

2092
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:09,840
in the world to mitigate some of these

2093
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:12,239
challenges that we are moving through in

2094
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,719
this present time. As a reminder for

2095
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:16,560
those in the MIT community, we will host

2096
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:19,520
a lunch and community discussion

2097
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:23,520
tomorrow, October 9th, at 12 PM noon in

2098
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:25,120
the Hayden Library Nexus. And I want to

2099
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,360
thank you again for joining us virtually

2100
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,679
for this evening's presentation. I hope

2101
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:32,159
you all have a great evening. I hope you

2102
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:36,400
enjoy your dinners. This now concludes

2103
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:36,400
our event. Good night.
