00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,080
good morning everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,319
another installment of the mpg primer

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,000
Series today it's my pleasure to

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,080
introduce uh yon wrong uh she is a staff

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,519
scientist in prdeep nagar rajin lab

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,160
within the medical and population

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,160
genetics program at the broad she's an

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,039
expert in polygenic risk scores or prss

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,760
and their applications to diverse

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,279
populations her research on PRS began

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,279
during her PhD at Kings College London

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,520
where she developed PR PRS methodology

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,200
under the mentorship of Professor Paul

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,680
O'Reilly building on her PhD work she

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
continued This research during during

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,160
postgraduate training at the broad

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,800
collaborating with um halang Wang and

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:51,280
Tian Tian thank you uh to develop P PRS

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,280
CSX an Innovative multi-population PRS

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,680
method currently her research focuses on

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,079
applying PRS to diverse and AD miix

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,559
populations and leveraging these PRS

23
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,719
methods to study

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080
disease uh she has said that questions

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
are welcome throughout the talk so

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,720
please come up to the mic so everyone in

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
the room and online can hear you um and

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,840
the title of our talk today is PRS

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,799
methods development and their

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,640
application thank you thank you thank

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,920
you for the nice introduction and thank

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,360
you for everyone to come here so early

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,920
in such a cold weather um so I'm going

34
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,960
to talk about uh PRS Masters and uh it's

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,960
kind of uh hard to choose a specific

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,920
topic because there are already so many

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,000
different methods to to calculate the

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,920
PRS and it's hard to choose the best one

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,799
because as I know in the uh real

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,840
application like each method may have

41
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,159
their own like a a more uh favorable uh

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,079
situation so I'm going just going

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,560
through the uh all the main idea about

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,759
how as a master

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,840
development about what is important

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,600
about that method and I also put the

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,800
information of the paper so if you are

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,680
particularly interested in any specific

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,519
um uh method you can look up the paper

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,760
or like you can email me we can discuss

51
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:23,200
but in this talk in general I'm just

52
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,040
give you a structure to help you to see

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,640
how we get all these

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:33,560
methods so uh so the PRS

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,360
um the PRS is like I think it's like

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:42,080
almost nearly to say is it can we use it

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:48,239
as a proy of common snip uh genetic

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,400
burden and it's uh the ma the mass part

59
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,360
is very simple is

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,560
a with the sum of risk Le with the

61
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:02,560
weight being the uh risk Le effect size

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,440
so today we I'm going to divide this

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,799
part into four parts inventing

64
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,480
calculating improving and standardizing

65
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:14,319
and applying PRS so inventing PRS

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,080
actually this is a story like maybe

67
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,560
started a little bit earlier than you my

68
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,760
thought so back in

69
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,000
2009 uh when we still kind of like in

70
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,000
the darkness about what the all the

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,319
psychiatric disease uh is are they like

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,159
a hitable or they purely from uh

73
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,040
environmental or education this type of

74
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,760
stuff so back then they gathered the

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,400
largest possible sample which is

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,360
nowadays may be kind of like a weird

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:55,280
like three, cases and 3,000 control and

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,799
of course we have no uh genome wide

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,360
significant heat like anywhere and the

80
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:07,920
most signicant heat is have this P value

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:12,159
of uh 0 point sorry uh uh 10 minor uh

82
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,880
six so back then people are kind of

83
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:20,479
like nervous and confusing should we put

84
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,919
more uh energy and the uh funding to uh

85
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,520
continue investigate into the genetic

86
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:31,080
aspect of the psychiatric disease so

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:35,120
then some very uh creative uh researcher

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:39,720
come up with our hero like a PRS so they

89
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,160
inventing PRS as a proof of uh genetic

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:48,400
polygenic genetic basis so even though

91
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,360
none of the sneff hit the uh genomewide

92
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,800
significant threshold but the P value

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,759
they calculated like

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,199
schizophrenia uh PRS pre uh uh uh

95
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,280
predicting uh

96
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,039
schizophrenia have a very very

97
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,720
significant P value as you see like 10

98
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,680
minus uh

99
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,440
28

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,120
and besides that they also uh have some

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,680
like a positive versus negative controls

102
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,479
they use the schizophrenia pris to

103
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,440
predict a highly correlated trade which

104
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,039
is a bipolar and they also see a

105
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,199
significant

106
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,319
correlation but when they predict the

107
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,479
non psychiatric disease like heart

108
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,400
disease uh Cron's disease and the type

109
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,360
two diabetes you can see like none of

110
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,199
this like a um Association is

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,240
significant so basically they show that

112
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:53,479
uh the PRS can be used as a

113
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,840
genetic uh like a appr proxy appr proxy

114
00:05:53,479 --> 00:06:00,080
of genetic basis and is quite specific

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,960
to the disease or to the type of disease

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,160
is so here is the summary of the first

117
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,520
part so PRS can serve as a proxy of

118
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,199
genetic burden even when the S stat uh

119
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,800
statistics are

120
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,680
underpowered so let's go to the next

121
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,680
part the uh calculating the PRS how are

122
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,240
we

123
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,800
calculating the PRS score so uh I'll

124
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,319
just like a

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:35,160
uh first like a still go through all

126
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:39,639
these like a terms and here I will use

127
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:44,639
the uh like a the term discover

128
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,880
Discovery uh data to uh represent the

129
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,280
summary statis was I provide the

130
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:55,919
marginal SN effect size and uh then like

131
00:06:51,280 --> 00:07:01,000
a in the PRS method we adjust the L uh

132
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:03,400
structure and gets the uh adjusted uh

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,720
effect size and we use a data called

134
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:11,720
fine tuning data to choose the uh most

135
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:16,240
predictive PRS model and then like uh in

136
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,840
the testing data we uh do all this

137
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,000
Downstream analysis like a predicting

138
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,400
the trade with a PRS or some other um uh

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,759
some other

140
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:32,360
analysis and uh here are all this like

141
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,120
uh it's actually just a small part of

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,360
the existing method that we can use to

143
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:44,000
uh calculating the PRS and there some

144
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,240
like a uh type of the of it I Al also

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,680
list like the for each time I'll just

146
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,960
like at list one or two example so the

147
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,280
most naive one is the clamping and the P

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:59,560
value thres holding sometimes we call it

149
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,879
uh CT or PT like they use clamping and

150
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:07,599
pruning here interchangeably so PT or uh

151
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,520
CT method and uh besides that we have

152
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,639
bent methods like we adjust the the

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,080
effect size using some like

154
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,520
bent uh uh method and also like a

155
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:24,400
penalized regression and also uh there's

156
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,759
a like a a mixed linear

157
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,039
regression plus patient method that

158
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,919
based on the individual level data like

159
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:37,560
uh both hmm

160
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:42,240
so uh here I only like mainly focusing

161
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,360
on the uh uh CT method and the I'll

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,080
briefly talking about the B

163
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,760
methods uh so the C method or clamping

164
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,120
and P value thresh holding is the most

165
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,839
naive and still uh commonly use the

166
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:02,000
method so here is like a

167
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:05,959
the the the the pipeline of how you can

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,399
calculate the te TRS so I just show like

169
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:16,839
an over simplified example of like the

170
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:20,519
uh uh of the the gwos data mahattan plot

171
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:23,959
uh we can see that like uh in in this

172
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,720
part of the the the the the genome we

173
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:30,600
have three AUD blocks and from each Audi

174
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,560
blocks we choose the most significant

175
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,399
sniff or the lead sniff which which is

176
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,360
the clamping and then we can

177
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:44,160
test several

178
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,000
uh several different P values threshold

179
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,480
to decide which sneep to

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,920
keep and uh and so as we can see as the

181
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,519
uh P value uh threshold be more relaxed

182
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:04,279
we will include more snip into uh the

183
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,920
the the PRS method so basically the

184
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,880
um

185
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:13,399
the the MTH of the the PRS is kind of

186
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,640
like can be written like this if you uh

187
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,440
have the lead snip and that snip have

188
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,519
the P value that pass the threshold and

189
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,800
then you just keep the marginal effect

190
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,160
size as it otherwise every marginal

191
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,760
effect has just shrink to the zero so

192
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,959
basically idea of this method is like we

193
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:38,839
use the Le PRS to represent the codal uh

194
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:42,560
sorry the Le s to represent the Cod

195
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,320
SES so here is a kind of like a summary

196
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,000
of this method so it's a hard thres

197
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,760
holding method it only keep one this

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,839
snip in each LD block and we keep the

199
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,399
marginal effect size as as it is if like

200
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,519
it is the significant lead snip and on

201
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,639
the other hand we have a more

202
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,079
complicated method B method so basically

203
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,519
it's kind of you can understand it as a

204
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:12,560
shrinkage method it will keep multiple

205
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:15,680
snip in one LD block and it will shrink

206
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,200
the uh effect size of each snip

207
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,000
according to the L information and the

208
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,920
also Assumption of what the true

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,680
distribution of the effect size

210
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:33,160
is so this the two like a the summary of

211
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:37,320
this two m and I will just uh show one

212
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:42,079
example of patient method like mostly

213
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:44,279
the B method just vary by they have

214
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,079
different assumption about the true

215
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:53,639
effect size so the uh here is like I'll

216
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:57,200
show the method that my uh uh my

217
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:01,600
supervisor Tang developed is called prcs

218
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:05,680
CS for continuous drinking cage and uh

219
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,880
uh oops sorry I and like it adjusts the

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,160
the E size of course according to the LD

221
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,480
and the the assumption is that the E

222
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,880
siid follow a normal distribution and

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,839
the the center deviation part con

224
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:28,360
contain two like a a group of parameter

225
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:32,480
one group is the the show shows as the

226
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,160
sigma squared is the overall variations

227
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,040
and the other is

228
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,760
a is kind of like a a shrinkage me that

229
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,920
sorry a shrinkage parameter that roughly

230
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,720
you can understand this as it roughly

231
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,639
represents the likelihood of a

232
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,639
sniff uh being the codal Sniff and uh

233
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,279
that's this uh that's like a uh

234
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,760
parameter

235
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,920
uh F or side I sorry I can't remember so

236
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,040
follows a distribution called gamma

237
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,760
gamma and the shape of the gamma gamma

238
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,959
you

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,519
can uh see on the plot shows with this

240
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:17,519
like a a yellow curve and compared with

241
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:21,399
the the uh like the the the normal

242
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,480
distribution we show it in the the dash

243
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,880
the black line is have a sharper Spike

244
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,760
around zero and a fatter tail on each

245
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,680
side so it can

246
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:38,279
have a more realistic representative of

247
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:42,680
like most of the um the the the snip

248
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:48,000
could be like a just non Cal but the uh

249
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:50,440
for the the the Cal uh the Cal sne like

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,920
the the amount of CNE may be like a

251
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,399
larger than what the uh normal

252
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,160
distribution would

253
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,880
assume uh and like if you are interested

254
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,519
is like I I can just let you know like

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,360
after you have this assumption you may

256
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:12,800
just like do the calculation using some

257
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:17,360
like a ma uh like a a mathematical like

258
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:20,160
trick like a mcmc m col uh Mark of chain

259
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,360
or other methods but I'm not going to

260
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,600
spend more time like to explain all this

261
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,680
like mathematical trick so in summary to

262
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,519
calculate the pris we Main adjust the

263
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,759
the marginal effect size observed in the

264
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,759
discovery G was uh for the a structure

265
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,560
we

266
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,680
can use the most naive uh method

267
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,959
clumping and P value thread holding or

268
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:53,440
more uh complicated method like Bion

269
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:57,800
methods and uh also improving PRS so

270
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:02,560
this is like a a large part of my uh uh

271
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:05,839
post PhD and the post do so I guess we

272
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,040
are going to we already seen this plug

273
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,480
for like almost 100 of times so we know

274
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,440
that the uh the current G was is like

275
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,280
over represented the over representing

276
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,360
the European population but uh uh to get

277
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:28,600
[Music]

278
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:32,680
a accurate PRS we are relying on the G G

279
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,240
was matched the population so all the uh

280
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,199
like the the non European uh population

281
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:43,199
are like uh suffer from a less accurate

282
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,319
PRS accuracy and the the field has been

283
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:49,600
like constantly working on how to

284
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:52,600
improve the uh the accuracy for non

285
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,680
European populations based on uh

286
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,839
whatever data we can

287
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:02,240
have and uh the reason that is we have

288
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,480
this like a low transfer ability of the

289
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,480
PRS is like of course the LD is

290
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,399
different and also we may have some

291
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,560
population specific uh Cal sneps that

292
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,440
are not uh be that that are almost

293
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,319
impossible to measure in European

294
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,880
population and also different population

295
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:23,759
have different environmental factors and

296
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:29,639
like went through different like s like

297
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:33,360
a natural selection uh uh and extra

298
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,399
but here we mainly focusing on the Audi

299
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,560
difference and I'll explain why the Audi

300
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,839
difference can lower the PRS

301
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:46,800
transferability across population and

302
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:50,560
how how we can solve this problem so uh

303
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,399
why it when we use like for example the

304
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,880
European population to predict a

305
00:16:52,399 --> 00:17:00,319
non-european population the PRS accuracy

306
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,639
just Dro that much and uh major uh

307
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:05,600
reason is the Audi difference for

308
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,439
example in the clumping and P value s

309
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,799
holding we as we mentioned before we use

310
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,240
the significant lead snip as a proxy of

311
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:18,400
codal snips however like

312
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,400
the because of the A's structure the

313
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,559
lead snip are not necessarily the Cod

314
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,480
snip and also because the LD difference

315
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:33,400
in different population the relationship

316
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:36,480
between the uh the lead snip and the Cod

317
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,440
snip are could be different and the

318
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,559
different population can have different

319
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:47,679
col Snips so um and besides that like

320
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:51,120
the uh effect size of the Le snip can

321
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:55,520
suffer from the Winner's curse which is

322
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:59,919
like it's like a inflated because we we

323
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:04,919
choose the most significant uh snip

324
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:08,720
so uh the lead n set we we select it

325
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:13,080
from uh one population may not as

326
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,120
relevant about with that uh trait in

327
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,039
another population so that's why we can

328
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,679
see this like a the drop of uh PRS

329
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,440
accuracy

330
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:28,120
or uh or low PRS

331
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,559
transferability so how can we do better

332
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,760
than this so one solution is just like

333
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,400
we use some more

334
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,760
complicated uh PRS method for example

335
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:45,000
the Bion method because this method can

336
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:48,400
include more uh snip in uh in the genome

337
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,679
so like uh it will be less sensitive to

338
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,679
like the the the in uh in cons

339
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,320
inconsistency uh of the little s in

340
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:04,440
different population and also uh we kind

341
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,240
of uh we adjusted the size so we uh

342
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,159
partially solve the problem of the

343
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:14,679
winers curse and of course we need to

344
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:16,600
combine more uh gwos data we can have

345
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,200
kind we can think of better way to do

346
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,440
the combination or just combine more

347
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,280
data or we can include other information

348
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,000
so all this like uh the combination part

349
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,400
and also include more information part I

350
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,120
will just show you how we do that in the

351
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,919
field by some

352
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:42,880
example so uh the for first the better

353
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:46,960
combination method I'll just uh

354
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,880
shamelessly sh my own word

355
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,440
SSX uh and also I'll also mention

356
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,440
another method that I find very

357
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:59,440
interesting uh super learning method and

358
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:03,120
uh so the PSS X is an

359
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,760
extension of the previous master

360
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,880
prscs and it's uh what it's doing is

361
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,360
like uh we are trying to more

362
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,000
efficiently combine information across

363
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,480
different population so what's about

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,320
combining the uh different combining the

365
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,480
information across population so uh we

366
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,000
we think that the naive combination me

367
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,679
usually using some oversimplified

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,080
assumption for example when we

369
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,400
use uh when we have a very strong

370
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,559
Assumption of about the marginal effect

371
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:46,320
size which is like we running we run the

372
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:50,080
uh meta analysis of of of two population

373
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,440
we actually assume that despite all this

374
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,159
difference these two population have the

375
00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:00,200
same marginal effect size and then like

376
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:04,000
after we have this uh

377
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,799
meod this method G was we can just like

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,440
adjust the if size according to for

379
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,559
example either uh the AL of population a

380
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:18,279
or Al of population b or some other like

381
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:21,360
U uh uh like AUD panel we made and then

382
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:25,440
we choose the we can choose the best uh

383
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:29,520
uh uh SN from all these like method and

384
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,480
get the final result or we can just have

385
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,360
no

386
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,200
assumption which we will call it the the

387
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
the the

388
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,200
multi method so the multi me is just

389
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,799
like a because they we have no

390
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:48,000
assumption we just view Each G was as in

391
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:52,559
independent we just run the uh the whole

392
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,400
PRS process uh as if we only have the

393
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,240
information of that one population and

394
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:03,799
from each uh population G was we get a

395
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:08,039
set of PRS and finally we do the linear

396
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:12,120
combination to combine these two PRS so

397
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:15,360
as a summary like The Meta method kind

398
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,039
of consider okay the different

399
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,840
population have some should have some

400
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:23,679
shared genetic

401
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,880
architecture but the way they model this

402
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,039
shared genetic architecture is not

403
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,159
efficiently but and mul population uh

404
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,159
just never consider that but on the

405
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,039
other hand the motive uh um method

406
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,480
consider the L difference and the

407
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:44,080
population specific effect size when the

408
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,880
meta method didn't consider so none of

409
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,960
them are like good

410
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,640
enough and uh also according to other

411
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,200
research we know that we should consider

412
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,919
the genetic uh shared genetic

413
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,760
architecture because uh from the

414
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,520
previous results we know that the

415
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,080
genetic correlation cross population of

416
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,360
the same uh traits is usually very high

417
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,320
and so a better assumption is that we

418
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,640
when we do this combination we should

419
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,880
assume that different population share

420
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,080
the same codos s and the F size are like

421
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:25,200
kind of largely correlated so here is

422
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:29,039
how we model this this better assumption

423
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,000
so just a recap in the PRS method do we

424
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:37,960
have all this stuff like we consider the

425
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,080
LD uh structure and do we uh as assume

426
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,840
the true effect side follow this

427
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,360
distribution and the the the

428
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,880
distribution contains contains two type

429
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:53,840
of uh uh two type of like a parameters

430
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:59,320
and some parameters like uh uh models

431
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:03,679
the likelihood of the sneff being coal

432
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:07,120
so uh but for the mul for for the

433
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,240
multiple population and we if we use the

434
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,720
the multi method like all the parameter

435
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,360
are popul

436
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:19,320
specific so in the PRS

437
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:23,080
CSX we keep everything else still

438
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:26,279
being uh population specific but this

439
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,480
parameter that model the likelihood or

440
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,399
roughly models the likelihood of a sneak

441
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:37,960
being caal is shared across population

442
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:39,760
so then we have this like a uh method we

443
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:44,000
called couple the

444
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:48,600
prior which basically means like a like

445
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,679
the the the assume the true as

446
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,159
distribution are kind of like correlated

447
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,720
for the different population and so are

448
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,640
you yeah can I ask a a quick question I

449
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,440
with hopefully not derailing you about

450
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,240
using this word population I was

451
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,000
wondering if you could Define what how

452
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,919
how does an investigator figure out what

453
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,279
to call a population when do you want to

454
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,159
make it more granular and when can it be

455
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:16,320
helpful versus hurtful to lump

456
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:22,120
versus uh yeah that's a good question so

457
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:25,559
for like uh just for the the context of

458
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,640
like a calculating the PRS for for now

459
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:32,240
like I'm talking about like a I would

460
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:36,640
just say like literally like a by

461
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:40,760
population it's just like a group of uh

462
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,679
individual that their L follow a certain

463
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,799
pattern or at least like of course this

464
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,760
is a very very over oversimplified

465
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,760
explanation for the population but uh

466
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,200
just for sake of calculating PS here

467
00:25:52,760 --> 00:26:01,159
this is how I would use this

468
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:06,360
term I admit it's kind of very very over

469
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:08,320
simplified okay um is that okay

470
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,760
so

471
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,480
um so uh so from

472
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,880
the uh using this cuple prior from from

473
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,799
the uh Discovery Discovery G was from

474
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,960
each population we have a like a adjust

475
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,360
a set of adjusted adjusted effect size

476
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,279
and based on that adjusted effect size

477
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,880
we calculate the PRS and uh we finally

478
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,159
like a a linear combine linearly combine

479
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,080
this two PRS as the final PRS and here

480
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:45,960
is the some uh results we tested this

481
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,960
this method and compare it with

482
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:53,279
other existing method back then uh using

483
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,919
uh simulation data we can see that for

484
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,279
both like a we simulate a scenario when

485
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,919
we have a larger European GW was and the

486
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,559
smaller African G was and we can see

487
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,600
that for both predicting European and

488
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,880
predicting uh Africa like uh the green

489
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,799
bars which represent

490
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:17,799
the uh PRS accuracy when we combine the

491
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:23,080
two G was is in general uh more accurate

492
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:25,200
than using a the single uh using the

493
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,960
single population G was and especially

494
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:33,080
like the uh the African

495
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,679
uh Target like benefit most from the

496
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,080
combination of the GW was and we can see

497
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:43,000
that from all the

498
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:46,159
different uh combination methods sorry

499
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,240
uh the our method PSX perform the best

500
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:55,399
and we also uh like uh repeated this

501
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:58,960
test in um in B Bank data uh so here we

502
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:03,600
just show the a relative accuracy

503
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:09,679
compared with only using the uh European

504
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:12,559
GS which here oops and we can see that

505
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,240
like uh uh by adding more and more uh

506
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,080
population the uh the PRS accuracy

507
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,399
increase and also like we can see that

508
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:29,440
uh our method PRS CSX performs better

509
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:32,480
than like uh other methods but but also

510
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,360
uh as a like the the author of this

511
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,440
method I know this this method or this

512
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,640
type of like a uh combination method

513
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,519
have its limitation uh because when we

514
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,200
combining more than one trait or when we

515
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:51,760
combine say five populations the shared

516
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,919
codos assumption may not hold because

517
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,240
like the more population you have you

518
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,000
get the more likely you will have some

519
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,440
population specific uh uh population

520
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,720
specific C snip and of course for

521
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,960
different tra the CN should be different

522
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:12,279
and also the computation time will also

523
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:16,080
increase when we include more GW so the

524
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:20,559
com if say we com we want to combine say

525
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:24,720
20 G was the computation time of prss X

526
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:28,600
could be quite long so

527
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,039
uh that's the limitation and and how to

528
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,480
fix it I'll mention it later and also

529
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,039
like I'll also meure some other uh

530
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,720
method that can do the better

531
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,399
combination which is a super learn I ask

532
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,279
a question before we move to Super

533
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:46,480
learning methods uh this is online

534
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,600
looking at the meta or multi the

535
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,120
different methods um it takes into

536
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,640
account the different populations but

537
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,279
what about differences in the gws design

538
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,440
like the way the cases and control were

539
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,279
selected does it account for those

540
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,519
differences as well and sad please

541
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:07,200
correct me if I um asked that

542
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,640
incorrectly um

543
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,960
the

544
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,320
uh because it's not just the case it's

545
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,200
not just the populations that are

546
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,799
different the selection of cases and

547
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,279
controls or the imbalance like the way

548
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,679
the gwas was designed might be different

549
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:26,120
between those and that might cause um

550
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:32,399
some heterogenity between the

551
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:38,159
two yes I totally agree and uh uh

552
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:40,960
for like for example like in I'm not

553
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,039
quite sure whether like this question is

554
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,120
about how should we address that

555
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:51,240
question so I I mean that problem exist

556
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:55,799
but so maybe like uh

557
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:58,480
um like if you really con concern that

558
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:01,360
the marginal effecta size May really not

559
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:07,080
be that consistent maybe you can just

560
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:11,240
try more on to the uh multimod or the P

561
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:16,480
PRX method that can better model the

562
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:18,120
like G was specific uh effect size is

563
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,960
that

564
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:25,240
what

565
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:28,679
okay yeah um and if I'm not quite sure I

566
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,840
can really address all this question

567
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:33,279
very efficiently so if you want

568
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:38,279
clarification please feel free to email

569
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:40,120
me um okay I have uh one more online

570
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,000
okay are there any PRS methods right now

571
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,360
that are based on statistical find

572
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,360
mapping for example from Susie since

573
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,679
those variants might um are more likely

574
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,840
I I I remember there's a method but I

575
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:57,399
didn't like put it in to my slide there

576
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,639
there is a method like using the fing

577
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:04,399
information yeah thank you

578
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:08,760
um and also the super learning method is

579
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,880
kind of like a just so to be brief it's

580
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,440
like a conventionally we only choose the

581
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,320
best set of adjust effect size from each

582
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,760
GW but the support learning is like we

583
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,799
can uh is combine the different set of

584
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:27,399
adjust effect sides to further increase

585
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:31,880
the uh the information we can like

586
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:35,760
extract from each G was so that's a

587
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,080
point and this is one of method that use

588
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,559
uh the super learning methods and uh

589
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:46,240
okay I'm going to address what if we

590
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:53,519
want to combine say like a few dozens of

591
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:58,039
uh GS so uh for now like we uh in our in

592
00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:00,080
our la like uh we developed two

593
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:03,320
actually one type of two different

594
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:07,679
methods to do this combination and I'll

595
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,880
just show one example like a GPS mode so

596
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,080
basically it's like com do the

597
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,240
combination in two layer first layer is

598
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,919
like we combine like

599
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,320
say uh

600
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,919
fiveish uh different G was from

601
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,600
different population but of same trait

602
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,600
together and the second layer is like

603
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,440
from each trait uh

604
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,799
uh PRS we then do the combination and

605
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,679
within each layer we do first do a

606
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,279
feature selection which uh you can you

607
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,440
can understand that as like we remove

608
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,320
some redundant underpowered GW was from

609
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,799
the model and next we do a linear

610
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,840
combination of the GW was based on the

611
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:56,559
selected powerful

612
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:00,760
uh DS and the result is that by doing

613
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:04,519
this like com all this combination of

614
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:08,040
method which show in the red uh in the

615
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,320
red do and bar like is more accurate

616
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,800
than previously published

617
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,280
PRS and also there we can try to con

618
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,839
include other

619
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:25,119
information um so there are

620
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:27,760
several I'll just give two example so

621
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,919
basically by including other information

622
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,599
I mean we can treat the different region

623
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,800
differently for example give some region

624
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:40,520
a higher weight based on the information

625
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,359
of like a gen set annotation biological

626
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:47,119
function and so some extra we can be

627
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:49,760
creative and thinking about all this

628
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,560
information to be include so we can so

629
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,960
the

630
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,160
PRS uh peret method is like doing the

631
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,200
um the like

632
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,040
give the PRS weight slightly differently

633
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,040
according to the Gen set annotation and

634
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,960
uh also there's another method called

635
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,240
xwing which includes the local genetic

636
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,960
correlation into the model which means

637
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,720
like the more

638
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,160
similar

639
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,359
uh uh part of the genome across

640
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,720
different population should treat

641
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:25,960
differently than the less less similar

642
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,400
part of the

643
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,599
genome and so as a summary so to

644
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,520
increase PRS accuracy for diverse

645
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,359
populations we combine information from

646
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,599
different uh population different tra

647
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,400
annotation and all these other

648
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,240
informations and also the the final part

649
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,400
the stand the standardizing and the

650
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:53,240
applying the PRS which we have some good

651
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,240
news and bad news the good news is like

652
00:35:53,240 --> 00:36:00,720
a PRS can really do a lot of things so I

653
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,280
list the several application of PRS in

654
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,240
like a basic scientific research we can

655
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,880
use the PRS uh either based on the whole

656
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,560
genome or based on part of the genome to

657
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:18,640
predict the disease or subtype of the

658
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:21,720
disease we can use the uh PRS uh

659
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:27,079
sorry I so we can use the

660
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:29,560
PRS uh as a instead of the the snip as a

661
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,560
as a

662
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:37,040
uh uh of the to to be the uh instrument

663
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,079
variation in Mandan randomization and we

664
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,119
can use the PRS as to

665
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,440
uh uh analyze all this interaction

666
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,640
either with the environmental or like

667
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,640
the rear

668
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,160
variance

669
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,040
and there could be even more as the

670
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,839
field developed and also how close we

671
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,560
are to apply the PS in clinic there are

672
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:05,880
some also very promising results showing

673
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:10,440
that uh in we can really use the PRS to

674
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:14,240
help in the like a uh in like clinical

675
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,119
trial to see that the PRS can help us to

676
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,640
identify uh the younger

677
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,480
individual uh which around the

678
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,960
borderline or in

679
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:28,079
inmedia uh clinical risk uh to to

680
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,960
determine whether they should uh

681
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,119
uh start therapy earlier than as

682
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,119
suggested by uh

683
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,000
conventional prediction

684
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:42,800
model and uh also we have some kind of

685
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,240
like a bad news it's like the current

686
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,040
PRS is kind of like cohort specific the

687
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:53,880
if we're just looking at the RO PRS

688
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:57,880
value uh is kind of like uh it's all it

689
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,720
only makes sense in each specific uh

690
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:05,520
cohort for example if we

691
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:09,280
calculating the RO PRS across different

692
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,000
uh population we can see that uh even

693
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,560
like our everyday experience telling us

694
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,920
maybe like the African population and

695
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,720
the the European population roughly have

696
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,720
similar age Heights but uh the PRS of

697
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,920
African populations is can be much lower

698
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,160
than the uh European population and also

699
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:35,319
or like uh data tell us like across the

700
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:38,599
whole globally the uh prevalence of the

701
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:41,240
schizophrenia are quite consistent but

702
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:46,240
also the distribution of RS could be

703
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:50,440
like a uh very very wildly so we cannot

704
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:54,760
directly use the RS across cohort which

705
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:58,040
can be a problem and also the PRS uh

706
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,640
weights uh have inconsistent accuracy in

707
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,400
different population as we mentioned

708
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:07,640
before the low transferability and

709
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:10,920
the here is another represent is that uh

710
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:15,319
we it has the same K Weight and we can

711
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:21,440
see the uh the accuracy just drop almost

712
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:25,240
linearly as the uh genetic distance

713
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:29,480
increase and uh there are some way we

714
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,560
can try to part maybe partially fix the

715
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,119
problem so for example the different

716
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,040
population have different role PS

717
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:38,240
distribution we can just regress all the

718
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,400
PC so they have more uniform

719
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,960
distribution and laterly I developed the

720
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,359
method that can uh like that uh

721
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,640
interpolate PRS across the whole

722
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:53,119
spectrum of the PCA so instead of like

723
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,920
just

724
00:39:53,119 --> 00:40:01,079
um like fine tuning the PRS model in the

725
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:06,119
match the population I fine tune the PRS

726
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:08,680
in different single ancestry cohort and

727
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:12,400
use their PCA information to

728
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:15,800
interpretate the PRS for diverse uh

729
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,040
admixed individual and in our test we

730
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:22,440
can see

731
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:26,319
that so this plot shows the uh relative

732
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:29,359
increase of the the interpret data

733
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:32,599
versus the uh

734
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:35,560
pris uh created by the conventional data

735
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:39,119
we can see that the the interpretated

736
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:44,280
data have uh similar or and sometimes

737
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:46,760
slightly better accuracy than the PRS uh

738
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,200
like created by the conventional data

739
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,599
which is like finding with a match the

740
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,720
population and if you're interested here

741
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:59,400
is the uh here is the the

742
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:02,720
preprint um so yes we can partially

743
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:07,160
address this incon inconsistency but

744
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,359
still like there are uh like so this is

745
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,599
like just addressing the inconsistency

746
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:16,280
using the PCA popul PCA information

747
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:20,560
however like some other uh research show

748
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:25,400
that the PRS performance can be

749
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:28,640
influenced by other factors I will just

750
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:32,440
show here the the the of take- Home

751
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,319
message uh from this paper I sorry part

752
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,520
of the take- home message uh so the

753
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:41,800
context such as like age sex income can

754
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:46,400
impact the PRS

755
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,839
accuracy um with the same uh magnitude

756
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,599
as a genetic

757
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:55,200
ancestry

758
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:58,599
um so there are all this uh Factor we

759
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,440
need to uh consider if we want to

760
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:04,480
further increase the PRS prediction

761
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:09,040
accuracy and also there are some other

762
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:13,000
limitations so uh uh despite we have

763
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:17,520
already some like almost saturated P for

764
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,720
uh for the uh con TR like height but for

765
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,680
a lot of complex disease the PRS

766
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:29,160
accuracy is still quite uh limited and

767
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,400
also we also notice that the PRS can be

768
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,880
very

769
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:38,480
unstable on the individual uh level so

770
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,200
here I listed two paper that uh talking

771
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,680
about this phenomenon which means like

772
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:49,040
even on the population or cohort uh

773
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,520
level like maybe they have very similar

774
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,119
R squar but the high risk individual

775
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,440
they predict can be bued very

776
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:03,280
differently so we still need to address

777
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,359
this uh uh address this problem if we

778
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,640
want

779
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:12,920
to uh have better or more stable PRS

780
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:17,000
which is more suitable for clinical

781
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,880
usage and uh okay here is the summary of

782
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,880
all the

783
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:28,760
uh uh of of the talk so the last part is

784
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,680
like yes good news is that K have all

785
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:35,680
this potential for predict within the

786
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:39,599
cohort and have many useful application

787
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:43,359
in both basic uh scientific research and

788
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,800
probably very soonish uh clinical usage

789
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,200
but uh however like more works are

790
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,240
definitely needed to improve its

791
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,480
stability and widen is application and I

792
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,960
will thank all my wonderful supervisors

793
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,000
and all my my co-workers and friends

794
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,680
that give me advice and discussing uh

795
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,599
all this problem with me and uh thank

796
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,599
you for listening any questions in the

797
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,559
meantime I was wondering if you have

798
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,800
suggestions for sample sizes or

799
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,839
heritability explain to have a reliable

800
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,640
PRS and if there are dangers or things

801
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,680
to look out for when calculating these

802
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:25,960
in smaller or underpowered

803
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:30,000
GS uh like what is the do mean what is

804
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:32,920
the smallest someh size full crazy yeah

805
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,520
like if if I had a if hypothetically I

806
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,880
studied a rare disease and I don't have

807
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,800
like the heritability explained and the

808
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,920
numbers like a height gwos would have is

809
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,640
there do you feel like there's

810
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,559
recommendations of the heritability

811
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,319
explained or the number of people you

812
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:49,680
would want in your gws to have the PRS

813
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,400
be more

814
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,760
reliable

815
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:59,040
uh that's a good question like

816
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,040
for uh

817
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:09,960
like I I think that depends on like your

818
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:13,760
uh your aim for the of the

819
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:17,319
analysis uh it's like if you want to

820
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:21,800
just show whether the you can if you

821
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:23,880
want to just see the um the whether

822
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:28,040
there's a connection between the PRS and

823
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:30,599
the the the and the the outcome trades

824
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:35,680
it maybe the you

825
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:39,119
can like a a quite small G was made

826
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:43,040
already enough to to show some like a

827
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:50,440
correlation like in this example but if

828
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:54,839
you want to um like um say have a more

829
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:59,720
stable nice results maybe you can you

830
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:02,520
you need larger sample size and uh one

831
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,520
thing actually like the actual number is

832
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:09,520
quite difficult to say because it have

833
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:11,960
to like how the prevalence the gentic

834
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,280
architecture basically like we will say

835
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:19,119
the the more the better and uh another

836
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,640
thing is that if you really have very

837
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:26,040
small sample size of the match the

838
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,839
trades you can use correlated trades to

839
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:32,000
kind of like a

840
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:36,920
uh to in increase the

841
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,839
power like for example in the you our uh

842
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:45,119
DPS mode method when predicting the SD

843
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:50,000
we also use like say uh blood lipid BMI

844
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:53,440
to increase the power so that's some way

845
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,079
you can use to increase the sample size

846
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,839
because basically my answer will be the

847
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,839
more the better

848
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:04,680
hi thank you for a great talk um I'm

849
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,800
wondering this context specific

850
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:11,720
specificity that um like like bogdan's

851
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,079
recent paper shows seems like a really

852
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,319
hard to know how the Field's going to

853
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:17,240
get around that and I'm wondering what

854
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:18,319
your views are for making progress on

855
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,160
that

856
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,040
front um and by that I mean like the you

857
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,440
know the fact that the prediction

858
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,040
accuracy just varies so much by all of

859
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,040
these non- gentic factors

860
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,040
is

861
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,480
um it's like

862
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:42,240
uh

863
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:46,559
So my answer may be not the best answer

864
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,079
but that's how I see it so if of course

865
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,960
like there are going to be the

866
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:54,319
interaction between the GW sorry between

867
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,440
the genetics and the

868
00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:01,240
environmental and I think it's

869
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,680
it's kind of like just sucks as as we

870
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,960
because we want to just use as simple

871
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:10,160
prediction model as possible because

872
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:12,960
like we can see all this like um the PRS

873
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,920
with the performance would very so

874
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,960
differently and within all this cohort

875
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,520
but I think it's kind of inevitable

876
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:26,000
because I think that's how complicated

877
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:30,720
the G G by interaction should be um

878
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,960
maybe like for for my my my current

879
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:38,319
understanding is like maybe we just try

880
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:42,760
to cover the genetic part as good as

881
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:47,760
possible and viewing all this like a um

882
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:50,920
complicity of gy caused the uh problem

883
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,280
as an opportunity to study the gy that's

884
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,960
my current understanding right and then

885
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
does that maybe suggest that as a field

886
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,920
we need to stop thinking so much about

887
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,880
predictive accuracy stop gobbling up the

888
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,880
environmental part of the

889
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:12,559
variance like not exactly I think at

890
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:15,880
least uh my understanding about of the

891
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:23,359
uh instability I think is still caused

892
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:28,000
by the um the DS is underpowered when

893
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:31,599
predicting all this like uh uh

894
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,599
uh snep level uh statistics so and

895
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,280
that's why we that's probably like one

896
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:40,799
of the main reason why we can we see

897
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:44,000
when we're using different uh GS method

898
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:45,760
like the the adjust effect size could be

899
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,280
that difference because that's comes

900
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,839
from the method and also the the low uh

901
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:56,119
Power of sneep level stability so I

902
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:59,160
think maybe the the instability can be

903
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:02,599
partially solved when we have more

904
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:06,280
powerful GS and then

905
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:09,839
like that's can at least we can fix one

906
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:13,280
thing we can like uh have one thing

907
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:17,359
fixed and to see better pattern of how

908
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:20,079
all this Factor interacts that's my

909
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,960
understanding great um also just wanted

910
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:25,920
to say I love the name disco Divas for

911
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,839
your method amazing um we're at time so

912
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,520
thanks everybody again reminder that

913
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,200
next week is meeting free week so

914
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:36,960
there's no meeting and we'll see you in

915
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,960
two weeks stay warm thank you
