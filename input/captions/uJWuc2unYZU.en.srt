1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,280
Uh it is my pleasure to introduce our

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,320
next speaker is Kristoff Reinhardt who

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,039
is a professor in the MIT department of

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,039
architecture. So give a warm welcome for

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,039
Kristoff.

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,320
>> Thank you Jen for having me here. Good

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
morning everybody. Thanks a lot for

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,400
joining us for this day. I just looked

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,560
through the agenda. It's really

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,480
spectacular. you're going to know so

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,360
much about data center. So much more

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,640
than I know about data center. So as Jim

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
said I'm from the department of

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,800
architecture. So hopefully I can give

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,879
you a little bit of insight on data

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,360
center and given the department that I'm

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,079
from uh I going to talk about data

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,079
centers as buildings and uh what the

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,079
opportunities and just the challenges of

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,399
many these build very special buildings

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
are. Maybe just a word about our

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,680
program. We are within the uh

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
architecture department but the program

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,359
is called the building technology

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,359
program. So you can think about it as as

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,159
hybrids between engineers, computer

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,479
scientists and uh and designers. And I

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,600
guess this perspective is what I also

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,840
bring to the presentation here. So uh

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,360
some key takeaways you can pay attention

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
now and then you can leave or fall

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,799
asleep. This is really the main

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
conclusions of what I'm going to talk

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,280
about. Um, a lot of these things, you

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,439
know, you write them down and you think

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
this is so self-evident. Hope they're

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,799
not going to laugh me out of the room,

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,479
but I try to undermine or substantiate

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
what I'm saying here with some extra

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,479
data and give you a sense what that

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,560
means. So, data centers are obviously

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,759
internal load dominated and they are

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,600
constantly cooling and so there's some

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
kind of intuitively every child could

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,680
tell you there's some benefit if you

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,360
have a cold climate in the surroundings.

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
So I going to talk a little more what

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,280
that actually means. So this is

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,960
basically then related to how do you

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
strategically place if you have the

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,280
flexibility your data center and then

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,119
the next point is really that we need a

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
lot of electric load but data centers

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,719
are not the only ones that use

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,439
electricity a lot of changes from heat

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,160
electrification and electric vehicle

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,800
adoption. So how do these topics blend

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,040
into your choices here? And then

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,280
finally, this is also not new, but I

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,599
think it has specific relevance right

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
now. The great opportunities that data

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,760
centers can provide when it comes to

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
thermal district systems. Basically,

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,200
some interesting synergies there. So,

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,599
let's get right into it. Uh, so how does

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,920
a data center compare to different

67
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,080
building types? And if we look at them

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,519
from the outside, it's just a building.

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
There's like the small single family

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
home, there's an office building and

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
there is this windowless monstrosity of

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,319
a data center that we are seeing in the

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
world. So the main difference of course

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,400
between these buildings uh to just give

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,239
you a sense is what happens on the

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
inside. So within the architectural

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
design planning world we're basically

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,080
talking about this equipment loads.

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,920
That's everything except for heating,

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
cooling, conditioning and lighting a

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,959
building. And so when I typically give

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,280
you a sense, a typical family home has

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
about two watts per square meter and the

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,760
net operation is about half of the year

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,440
of this equipment in the building. If we

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
go into an office building, there's a

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
light a large variety, but according to

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,519
the Department of Energy, we have about

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,920
five times more watt per square meter of

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,159
stuff installed, but we're only using it

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,760
a quarter of the year. And then I had to

92
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,480
look at that a couple of times, these

93
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,319
fightful numbers basically. So 10 watt

94
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,280
per square meter for an office building.

95
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,920
You can have a,000 to 4,000 watt per

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,319
square meter with the equipment being

97
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
constantly on in a zeta center which is

98
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,120
pretty mind-blowing. It used to be a

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,280
thousand and now they're basically the

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,799
sky's the limit in this case. So I want

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
to give us more all of a sense what does

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,040
this actually mean. So, uh, for those of

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,599
you who own a barbecue, to give you a

104
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,920
sense, what is the heat coming from an

105
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,400
Nvidia card, like a brand new nice

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,879
server rack that creates about 20,000

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,319
BTUs? Nobody knows what this means, but

108
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,799
then if you compare that, that's

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,799
basically the equivalent heating output

110
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,720
of a burner. So, if you have a nice

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,760
Weber grill in your backyard, that

112
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,799
creates 60,000 BTUs. So, if we now take

113
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,799
this on to the mental image you should

114
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,120
have of a data center, it's like a giant

115
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,560
Home Depot with that is filled to the

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,440
brim with these uh grills that are

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,680
constantly turned on all the time. And

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,919
what you see here is the grills at a

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,320
1000 watt per square meter. If we're now

120
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,400
switching over to the modern data

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,800
center, you don't even have space for

122
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,680
your guests anymore. It's basically it's

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,720
so packed. Every grill has 50 square

124
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,040
feet. That's the amount of heat that is

125
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,759
generated in a data center. It's just

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,919
mind-blowing. And obviously then to say

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
well cooling is an issue is probably not

128
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,479
very surprising. So then how you look at

129
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,639
it if we typically in the architecture

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,199
or design world look at a building like

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
an office building or a single family

132
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,880
home I show you here basically always

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,840
pairs how was it would a building like

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,240
this perform in Minneapolis and Phoenix.

135
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,759
So cold climate, hot climate, and then

136
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
completely intuitive. In the cold

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
climate, you have a lot of red that

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,560
means you have heating energy. And then

139
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,039
if you get into a colder climate, you

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,440
have more cooling energy. Now, if we're

141
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,520
switching the scale, this is how this

142
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,759
looks in a data center. So the other

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,800
buildings disappear. These loads are

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,360
just enormous. And now we are basically

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
seeing the IT load. That's the stuff,

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,240
the equipment. That's why you have a

147
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,880
data center. And then on top of it to

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,639
maintain uh temperatures within the

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,600
buildings cool enough you basically have

150
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,720
a lot of air or liquids that you have to

151
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,680
move and you have to move uh generate

152
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
cooling uh loads me cooling loads as

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
well. And I'm using a dry climate here

154
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
if we I should have actually used a

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,680
thought about it last night also like a

156
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,240
humid climate then you probably can

157
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,919
easily double the blue just because you

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,560
have to get rid of all of this humanity

159
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,880
as well. So a real uh technology battle.

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,080
Now if we want to um evaluate something

161
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
like this and I'm sure this is the

162
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,319
metric people will be tell talking to

163
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,199
you on and on and on. This power use

164
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,440
effectiveness is since data centers are

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,919
in such a different class of buildings

166
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,160
overall. Usually the way we think about

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,160
them is to say okay what's the total

168
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
energy that the building is using and we

169
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,720
are dividing this through the energy

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,319
that is actually being used to run the

171
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,560
IT equipment. So ideally you have a PUI

172
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,360
of one because that means you have the

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,199
perfect uh situation where all the

174
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,199
electricity goes into the goodies while

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,560
you actually have the data center. The

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,720
average right now is about 1.5 globally.

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I should say one thing what a part of

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
probably a lot of my colleagues talked

179
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
about. This just looks at the

180
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
electricity use. This doesn't look at

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,600
the efficiency. How good is the

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,240
equipment that you have in the data

183
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,759
center? That's kind of separately. So we

184
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
are just looking at the electricity use

185
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,479
and the heat that is being generated.

186
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
So uh just to give you a sense then

187
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,400
because Minneapolis and Phoenix that I

188
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,440
the two examples that I showed you on

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,280
the two left and center bar they

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,599
basically would have in this very simple

191
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,400
model 1.59 1.64. So typical POE

192
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,560
efficiency. Now if you are moving

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
actually and you do the obvious thing

194
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,319
you use free cooling you use the air in

195
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,880
Minneapolis which if you've been in the

196
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,360
winter is really cold and you cleverly

197
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,599
move that naturally adabatic cooling

198
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,080
through the building you can basically

199
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,479
kind of half the distance between 1.5

200
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,199
and one. So obviously there's a lot of

201
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,360
potential uh to be had here. Hence the

202
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,280
obser observation being in a cool

203
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,039
climate has a lot of benefits. So then

204
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
there is this interesting relationship

205
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,639
as we are building in different parts of

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,639
the world this data center. How does

207
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,360
this interact with all the other loads

208
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,759
that are going to change? And if you

209
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,919
lived in the northeast, practically

210
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,240
anywhere within the US, there has been a

211
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,080
strong push towards convincing people in

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,400
different parts of the country to adopt

213
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,240
heat pumps. And part of that is concerns

214
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,639
for carbon emission. Other concerns are

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
very simply because it's getting warmer

216
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
everywhere. So people like to have a

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
system that delivers heating and cooling

218
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,400
at the same time. So if you just look at

219
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,120
the bare numbers, heat pumps are being

220
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,280
adopted all over new construction

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,039
existing buildings. If we are now

222
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,479
zooming in a little into Massachusetts,

223
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,880
how something like this could play out

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,560
if we got more data centers, then let's

225
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,560
first look at the economics of the

226
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,399
owner. It's actually economically in

227
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,240
many parts of Massachusetts a bad idea

228
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,000
to put in a heat pump because natural

229
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,320
gas is so cheap. And so there is a

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
strong chance that people unless we do

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,720
dramatic changes to this pricing

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,720
structure in Boston and other way where

233
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
there's a lot of natural gas will not

234
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,440
adopt a heat pump. In other parts when

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,200
you're in western mass where you heat

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
with heating oil that's more expensive

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
you do a little bit of weatherization

238
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,519
because the building stock is not there

239
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,839
very good there we will see a lot of

240
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,040
uptake of heat pumps over the coming

241
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,120
years. Another uh issue is of course the

242
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,519
moment when you introduce a heat pump

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,760
then you introduce the peak of the

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,440
building. So the heat pump will be

245
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
larger than the current air conditioning

246
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,320
system. So in the winter we have this

247
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,480
extra peak. That's super important. The

248
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,040
electric grid will need more electricity

249
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
than it does right now but only for a

250
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,839
few days. And so this is of course where

251
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,000
then the collaboration with the uh data

252
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,200
center can come into place. So what I'm

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,200
showing you here is uh Massachusetts on

254
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
the right hand side. On the left hand

255
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,519
side you see kind of the carbon emission

256
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,000
reductions that are possible in

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,760
different parts of the state if we al

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,880
change to a heat pump, electrify or

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,519
heating. On the left hand side you see

260
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,839
the same thing but taking into account

261
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,320
that an owner will only do that if they

262
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,399
save money. And there basically you see

263
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
it's basically in the middle part

264
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,320
western part of the state. This is where

265
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,959
a lot of changes are going to happen.

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,360
And so if we now start ramping up our

267
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,160
heat pumps, there will be uh upgrades to

268
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,959
the grid necessary. That is probably a

269
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,279
lot of kind of uh thinking going on that

270
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,560
basically ideally the data center sets

271
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,720
at the point where a lot of the

272
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,800
electricity is coming into the state.

273
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,000
And then ideally we managed to get power

274
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,000
purchase agreement ways so that on these

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
five days the critical hours in the year

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,240
when the heat pumps need extra power

277
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
this is basically absorbed and this

278
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,720
means that and I think my colleague uh

279
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,959
Morgan Andre is going to talk about that

280
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,920
from mighty a little a lot more having

281
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,519
very good integration of your heat pumps

282
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,279
with the rest of what's going on.

283
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
There's a lot of dangers and

284
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,000
opportunities.

285
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,320
So we've talked about a heat pump

286
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,640
basically as this thing that uses a lot

287
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,959
of electricity. But I mean the better

288
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,640
way think about it. Electricity comes

289
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:08,160
into into the data center. Out comes a

290
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,519
lot of hot air. And that air is

291
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,000
typically at about 50° C

292
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,279
degree Fahrenheit. So you have basically

293
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,360
this new thing in the world that creates

294
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,440
a lot of low process heat. Now the this

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
is nice if we can use it. The

296
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,120
disadvantage of low process heat you

297
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,160
cannot really move it very long

298
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,720
distances right because uh I mean air

299
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,839
doesn't hold a lot of energy density and

300
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,680
the delta t isn't high enough but what

301
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,160
can we actually do with that? Well

302
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,079
people I mean what I'm telling you is

303
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,720
older than some people in the room maybe

304
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,519
uh because basically we've been doing

305
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,279
this type of work maybe not uh since

306
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,920
2009.

307
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,800
So this uh pedestrian swimming pool here

308
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,880
in Zurich is allegedly the first

309
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,760
application where there was an IBM data

310
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,760
center in 2009. They had the hot air

311
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,839
heat exchanger, warm water under the

312
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,320
street, heat the swimming pool, a lot of

313
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,120
happy Swiss people. So this kind of

314
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,760
synergies work well. A big application

315
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,760
or like a symbolically architecturally

316
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
nice application is to use the hot air

317
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,959
in green houses. This is pretty famous

318
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
the Teles city condor set data center.

319
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,519
These are pretty small data center. This

320
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,399
is located in Paris. The idea here was

321
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,200
to heat an arboritum and create the

322
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,760
conditions of 2050. How the weather in

323
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,560
France is going to be at that point. I

324
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,279
mean it's a nice exhibition. Everybody

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,519
likes bopilic design. So these are very

326
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,320
obvious way of using the heat. Uh it's

327
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,320
maybe not enough to change the world. So

328
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,920
if we want to change the world, let's go

329
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,079
go back home. If we go to the east to

330
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,639
Helsinki, next to Helsinki is a place

331
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,480
called Mansel, Finland. And there's an

332
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,519
interesting case study there to be

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,279
talked about. So typical climate, you

334
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,720
won't be surprised to hear Finland is

335
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,279
cold. Uh in Scandinavia, usually the

336
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,120
buildings are individual midsized

337
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,800
buildings that are all connected through

338
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,639
a district system. So it's pretty

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
uncommon in Scandinavia for people to

340
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,279
own their own boiler or furnace. It's

341
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,839
basically a communal effort. You have a

342
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,399
district system and when this system was

343
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,800
first designed, it was gas fired. And

344
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,720
then come 2014, Yandex, now called

345
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,120
Nibios outside of Russia basically

346
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,440
constructed this data center 50 40

347
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,120
megawatt. And we will talk about it.

348
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,600
It's a clever data center in terms of

349
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,760
the use. It has no mechanical cooling.

350
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,279
It also recovers heat for 2500 homes.

351
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,360
And so right away there was some

352
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,480
efficiencies to be made. Even 10 years

353
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,680
ago, they saved about 11% on the heating

354
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,000
bill of the people uh in the nearby

355
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,440
village. Now if you look at the top left

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,760
side, it's maybe a little hard to see in

357
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,920
that this whole building looks like an

358
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,519
airplane wing. And here you see in

359
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,680
section how that building works. This is

360
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,360
basically one example where the building

361
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,880
faces the predominant wind direction.

362
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,360
the cold air moves to the building and

363
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,360
so it saves a lot on fans on cooling

364
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,839
energy. So these are just clever ways

365
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,040
and even then uh 10 years ago they

366
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,519
managed to get a POE of 1.1. So again

367
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,360
synergies with the cold climate uh just

368
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,160
as a caveat because that's when you read

369
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,480
about the building now you also find out

370
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,040
that when you are investing in these

371
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
type of partnerships that the long-term

372
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,279
viability of both partners is really

373
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,279
important. So in this case basically

374
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,880
when the invasion of Ukraine started the

375
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:40,000
data center uh lost its uh electric

376
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,160
license. So the electric center stopped

377
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,480
no heat to the people and so they had to

378
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,079
use for a couple of months diesel backup

379
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,560
generators. That's just to give you a

380
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,920
sense there are risk obviously

381
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,079
associated with these type of

382
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,839
enterprises.

383
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,839
And then you might say who cares about

384
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
Helsinki? How does this compare to the

385
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,519
US? This is just a very high level

386
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
comparison. Helen Keyi versus

387
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,519
Minneapolis. And I picked Minneapolis

388
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,800
because it's still the continental US.

389
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,639
It's very well connected. Um I'm sad and

390
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,360
happy to report that Minneapolis is

391
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,120
colder than Helsinki. So, uh there are

392
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
opportunities there. At the same time,

393
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,360
since it's continental, it also gets a

394
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,040
little warmer. But the main point is

395
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,120
here. If you want to basically use

396
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,199
climate in the same way as what you saw

397
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,399
in this example, we have climates like

398
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,519
this here in the US as well.

399
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,839
So now I wanted to switch onto something

400
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,600
which I think has a lot of potential and

401
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,040
that's architectural building science

402
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,839
all these things together which is

403
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,920
basically the uh the kind of potential

404
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,079
between data center and thermal district

405
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,839
systems and I thought what I going to do

406
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,480
since right now over the last two years

407
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,560
we had a lot of debates at MIT on our

408
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
campus what to do with our building

409
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,600
similar to a lot of other universities

410
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,920
and portfolio owners have. So this is

411
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,120
like a little crash course on how can

412
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,120
you decarbonize or electrify your campus

413
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
and basically when you look at this is a

414
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,800
section of the campus. What comes in on

415
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,959
the left hand side is natural gas and

416
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,079
electricity. We have like many many of

417
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,279
our peers a central utility plant trigen

418
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,600
system that creates electricity. So we

419
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,079
buy natural gas and make our own

420
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,440
electricity and at the same time we

421
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,399
create chilled water and steam. So steam

422
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,079
has at about 250 to 350 degree

423
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,560
Fahrenheit. So this is really really

424
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,279
hot. Now that's not surprising if you

425
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,199
move steam and then we distribute that

426
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,959
through through loops and then have heat

427
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,639
exchangers in each building and that's

428
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,279
how the buildings are heated. Same for

429
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,079
MGH, same for Harvard. That's a pretty

430
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,320
common uh way of operating. And now all

431
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,000
of these systems have the trouble that

432
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,920
you have old infrastructure buried in

433
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,279
the ground that's at 450 degree

434
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,519
Fahrenheit. So there are a lot of heat

435
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,639
losses. not a great thermodynamic

436
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,240
concept and so basically there's this

437
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
move to fourth and fifth generation

438
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,759
thermal networks and there's a lot of

439
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,920
thinking right now so basically thinking

440
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,480
of midsize data centers that can be part

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,400
of that I think is very interesting so

442
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,720
the fourth generation system on our

443
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,160
campus how would that look like we keep

444
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,400
the chilled water we replace the steam

445
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,000
with a hot water system and so now we

446
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,559
are switching from 350° Fahrenheit to

447
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,439
170° Fahrenheit. So that's a lot better

448
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,679
overall. That requires a good amount of

449
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,440
work because we have to basically change

450
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,120
the heat exchangers. Buildings cannot

451
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
necessarily switch from steam to hot

452
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,200
water. And we probably have to do

453
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,559
finally some upgrades to the single pane

454
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
glass that we have in the main boob and

455
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,440
make our envelopes a little better. Um

456
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,520
and then typically what you will see at

457
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,320
many compasses on the right hand side in

458
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,400
order to store access heat sink heat

459
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,799
source thermal storage we will have a

460
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,840
ball hold field under the MIT football

461
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,559
field which we do have and uh that

462
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,480
basically charges and discharges uh

463
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,440
helps us to seasonally store some

464
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,120
energy. Now if we think about what else

465
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,360
could we be doing we want 80° C hot

466
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,000
water. So can we actually get that from

467
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,320
a data center and of course nowadays we

468
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,200
can do so if I

469
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,000
expand my diagram I have the 50°ree hot

470
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,720
air that's not warm enough for the hot

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,960
water loop but if I then also run an

472
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,760
industrial size heat pump then I can

473
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,520
take this air up this air upgrade it to

474
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,240
80° C and so basically now I have the

475
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,520
hot water that I can feed into my loop.

476
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,480
So what is nice about that is basically

477
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,559
my cup, my central utility plant, if you

478
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,799
look on the left, is not dependent on

479
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,039
natural gas anymore. So it's basically

480
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,640
fully electrified. And what we're doing,

481
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,880
we're feeding some of the electricity

482
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,960
that we're generating in a data center

483
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,880
that creates the hot air back that's uh

484
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,280
basically the source for a heat pump

485
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,039
that very effectively can then operate

486
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,480
the campus. So um again advantage this

487
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,080
is fully electrified future proof as a

488
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
concept.

489
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,240
What would be the holy grail? Well

490
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,320
ideally what a lot of us would like to

491
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,760
do is basically do a fifth generation

492
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,919
thermal network which in new

493
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,919
construction this is and this is a great

494
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,840
opportunity for a data center and if

495
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
you're building a new campus in a cold

496
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,880
climate this I think has a lot of

497
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,960
potential. So effectively what would we

498
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,640
first do when we have a fifth generation

499
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,480
system then we have only one loop that's

500
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,320
called the amient loop and the

501
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,120
temperature is really you can touch it

502
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,520
safely at any time it's from 45°

503
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,919
Fahrenheit to 85° Fahrenheit so it's

504
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,160
this thing of water that circulates in

505
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,799
the ground you can put it in PVC piping

506
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,640
it's very friendly and then basically

507
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,280
what we do we need to have distributed

508
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,559
heat pumps in all the buildings that

509
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,760
deposit and withdraw draw heat from this

510
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,840
loop and uh that is a good amount of

511
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,360
effort doing upgrades to our buildings.

512
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,720
But it basically means that when

513
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,320
buildings heat and cool at the same

514
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,799
time, we take advantage of this right

515
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,919
away. We can again have a ball field to

516
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,000
store some extra energy. Now we are in a

517
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,240
cold climate here, not as bad as some of

518
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,360
the others I showed you, but it is cold.

519
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,840
And so net we need some extra heat. So

520
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,440
the if we had a fifth generation system,

521
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,280
the only heat that we still need

522
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,840
probably will come from either getting

523
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,320
clean steam from somewhere or if we

524
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,600
provide this on campus, we are burning

525
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,760
still natural gas just for the heat. But

526
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,080
there again, I think the real beauty if

527
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,720
you're a physicist and you like just

528
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,720
nice heat flows moving around. If we now

529
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
instead of a cup had a data center, the

530
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,320
data center naturally provides you the

531
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,799
heat that you need to keep the ambient

532
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,520
loop afloat. So basically you

533
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,240
dramatically simplify really the whole

534
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,559
supply system on campus and all you have

535
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,240
is the data center that provides heat

536
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,640
directly that can be used for the

537
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,679
ambient loop to keep it happy and then

538
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,440
you have basically the standard heat

539
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,200
pumps in all the buildings to distribute

540
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:09,679
and work with. So lots of opportunities

541
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,120
here. Uh now the moment of truth. I told

542
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,039
you how great it is to have some heat

543
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,840
pumps locally here. Who would be really

544
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,159
excited to move in a neighborhood with a

545
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,159
data set?

546
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,440
I cannot blame you. I mean, uh, there is

547
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,080
this great website if you want to get

548
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,400
entertained. The top 10 ugliest data

549
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,320
centers in the world. And the top of the

550
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,640
top is the long lines building. Who

551
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,960
wants to be next to a building in

552
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,880
Manhattan where you pay premium and

553
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,360
you're looking at this monstrosity of a

554
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,440
building without any windows? So when

555
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,600
you look at this obviously there has to

556
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,080
be some thought of what are we actually

557
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,400
doing to make this like socially uh

558
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,320
acceptable and there are some different

559
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,080
approaches most of them are smaller most

560
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,919
of them no surprise are in Europe uh so

561
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,799
uh kind of does a data center need to

562
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,280
look like a data center that's a fun not

563
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,480
that small data center in Gladfeldon 20

564
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,440
megawatt and basically what it did is

565
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,840
they put this right next to a hotel and

566
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,760
the local river and so they basically

567
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,600
have fake wood on the outside and they

568
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,520
made it very quiet. These are just kind

569
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,320
of ways to make it more acceptable to

570
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,840
have the systems in place. I like this

571
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
because I like the image hasn't been

572
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,120
built. Will it ever be built? I don't

573
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,080
know. Uh but uh basically the city of uh

574
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,320
Frankfurt uh tries to push now everybody

575
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,120
for all the new data center to have them

576
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,240
aesthetically pleasing. So what does a

577
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,480
green planned facade do to a data

578
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,280
center? I would say absolutely nothing

579
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,240
in given that on the inside we have all

580
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,080
these grills burning. Uh but if you look

581
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,120
at like the the quality of the

582
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,280
neighborhood there are of course uh real

583
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,039
advantages to be make such as do we

584
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,440
control the temperature in the urban

585
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,360
canyon urban heat island effect only if

586
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,320
we reject the heat really effectively

587
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,320
outside and it just helps us to kind of

588
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,080
end with these systems being located

589
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,480
wherever we want them located.

590
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,880
So this takes me to the uh uh key

591
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,480
takeaways. I told you you could have

592
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,400
left uh but uh uh it's basically uh when

593
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
it thinks of locating the building.

594
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,919
There are some real opportunities. I

595
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,000
think don't just buy a standard uh heat

596
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,320
pump without some clever thinking about

597
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,440
how to use uh advantages of nature

598
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,480
around you to reduce uh the energy use

599
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,320
of these buildings. Um also you can't

600
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,679
turn off the cold wind in Minneapolis.

601
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,320
So you have it all the time. So

602
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,400
questions of uh of energy security are

603
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,320
also in your favor. Uh heat

604
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,720
electrification is upon us. It's

605
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
happening everywhere. So I think it's

606
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
really important that heat pump

607
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,919
operators since they will present this

608
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,760
kind of enormous extra load on the grids

609
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,400
everywhere that there are some clever

610
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,840
synergies there and again we are only

611
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,320
talking about peaks heating peaks

612
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,760
electric vehicles I didn't talk about

613
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,760
because I have only a minute and 9

614
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,080
seconds left but this is really these

615
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,360
are kind of opportunities to still

616
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,960
balance this out uh it's mostly about

617
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,720
how do we keep our electricity

618
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,720
affordable in the end. And then I think

619
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,279
for the district thermal systems there

620
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,360
depending on who your clients are and uh

621
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,200
if you are campuses portfolio owners

622
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,600
there are definitely some economically

623
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,640
advantageous kind of things to explore

624
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,600
and with that I thank you

625
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,600
>> questions for Kristoff.

626
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
>> Yes.

627
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,679
>> Hi Tafi Arabi from AMD. A lot of data

628
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,320
centers actually pay for provisional

629
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,720
power, not necessarily power used and

630
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,279
their power usage fluctuate a lot during

631
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,760
the day.

632
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,760
>> Mhm.

633
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,880
>> Have you thought of ways actually you

634
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,200
can also leverage maybe that electricity

635
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,000
when it's not in peak demand or

636
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,640
>> I mean if you if you do that uh then of

637
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,520
course it's like a negative it's nearly

638
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,720
like a battery. So if you uh if you are

639
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,559
in a data center willing to fluctuate

640
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,039
your electricity by the demands of your

641
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,440
local utility, I think the stability

642
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,840
that you can add to the local grid is

643
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,559
enormous. The only real advantages that

644
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,720
I've seen Google made a lot of uh splash

645
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,720
about their data centers, but of course

646
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,200
they are located all over the world and

647
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,440
they're basically moving now when do the

648
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,679
YouTube videos compiled from one data

649
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,120
center to another. that doesn't cost

650
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,159
them anything because I don't think

651
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,720
they're at full capacity. I think uh um

652
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,440
and so these are very clever ways of

653
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,960
doing this if you run your data center

654
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,360
depending I think on who your clients

655
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,559
are probably my colleagues can comment

656
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,799
better on this if you can wait for uh

657
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,880
even if it's just an hour the value

658
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,840
generation is enormous and I think the

659
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,320
the earlier you talk with the local

660
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,320
utilities and do a future demand profile

661
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,919
model the better. So I showed you a

662
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
little bit in Massachusetts. We actually

663
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,279
built an energy model of every building

664
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
in the state. We want to build an energy

665
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,640
model of every building in the world. Uh

666
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,600
so basically this is being used for us

667
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,200
to see what's the current load. If we do

668
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,679
certain changes to the building, how are

669
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,520
the load curves going to evolve and how

670
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,440
likely for different energy policies is

671
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,360
it that they are going to evolve. I

672
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,159
think having a data center in there is

673
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,960
an enormous asset.

674
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,120
>> Thank you.

675
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,120
Thank you.

676
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,919
>> Thank you. Amazing. Uh a way of using

677
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,159
the waste heat uh for district heating.

678
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,559
What's your view on? So people have been

679
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,159
also thinking about using uh waste heat

680
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,559
for u uh data centers to in tandem with

681
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,559
absorption chillers. Uh you know there

682
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,400
are maybe some mixed result in terms of

683
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,240
how you know the grade of heat is and

684
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
how effective that the the cooling

685
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
system would look like. So what's your

686
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,120
what's your view on on that one?

687
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,480
>> It's funny. I looked at that also two

688
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,760
days ago and thought, "Oh, wouldn't that

689
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,000
also be uh great?" I mean, I think the

690
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,000
50 degrees is if you want to have an

691
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,960
entropy wheel and you want to discharge

692
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,679
it, right? Then I think the 50° are not

693
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,080
hot enough. I think they need 80 90. So

694
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,720
it's always the big thing is always do

695
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,279
we have low or high process heat and

696
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,360
unfortunately paints me uh the data

697
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,720
centers have the low process heat. If we

698
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,600
had some uh if we could go 30 degrees C

699
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,600
higher that would be hugely unatious. So

700
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,960
I mean you could do the same hocus pocus

701
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,159
that I showed you before that you

702
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,679
basically combine that with the heat

703
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,240
pump. You upgrade the heat and then use

704
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,960
it for that but it's an extra step.

705
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,279
>> Now the big thing about data centers is

706
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,480
that they're big and so there is one

707
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,480
point of source of heat. So even

708
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
thinking of distributing to go like

709
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,480
upgrading to a higher heat and then

710
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,760
moving at longer distances. I think this

711
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,399
is all on the table. But the the synergy

712
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,600
is not as clear as for the fifth

713
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:07,360
generation network. It needs 50° C.

714
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,520
Voila. Here's 50° C for free. So I think

715
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,799
that's kind of the trade-off here. But

716
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,559
there's a whole field of process

717
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,559
engineers that will can have a field day

718
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,480
with you on figuring that out. Sounds

719
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:21,480
>> good. Thank you. Anyone

720
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,480
else?

721
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,480
Hey,

722
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,640
but

723
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,640
>> the kind person who gave me water.

724
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,200
>> No problem. Uh, you mentioned kind of

725
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,120
wood as a facade, but any comments on

726
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,799
kind of actual construction materials

727
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,200
that maybe are more sustainable. We've

728
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,720
seen kind of wood construction in some

729
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,880
data centers just because also I think

730
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,440
there's a speed to deploy as well as

731
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,240
I'll call them tents, but we have seen

732
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,000
glorified tents be used. um but green

733
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
steel as well. But where do you see kind

734
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
of the most um return on investment in

735
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
focusing on the actual construction of

736
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,120
the of the buildings?

737
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,279
>> No, this is a really uh great question.

738
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,039
I mean the wood cladding is really to

739
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,559
appease the good people of Switzerland

740
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,640
in that neighborhood that it looks like

741
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,320
the forest, right? I think that has more

742
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,720
aesthetic value and this is not even

743
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:13,760
real wood. Okay. Uh but uh so I mean you

744
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,760
said it yourself um like the the

745
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,919
building structure the embodied energy

746
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,240
is relatively small for a data center.

747
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,120
Everywhere else net zero buildings this

748
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,200
is gaining more traction. I mean I think

749
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,000
it's probably a question of structural

750
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,640
integrity. Maybe you can use CLT wood if

751
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,240
you want to. Uh but that depends on

752
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,080
where in the world you are. A lot of

753
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
growth you see in areas where people use

754
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,600
concrete and they're using concrete

755
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,000
because there is concrete right and of

756
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,440
course uh I mean it's just frightful to

757
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,120
me up until a day I thought we are at a

758
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,679
thousand watt and then when I had to

759
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,720
move these grills together I I think it

760
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,919
got really in frightful and I think the

761
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,720
4,000 watt is not the end of the game.

762
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,240
So I mean thinking carefully about the

763
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
structure of your building is probably a

764
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,080
really good idea because you don't want

765
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,279
to have a stranded asset when people say

766
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,880
oh I have 10,000 10k per watch right I

767
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,480
want to be the one known to have the

768
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,840
highest load in the world kind of thing

769
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,200
right

770
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,279
>> thank you

771
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
>> okay we want to give a little bit of

772
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,279
love for our online audience today so

773
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,600
here's a question that came in it starts

774
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,000
off with sir so they're definitely not

775
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:26,799
talking to me uh they want to know why

776
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,679
data centers are typically developed on

777
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:33,200
farmland rather than high-rise

778
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,679
buildings. Uh are there other issues

779
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,240
like due to energy efficiency, cooling

780
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,320
and scalability considerations or there

781
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,240
are there broader resilience and

782
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,480
sustainability factors involved?

783
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,200
>> Uh well short answer I don't know. If I

784
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,600
were to guess most home depots uh are

785
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,279
basically I mean it's a kind of building

786
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,120
uh go big or go home. I think the

787
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,200
economics for a data center that really

788
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,440
helps. So you want large spaces and they

789
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,159
just plus uh I mean on one way

790
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,600
urbanistically there are 20 people in

791
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,840
this big home depot and uh why should

792
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,600
they replace all these people that could

793
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,279
live downtown for all the uh livability

794
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,360
and just uh uh productivity that urban

795
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,840
centers can offer. So I think there are

796
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,240
economic uh reasons and not all of them

797
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,000
are necessarily bad and I think these

798
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,480
data center placement that I'm talking

799
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,720
here about are relatively modestsiz data

800
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,279
centers because again you cannot move

801
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,960
that heat enormous distances. I think

802
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,799
these type of data sensors make really

803
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,320
sense. If you are really finicky and you

804
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,919
want to have this is your data and you

805
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,880
want to keep your data, this is only

806
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,120
you. Then of course you want to have it

807
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,640
with you and then I think then it makes

808
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,559
a lot of sense. Once you made the

809
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,880
decision this is our data center, nobody

810
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,360
plucks in then all of these things

811
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,600
become like good ways to help you with

812
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,760
the economics.

813
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,080
>> Wonderful. Okay. Oh, one more.

814
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
>> So

815
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,279
>> sitting closest to me and I wanted to

816
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,600
cut you off. That's like unbelievable.

817
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,240
>> Yeah, I know. So why do you think that

818
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,440
that that long line long line buildings

819
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,399
the old AT&T building? So So why why and

820
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,039
and I've been inside that building and

821
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,760
so why why Yeah. No, it's it's a

822
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,080
beautiful lobby, by the way. So why why

823
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,519
don't you like the the the the

824
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,279
aesthetics of that building?

825
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,480
>> Oh, wow. Now we are now we're getting

826
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,720
hardcore here. Uh I mean I just try to

827
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,640
project. I'm a big projector and if I

828
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,480
had paid for this apartment right next

829
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,840
to it and everybody says I'm living in

830
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,240
Manhattan and you're looking at that

831
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,559
wall that's less than inspiring. So if

832
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,399
we if I actually go into view research

833
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,159
we know that people like seeing other

834
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,279
people or activity or whatever it's

835
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,480
going on. So this is just a less

836
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,720
attractive view I would overall it also

837
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,320
I would say without having done a survey

838
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,240
it's well I've done a survey with all of

839
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,600
you. Nobody wants to have the data

840
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,640
center right next to them. I think

841
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,559
there's a like an a natural tendency and

842
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,519
then these tricks with the green facads

843
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,679
help us overcome that.

844
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,120
>> Yep.

845
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,000
But maybe there's an apartment just

846
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,840
waiting for you with that.

847
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,159
>> It It could be the engineer versus the

848
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,880
architect kind of thing going.

849
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,679
>> Other data centers are ugly.

850
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,519
I'd rather see that.

851
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,640
It's a race to the bottom. Maybe the

852
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,600
next year is the 2025 uh ugliest data

853
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,840
centers in the world.

854
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,919
>> Okay. All right. One quick question.

855
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,600
>> So, this is about something I just saw

856
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,279
on YouTube yesterday, you know, like

857
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,159
just browsing. Me too.

858
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,159
>> What is the research and what are the

859
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,840
what are the opportunities in noise

860
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,840
reduction? Because as they build these

861
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,320
data centers closest to residential

862
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,039
areas all over the country, people are

863
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,039
starting to be impacted by this humming

864
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,600
that's constantly comes out of this

865
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,279
centers. So what's going on there?

866
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,720
>> It's a good question. I don't know. Uh I

867
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:02,799
mean I try to uh figure that out better.

868
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,200
I mean what I would probably see

869
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,079
generally if you manage same for fume

870
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,440
hoods get the get the noise and the

871
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,240
movement up across the urban boundary

872
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,800
layer that's a good move generally I

873
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,200
would be saying and then this last image

874
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,079
that I showed you is basically a clever

875
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,560
facade system that basically has the

876
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,679
green roofs and openings it's basically

877
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,720
an acoustically active facads actually

878
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:35,040
plants are pretty good at dampening uh

879
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,520
uh noise that comes out of it. I I doubt

880
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,440
you will really overcome it. Probably a

881
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,200
data center, especially if you add more

882
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,240
and more fans and like to it

883
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,720
going to make noise. I think I I can't

884
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,679
give you like a a silver bullet answer

885
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,079
here.

886
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,919
>> Great.

887
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,520
>> Oh yeah, this is like kind of fun to

888
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,599
look at. Not as ugly as the other

889
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,560
building. Our friend here won't agree,

890
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,240
but maybe some of

891
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,240
>> we we have to move on to our next

892
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,440
speaker. Um, sorry. At at at some point

893
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,520
at some point I have to bring down the

894
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,040
hammer on these things. Great. Let's

895
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,040
hear it for Christo. Great job.
