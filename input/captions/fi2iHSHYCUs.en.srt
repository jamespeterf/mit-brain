1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,680
hey everyone pleasure to be here uh my

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,799
name is Evan I'm the CEO and co-founder

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,360
of Helix carbon and we're a climate

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,559
technology company obviously like like

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,360
everyone else here but we're

6
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,920
specifically focused on carbon

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,400
utilization and so you know I I was a

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,520
graduate student here in mechanical

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,439
engineering and business and this

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,680
company is really one that was born kind

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,920
of organically out of a lot of work we

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,160
did here at MIT so know before before

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,119
coming to MIT I worked in climate

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,519
technology and Consulting and but when I

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,719
came here I met David my co-founder who

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,079
who's in the back uh and and Ariel who's

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,120
a professor in the chemical engineering

18
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,760
department here and we really wanted to

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,079
focus on okay what what is the the sort

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,520
of biggest chunk that we can take out of

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,960
out of global carbon emissions and for

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,360
us the the clear answer was Heavy

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,079
industry you know it's it's centralized

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,640
it is high scale it's about a third of

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,680
global emissions and it's an industry

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,320
that is you know facing a lot of

27
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,000
increasing Global pressure because

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,120
there's a lot of regulatory regimes

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,159
whether it's know cap and trade systems

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
outright carbon taxes that are starting

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,920
to affect particularly in the US and

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,240
particularly in Europe the the price and

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,560
and the cost to produce a lot of these

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,640
industries um and there's also sort of a

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,400
carrot as well right there's not just

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,759
these these Global penalties but there's

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,360
also proven green premiums in heavy

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,640
industry whether it's for polymers or

39
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,079
liquid fuels particularly and as well as

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,600
for steel I mean if you look at steel

41
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,560
alone there have been multi-year

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,399
multimegaton off agreements for massive

43
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,240
green premiums for for low carbon steel

44
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,640
and there's also a revenue opportunity

45
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,840
on the tax side right there you know

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,840
there's there's there's tax Equity

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,079
agreements that you can leverage so

48
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,719
basically the bottom line is if you're

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,719
an innovator here there's a huge Revenue

50
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,479
opportunity as as a player in heavy

51
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,159
industry to to lowering your carbon

52
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,680
emissions and what we wanted to do is

53
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,360
really sit at the intersection of this

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
can we take the carbon dioxide that is

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,479
coming off these heavy industrial sites

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,360
and convert it to something that is of

57
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,840
value and for us that looks like an

58
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,160
electrochemical system that we developed

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,440
here at MIT that takes carbon dioxide

60
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,520
from flu gas passes it through our

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,440
system and converts it to a series of

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,800
value added industrial gases and you

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,400
know of course I think there's there's

64
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,879
there's the Energy Efficiency benefit

65
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,080
that we think we have over many others

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,080
in this space there's the fact that our

67
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,680
systems don't rely on on precious metals

68
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,160
and so they're a lot cheaper to build

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,200
but also it's you know and it's not on

70
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,920
this slide but I think the biggest

71
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,879
differentiator we have is we're the

72
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,519
first system that actually has sort of

73
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,280
industrially relevant lifetimes you know

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,840
there's a lot of folks who can achieve

75
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,519
really good carbon utilization for for

76
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,200
tens or even hundreds of hours but I

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,440
think the differentiator our system

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,319
really has against those is we can run

79
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,920
for thousands of hours and and it

80
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,840
finally makes this something that can be

81
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,200
relied on as a source of a lot of these

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,560
industrial gases and so we are taking

83
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,040
this to Market by by partnering with

84
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,120
with existing industrial facilities so

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,280
we take in the the carbon dioxide from

86
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,040
your flu gas convert it on site into one

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,480
of several feed stocks that you may use

88
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,760
carbon monoxide ethylene or methane and

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,680
essentially just give that right back to

90
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,640
you right and this eliminates

91
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,959
Transportation costs it it insulates you

92
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,480
from volatility in in where you're

93
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,280
getting this today so coal and natural

94
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,440
gas particularly natural gas prices have

95
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,120
been extremely expensive and extremely

96
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,720
volatile over the past several years and

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,040
it's also a drop solution you know if

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,599
you're someone who's particularly in the

99
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,040
iron or the polycarbonate or the

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,319
polyurethane industry that uses carbon

101
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,080
monoxide from natural gas today this

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,840
requires no operational disruption

103
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,120
against your current

104
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,080
systems and so we're building this by

105
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,680
first going to a 10 kilowatt pilot that

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,640
we're building today actually here in

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,159
Massachusetts at a py at a biomass

108
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,079
pyrolysis facility and we're scaling up

109
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,560
so we're looking for for partners to go

110
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,000
to that next step we're building 100

111
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,480
kilowatt system slated for 202 six and a

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,360
getting to the megawatt scale in 2028 so

113
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,200
you know if this is something that that

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,239
resonates with you and your companies

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,439
and it's something that you would be

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,879
interested in piloting with we're

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,360
continuing to look for partners in that

118
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,199
sort of two to 200 kilogram to two to

119
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,440
two ton per day scale as well as you

120
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,759
know this is broadly speaking a pretty

121
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,880
generalizable electrocatalysis platform

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
at the end of the day what we do is is

123
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,919
not just carbon conversion but but

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,199
chemical conversion and electrical

125
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,039
chemical conversion and so if there is a

126
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,400
specific process that you're looking at

127
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,639
that you want to Electrify or you want

128
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,880
to Electrify more efficiently um we're

129
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,759
also more than happy to to work with you

130
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,199
on customizing this this platform to

131
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
your needs so with that thank you for

132
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,000
your time and uh we'll talk to you at

133
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,389
our at our booth after

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,389
[Applause]
