1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,920
Okay, thank you. Uh thank you again for

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,880
doing the work, the reflection and and

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:25,680
trying to engage your mind and and hand

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,760
in this activity. Um next coming up is

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,400
the propeller case study. our first

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,559
session. Erdin is going to moderate it

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,040
with uh the actual CEO of Propella, John

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
Conson. And what we'll do for this,

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,960
we're going to have a very interactive

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,280
no slides workshop. Um you have all

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
received the uh the case brief

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
description of the case study. Hope you

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,879
had a chance to look at it. Um and we'll

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,600
just set it up in a second.

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,000
That's great. Thank you very much.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Can we proceed with the with the case

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,960
study? Yeah. Okay. Great. John, thank

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,119
you so much for being here. Uh you may

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,880
not know this, but the students here

20
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,799
know you already through the case study.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,720
So here is why we're doing it. Let me

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,760
just make a few remain. John, uh you can

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,960
uh make yourself Yeah, please. Um all

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,960
right, folks. So here here's the deal.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,400
Entrepreneurship is neither science nor

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,479
art. It is a craft. And in a craft,

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
learning from mentors, learning from

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,159
leaders is essential. This is why we are

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
doing this is why we are doing case

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,360
studies. They're going to be very

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
interactive. The goal is for you to

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,240
express what you think, to argue and

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,759
debate. Uh expect cold calls. So, we do

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,759
expect you to have read the case studies

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,520
before the case presentation. So, be

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,200
ready. And the reason we're beginning

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
with this case study is this. Let's

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,439
let's make no mistake about it. the the

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,840
the

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,759
field of addiction doesn't provide a lot

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,119
of hope for us at the moment and I think

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,280
that's just the reality of it. Uh we we

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,759
cannot yet say that that there are

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,680
solutions that are going to be uh

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,439
certainly be able to address those

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,560
problems. We're in a state of this

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,520
perhaps hopeless stasis and and that's

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,400
and that's what it is. And so as we were

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,480
designing the program together,

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
one of the things that we were asking is

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
what can we do to give people hope?

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
Because entrepreneurship and innovation

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,120
begins with hope. And when we learned

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,200
about Propeller and what John and his

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,560
team are doing, we just said, "Oh my

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,360
god, this is this is the way. What a

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
great case to really bring to life this

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,599
the importance of hope." Um that's

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,519
number one. And number two, really there

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,959
is a lot to learn from this case study

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
about how technologies get

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,000
commercialized, how leaders steward

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,040
those technologies. So let's thank you.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,080
Thank you very much.

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,599
Um let let's begin Marco. May I please

66
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,760
summarize have ask you to summarize part

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,599
A of the case where the background of

68
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,599
John is described in the healthcare

69
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,159
field.

70
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,080
Have you have you read the case?

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,440
Okay, that's that's fine. Who who has

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,959
read the case? Raise your hand. Yeah,

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,840
Sarah, please. Will you will you

74
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,120
summarize uh John John's background? How

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,120
he came into the healthcare field

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,599
yesterday. So I look you see the best I

77
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:36,799
can. Uh John is someone who has uh

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,879
really started corporate America. Um so

79
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,560
large organizations

80
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,799
where um mobile just it is 3M um

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,280
essentially lot going on that company so

82
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,400
computer products sticky notes uh but

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,720
also has uh quite the the healthcare uh

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,120
arm as well. Um and so looks like how

85
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,319
did this gain the track recorders

86
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,319
through that through that preparation to

87
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,200
really focus in healthcare uh which is

88
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,319
where he he started career

89
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,439
and Billy started subping in solely on

90
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:19,799
on healthcare uh and developments on it

91
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,799
the part um

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
that's fair That's that that that that's

93
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,520
all fair. And so the goal is going to be

94
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,919
we we're going to go through a a set of

95
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,840
questions to set up the case and then

96
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,199
John will offer his reflections on your

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,960
comments. That's going to be key and

98
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,960
then we'll have a Q&A with everyone in

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,840
the group. Now so as you can see John is

100
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,040
coming into this field into a startup

101
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,680
that eventually became Propeller from a

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,520
corporate background. Now Mark, if I

103
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,199
could go to you for a second, you are

104
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,960
going into the field of SUD

105
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,600
entrepreneurship from the academic

106
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
field, right? You you are a faculty

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,040
member, a Rockefeller, you're spinning

108
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,800
out your company. How do you think your

109
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,000
pathways well your pathways are

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,880
different from Johnson even though you

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,880
are in a sense ending up in a similar

112
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,160
destination, but how do you think how

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,759
you think, what the skills you have, how

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
you think about the world, how is it

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
different from John's? I think they

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
probably

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,280
actually here here's a

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,600
I think they are probably 100%

119
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,720
different. Um I'm sort of coming from

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,919
the molecular mechanism aspects of it.

121
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,680
Uh not so much from from any uh any

122
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,759
business uh development side

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,919
and I feel like I understand the basics

124
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,880
of what needs to be done but not

125
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,880
probably how to do it.

126
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,800
And I hope I will make progress on that

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,960
quickly.

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Okay. And so how do you how do you think

129
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,600
about it in your company right now? What

130
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
skills do you acquire about bringing

131
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,000
additional team members? What skills do

132
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
you need to nurture in yourself as the

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,680
entrepreneur leading event? And that's

134
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,680
an important question for all of you.

135
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
You're partly you are to meet others so

136
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,759
you can identify additional skill sets.

137
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,800
You're also to bro yourself. How do you

138
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
think about it?

139
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,080
Well, I definitely need uh everyone that

140
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,000
is uh focusing on on different aspects

141
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
than than just the research itself.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,479
Basically, I will need advisor. I will

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,960
need uh probably at some point a CEO

144
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,720
that has experience in in the field

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
ideally in the field of healthcare and

146
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
then maybe even more in the field of SUD

147
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,880
if possible.

148
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,720
Why why would you like a CEO instead of

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
you being the CEO yourself?

150
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,880
Well, because that's that's not what I

151
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,039
will do best. Uh maybe I can try it but

152
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,160
I don't think it would be efficient for

153
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:53,000
the company to be fast to be to be yeah

154
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,000
to be moving as quickly as possible.

155
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Okay.

156
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,400
Now um who would like Thank you. Uh who

157
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,000
would like to summarize uh part B of the

158
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,000
case where the technology is described?

159
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
please.

160
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
Yeah.

161
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,560
Um my name is Tomokco. Nice to meet you.

162
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:28,319
So um the B is about the the scientist

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,240
discovering um

164
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,360
an obs made an obser observation which

165
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,960
came to an idea where it could um

166
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,960
channel into the sorry I'll take my

167
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,960
notes

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,440
into the baby suffering from

169
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:53,440
irregulatory breathing and

170
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,800
um is Dr. P Da he did say it right

171
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,199
Dr.

172
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,639
He really narrowed into the interest

173
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,319
that he discovered and um he found a

174
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,319
niche which was the opioid exposed

175
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,280
babies and um

176
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,000
yeah and there was obviously a need uh

177
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,879
unmet medical need in in the research

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,440
that he he has continued and he

179
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:22,000
developed actually a medical device that

180
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,000
can um that have seemed to give result

181
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
in the

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,160
experiment. It's it says experimental.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
So, I'm guessing it was some kind of uh

184
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,759
clinical trial or something that they

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
did. They actually seen a positive

186
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
effect on the medical device that he

187
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:40,080
made and then he made the connection

188
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,599
with um John who has then yeah wanted to

189
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,800
make this into the market.

190
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,800
Great. Let me push this a little

191
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,600
further. What does the UI

192
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,200
Oh yeah. I also

193
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
wanted to highlight was I done this

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,080
really interesting a lot of medical and

195
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,560
scientific advances. Um the point about

196
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,080
serendipity and observations with this

197
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,560
great uh which really actually gave

198
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,600
science into

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,000
the health applications um to like

200
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,279
um you know like other famous examples

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,880
are you know aloning pencil like an

202
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,760
observation of something like really

203
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,560
crystallizing everything.

204
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,680
That's a great point. Now let me push

205
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,680
again on the technology promoting

206
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,480
in in this book is in general does

207
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
technology as

208
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
okay

209
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,600
so first we need to describe it in ways

210
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,399
that are simple understandable also

211
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,920
comprehensive. So what does a technology

212
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,920
do?

213
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,920
So

214
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,839
it

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,399
Uh so whoa. Uh so basically uh sto

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,120
stoastic resonance

218
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,440
um and the idea of using that as a

219
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,440
signal amplifier.

220
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Um

221
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,680
yeah. So, so leveraging that uh

222
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:17,839
technology uh in combination with uh

223
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:20,160
some of the discoveries in uh biology

224
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,600
uh in relation to the squid and and what

225
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,399
was observed in in in

226
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,720
um a completely different uh uh area of

227
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,760
expertise and kind of uh connecting

228
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,640
those dots together in order to uh

229
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,640
leverage that in a in a way that can be

230
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,399
used to

231
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,279
uh help

232
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,279
uh treat substance use

233
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,399
uh sufferers. Yeah.

234
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,959
Okay. Good start. Now, let's let's do

235
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,600
this again. Hey, uh if I'm if I'm

236
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,720
pushing this is purely with the goal of

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,920
land, there's nothing else going on.

238
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,920
This is this is a goal, right? But put

239
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,120
yourself in the in the shoes of Dr. pay

240
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,440
the P right you've identified this

241
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,800
interesting Panamani you're fascinated

242
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,720
by it you've also been working on it for

243
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,959
a number of years you've been working 15

244
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,279
years so there is something near you

245
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:23,120
that be care that it goes somewhere and

246
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,480
it is important for you that someone

247
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,240
like John gets interest

248
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,440
you need to find a way to kind of date

249
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,200
in a way John is not a scientist he's

250
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,959
been around technology but we're not a

251
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
scientist We need to explain it to him

252
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,880
in a way that can dispense and more

253
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,279
importantly he feels compelled by right

254
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,200
so let's lend describe this to to John

255
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
and what John is going to do he will

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,560
tell you how Dr. Pedapha presented in

257
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,560
the game because there is a reason he

258
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,560
got interested right and one of those

259
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
reasons is Dr. the beta for and how he

260
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,640
described it. So, let's let's Oh, do you

261
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,560
need the mic? Yes. What? No. Yes. Yes. I

262
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,800
I will be using it. I'm sorry. Yeah. No.

263
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,480
So, you go and and then let's go with

264
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,839
you again. Yep. And

265
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,839
sorry about that. Yeah.

266
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,240
Wait. We do actually.

267
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah. Oh, there. Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,959
So let let's let's do it. Let's describe

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,600
it the technology in a way that raises

270
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,279
the interest

271
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
and is understood.

272
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,399
So this technology it there is um the

273
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,760
signals are very weak and usually it's

274
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,880
too weak for normal uh devices to pick

275
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,800
up. So it's impossible to measure these.

276
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,519
But by utilizing this particular

277
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,240
technology, you can amplify it as Corey

278
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,720
said and put it in a form where it's

279
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,880
very easily detectable.

280
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,880
Um, and that's powerful because you're

281
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,240
putting from impossible into something

282
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,880
that's real. Um, realistic.

283
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,800
Um, boom. Right. Everyone observe. She's

284
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,680
saying

285
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,639
that was impossible before. With this

286
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,760
innovation, it is.

287
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,560
All of a sudden, John is interested,

288
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,160
right? What he needs to know now is that

289
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,760
that impossible thing is also valuable,

290
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,959
right? Do you want to give that a shot?

291
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,800
Right? So, not all possible things are

292
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,040
valuable.

293
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,360
Why don't you give it a go? Yeah.

294
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,360
That was good. Impossible is not

295
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,360
possible.

296
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,560
Okay. Um

297
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,560
uh let's see. Uh

298
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,760
can can you reframe that one more time,

299
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,519
please?

300
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,120
Right. So what Tomoka said, she said,

301
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,160
"Hey,

302
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,199
uh signal amplification of the sky was

303
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,959
impossible before this technology."

304
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,079
And if I'm speaking loudly, it still

305
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,680
doesn't help, right? Because

306
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,680
No, dude. I need the mic. Could could I

307
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,560
use the mic just for uh for media

308
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,560
purpose? So right what what Toma is

309
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
saying hey there is this interesting

310
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,760
technology that we've been working on

311
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,839
for a long time and by the way this is

312
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,160
not just in our field this is now a

313
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,120
general phenomenon that physicists are

314
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,199
aware of that biologists are aware of so

315
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,639
it's real and signal amplification of

316
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,560
this kind was impossible before it is

317
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,079
possible now so John is interested huh

318
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,800
something that was impossible is

319
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,160
possible now but he needs to know that

320
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,399
this is valuable as well that there is

321
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,880
value in signal amplification. What do

322
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,880
you say to him?

323
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,959
So there's there's uh this idea of of

324
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880
stoastic resonance has has been around

325
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,000
um for a really long time. It's it's a

326
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,959
proven technology and it's a it's a it's

327
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,440
a proven way of of amplifying signals

328
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:14,399
that are otherwise undistinguishable

329
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,000
like um and the noise and uh this is

330
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,120
something we can apply to to many

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,800
different problems and uh can capitalize

332
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,399
on on some further investment.

333
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,519
Okay.

334
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,000
Uh do you want to give that a go?

335
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,160
Hi Jeff. There you go.

336
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,639
Yes. So my name is Gifty and I just

337
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,880
wanted to add on that at least in the

338
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,160
case study it mentioned that you know

339
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,720
current um technology so with the

340
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,360
stoastic resonance it was used to like

341
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,160
help with motor functions. So that was

342
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,480
one evidence of why that technology may

343
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,800
work. Um, and then as you referred to

344
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,240
earlier, I forgot the name, but um, it

345
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,720
did mention how um, was it Corey?

346
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,680
Cory.

347
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,000
Cory, yes. With the vibrating insoles.

348
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,800
So, that's all examples as well as the

349
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,720
squid um, you know, reference that was

350
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,360
made. So, that's all evidence that, you

351
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,759
know, there's somewhere, you know, you

352
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,920
can go somewhere with this technology.

353
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,639
Yeah. All right. Uh, so now Melanie,

354
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,680
let's go to you. Thank you. Uh so

355
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:24,720
Melanie you're now John and

356
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,680
you're speaking with Dr. Peter you

357
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,000
you've heard about this tech

358
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,720
you want to ask questions what questions

359
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,120
do you ask Dr. paid for because right

360
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,360
your mindset is not purely scientific.

361
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
You're wondering hey can this become

362
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,279
something commercial.

363
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,279
What are the questions that you ask?

364
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,399
Um sure good morning uh my name is

365
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,600
Melanie Jimmerson. Um I think in a

366
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,279
response to a question I'd asked would

367
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,639
first start with the mindset and the

368
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,920
mindset is that progress is not linear

369
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,839
but it's more of a momentum or continuum

370
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,120
of everything that we're continuing to

371
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:10,480
work on. Um and so I would ask next is

372
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,319
for this viable idea how could we

373
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,839
continue the continuum of the

374
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,480
progression of the technology that we

375
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:21,520
have and in what scales? Yeah. So um how

376
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,400
will the technology develop? Right.

377
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,400
How will the tech develop?

378
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,000
Other questions?

379
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,480
How will the tech develop?

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,640
Hi, I'm Dr. Ray Denny. It's nice to meet

381
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,600
everyone here. Other questions I would

382
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,120
ask, how reliable is this technology? If

383
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,240
we're going to be administering it to

384
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,280
premature babies, it has to be reliable.

385
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,200
Also, it has to be reproducible.

386
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,600
uh define reliable. Reliable in what

387
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,080
sense?

388
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,039
Reliability when it's detecting the

389
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,880
signals, how likely is it to detect the

390
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,919
correct signal

391
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,400
and how basically how safe is it? Right?

392
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:05,400
Is it reliable? Is it safe?

393
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Okay.

394
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Okay.

395
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,360
Um how can it actually be deployed?

396
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,720
What do you mean? So

397
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,559
what do

398
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,480
manufactured? What is it going to look

399
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,200
like that's usable? So even if

400
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,320
that's your job

401
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
doesn't know the answer to those.

402
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,600
Oh okay. Okay. So he wouldn't be asking

403
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,760
the question

404
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,679
because if if you as a business person

405
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
go to a science person and say hey how

406
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,200
will you take it to market?

407
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
That's you're not proving a value.

408
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,320
So I'm asking I'm not asking how you

409
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,559
take it to market. I'm asking what is

410
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,400
the vehicle for this technology to be

411
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,280
actually introduced into the real world.

412
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,640
So like it's so the technology is there

413
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,559
but the the they put it into a bassinet,

414
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
right? So I think the question would be

415
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,360
but I mean I'm assuming that this came

416
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,000
to John before the bassinet was fully

417
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,039
developed.

418
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,080
How do you productize it?

419
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,240
How do you productize it? Yeah.

420
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:10,520
How can the technology be okay? I got

421
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,520
you. That that's fair. How would that

422
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,840
be deployed?

423
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,080
I thank you.

424
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,080
B says

425
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,240
yeah. Uh

426
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,000
well you have this in front.

427
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,760
Um one of my question is how is it

428
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,919
differentiated in particular? You have

429
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,440
vibrating solutions, random noise

430
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,080
generators that are available in a

431
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,640
consumer goods space that have no

432
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,240
regulation associated for them. So what

433
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,240
are the discoveries that have been made

434
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,720
that could differentiate this and apply

435
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,120
this through to warrant the additional

436
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,679
cost and overhead required to make this

437
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
into a medical device technology. And

438
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,880
then this leads directly into the

439
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,080
question about intellectual property.

440
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,360
What about this resonance or particular

441
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,360
form of resonance is going to be

442
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
optimizable or going to be patentable

443
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,160
such that it's not obvious to anybody

444
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,720
who's been developing bathing suits that

445
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,720
were already in the market at that time

446
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,559
such that there is a moat formed through

447
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,160
intellectual property.

448
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600
Okay. Right. So now you're introducing

449
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,720
IP and what we need to start thinking

450
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,160
about all of us is John is already

451
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
thinking when he is hearing all that

452
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,640
he's thinking who do we need on the

453
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,160
team? We need IP who the right crack the

454
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,400
folks to go that for that

455
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,240
we need manufacturing right so we need

456
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
to start thinking about team composition

457
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,320
okay Dr. seems coming to you. Thanks

458
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Mark.

459
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,799
Perfect. He already said my two points

460
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,679
really which were

461
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,799
from a regulatory perspective. What are

462
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,640
the predicate devices that you would be

463
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:56,080
referencing in filing a 510K

464
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,240
so that the FDA can understand hazards

465
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,080
and efficacy are the only two things the

466
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,640
government I mean are the core

467
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,200
foundational issues and then on the

468
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,320
intellectual property landscape um it's

469
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,520
just vital to spend dozens or hundreds

470
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,080
of hours searching the entire IP

471
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,400
landscape that could be relevant to this

472
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,880
because uh you know the business model

473
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,640
has to hinge on

474
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,760
uh not just excellence but protection.

475
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,520
Yeah. Uh and could I actually put you

476
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,120
very quickly on the spot? You've been in

477
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,280
the shoes of talking about your

478
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,840
innovations at MSG to potential

479
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,360
licensers of that technology. How do you

480
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,840
how did you present those innovations,

481
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,520
sir? What what high level advice do you

482
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,320
have for the folks here as to what's

483
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,000
important? Um

484
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:50,400
that's that's too big a question. um

485
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,640
because it depends I guess on whether

486
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,559
you're starting from the health care

487
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:00,080
organization and let's say a consortium

488
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:04,000
of neonatal intensive care units who

489
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:08,159
meet regularly and identify unlongfelt

490
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,120
needs and they could be the pulling

491
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,240
function to bring the technology into

492
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,039
existence as opposed to the technology

493
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,840
ology push which is from the research

494
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,520
labs and companies with a cool new thing

495
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,640
and we always said at MGH that the magic

496
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:31,200
space the serendipitous space is how you

497
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,840
match up tech push with clinical pull

498
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,559
and so that's the highle way that I

499
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,200
would think about it as opposed to just

500
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:43,679
how you would present it I mean that's

501
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,000
more like hey is there a particular

502
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,039
neo neonatal intensive care unit that's

503
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,799
very very interested in

504
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:57,440
in certain issues with premature infants

505
00:22:52,799 --> 00:23:01,440
and has all is eager to be the first

506
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,559
pilot site for a clinical trial once we

507
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,320
figure out whether this is a 510K

508
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,840
application because there's strong

509
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,520
predicates or whether it's a PMA or an

510
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,760
IDN

511
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,760
which our friends can explain all of

512
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,320
those pathways are very complex and of

513
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,559
course I'm sorry to keep babbling but

514
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,039
there's the um

515
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,000
the uh the institutional review

516
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,039
committees for

517
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,159
the trials uh for human studies which

518
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,799
this would be the first um if one was

519
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,600
doing a study of the device in a

520
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,679
clinical setting then you've got to have

521
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,799
institutional review board approval and

522
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,520
the IRB is going to say, "Hey, is this

523
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,080
uh FDA approved or not? If not, then

524
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,799
show me that you've done your homework

525
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,799
as far as uh the pathway." So, it gets

526
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,799
complex

527
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,240
and and then to you, Leonardo.

528
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,520
I was just going to say some additional

529
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,039
questions that haven't really been

530
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,400
touched upon. Um, how much does it cost?

531
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:11,039
What's the market size? Um, are there

532
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,159
already patents in place? And who else

533
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,159
is on board?

534
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,120
I uh Adams

535
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,880
is

536
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,880
on board.

537
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,240
Okay, let's uh go last to Leonardo and

538
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,159
then John had you come take center stage

539
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,400
offer reflections on on the

540
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,200
perspectives. So please

541
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,039
very briefly um one question and then

542
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,200
John I'm sure will uh comment why why we

543
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,919
care about the technology is there a

544
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,919
problem to solve and we will also

545
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,480
discuss and John will present there is

546
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,400
actually no predicate so we have to be a

547
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,640
pioneer in creating everything creating

548
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,679
regulation and negotiating with FDA and

549
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,640
that's really suffering so but why we

550
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
care about that and then I'll pass it to

551
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,400
John

552
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,919
yeah John uh

553
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,279
please join us if you here. So I want to

554
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,039
make sure there's uh there is a great

555
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,559
deal of time to interact with you saying

556
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,880
welcome by the way. Thank you so much

557
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,880
for for

558
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,039
um

559
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,000
Dr. Cy you're raising your hand. Just

560
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:32,480
one other loose topic is the management

561
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,400
of conflict of interest to the extent

562
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:40,960
that it's invented somewhere by somebody

563
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,760
and you need that person the inventor in

564
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,039
the new in the startup in order to

565
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,919
provide domain expertise in which case

566
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,679
the management of conflict of interest.

567
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,960
If the inventor is a employee of a

568
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,919
provider organization like Rockill or

569
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Mass General, then that's a whole space

570
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,120
that has to have a lot of uh attention

571
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,880
pay to it.

572
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,880
Would would you have a comment for that?

573
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,559
Yes.

574
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,240
And several more. Um so I don't want to

575
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,840
start with that. I'd like to start more

576
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
at the beginning and then jump into this

577
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,400
and we'll come back. Is that all right?

578
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,480
So yeah in that case let's let me ask

579
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,480
you John would you offer

580
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
some perspectives on the journey that

581
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
are not in not in the case study it

582
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,440
perhaps offer more to the students.

583
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,440
Sure. Sure. And in fact I was uh taking

584
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
some notes so let me reflect on those.

585
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,640
Um

586
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,600
what came up in early was uh hey what

587
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,559
kind of abilities do you need to really

588
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,520
get a venture going right and abilities

589
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,080
are very important right we hear about

590
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,840
knowledge skills and abilities all

591
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,520
throughout our lives you need to develop

592
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,480
knowledge you need to develop skills and

593
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:04,080
you need to have abilities and I think

594
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,760
synonymous with skills are traits right

595
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,440
and

596
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
starting a venture

597
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,919
whether it's focused on substance use

598
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,600
disorder or something else requires I

599
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,520
believe

600
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,240
first and foremost a trait of

601
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,919
resilience.

602
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,520
Resilience because nothing goes the way

603
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:31,200
you expect it to go.

604
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,520
There will be setbacks along the way.

605
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,880
Things that you think are slam dunk are

606
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,159
not. You will be surprised

607
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,840
and it's your ability to take a step

608
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,039
back,

609
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,480
learn from that setback and then set a

610
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,760
new more powerful course to succeed. So

611
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,440
resilience is absolutely key to the

612
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:59,440
success of your venture in this space

613
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,080
and any other startup space. Got it?

614
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,520
Startup. Another trait I'd like to

615
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,840
reflect on is actually

616
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,919
reflected and written about long ago in

617
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,559
a book by a gentleman named Jim Collins

618
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,000
called Good to Great, who did extensive

619
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,480
research on what made companies really

620
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,279
successful over a sustained period of

621
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,679
time.

622
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,520
He concluded among many things that

623
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:32,080
leadership at the top of a company needs

624
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,520
to be humble but driven.

625
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
And I think we've seen countless

626
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,320
examples especially the last few years

627
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,880
where you can say to yourself, "This

628
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,480
person is really driven

629
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,960
but maybe not so humble,

630
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,760
right? This person's really brilliant

631
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,559
and they know it, but perhaps not so

632
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,000
humble. And while they may have great

633
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,960
success, it's the companies that endure

634
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,120
that are most important to us. The

635
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,080
companies that

636
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,640
provide innovation after innovation that

637
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,399
return great stockholder wealth, but

638
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,799
also improve human lives. and the CEOs

639
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,320
and the CEOs in lineage of those

640
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,279
companies

641
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,600
if they're humble and driven typically

642
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,159
provide and deliver on those kinds of

643
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,720
promises. Right? So traits resilience,

644
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,039
humble but driven.

645
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,200
Okay. Uh thanks for letting me get that

646
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,200
one out.

647
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,360
It's all about technology meeting needs.

648
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,080
So we're going to talk about payar for a

649
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,200
second. Right. So he's down at Woods

650
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,679
Hole and he discovers that every time

651
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,000
the table shakes, the squid that he's

652
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,960
doing an experiment on, the axon fires.

653
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,480
And he wonders why why does this axon

654
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,240
fire every time the table shakes? And

655
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,520
the table shakes because it's trying to

656
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,399
maintain a saline temperature bath at a

657
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,360
constant level. And to do that, it stirs

658
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,279
the saline. That saline uh tub is next

659
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,919
to the table. And when it stirs, it

660
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,919
makes the table shake. but just ever so

661
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,440
slightly. And at first, Dr. Pedapar

662
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,120
didn't even realize that the table was

663
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,039
shaking.

664
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,480
So, he couldn't figure it out why. So,

665
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,000
this is an important trait, too.

666
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,480
Collaboration.

667
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,840
What did he do? He didn't sit back and

668
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,919
just say, "Whoa, what could it be?"

669
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,520
He went to go see another Collins,

670
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,600
believe it or not. Only this one happens

671
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,399
to be at MIT.

672
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,240
And he says, "I noticed whenever this

673
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,039
table shakes, this axe on fires. What

674
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,840
the heck is it?" And Jim Collins,

675
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,159
another one says to him, "Oh, it's

676
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,760
stochastic resonance."

677
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,720
And at this time, maybe stochastic

678
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,640
resonance is around 10 years old as a

679
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,120
field of science. It just celebrated its

680
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,240
40th year anniversary in 2021, by the

681
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,000
way. So, it's a 42y old known technology

682
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,840
now.

683
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,399
And Pafar says, "What the heck's that?"

684
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,240
And Pafar is no dummy, right? physics,

685
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,559
undergrad, MD, Duke, UNCC,

686
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,640
had Harvard, right? Practicing

687
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
physician, now chair of neurology at the

688
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,799
Dell Medical School. So, he's pretty

689
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,960
bright guy, but he's humble enough to

690
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,919
listen to what Dr. Collins has to say

691
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,760
and he dives in and he starts his

692
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:27,279
journey of, well, I want to have this

693
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,880
apply to helping babies breathe. Now,

694
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,200
where did he come up from with that

695
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,600
idea? Well, it just so happens back in

696
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,960
the 70s, there were a couple guys at

697
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,720
McGill University who wrote some papers

698
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,039
on mathematical modeling of human

699
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,000
respiration

700
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,240
and Dr. Pedafar through his experience

701
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,640
in looking at babies in the NICU knew

702
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,519
that there were breathing problems

703
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,360
and so he thought, well, if I can make

704
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,039
this work to help babies breathe, that

705
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,000
could be really something. So he did

706
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,039
further computational modeling

707
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,919
and then developed the very first device

708
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,840
and back in 197475

709
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,799
published his first paper with one

710
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,640
neonate that said hey guess what this

711
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:17,039
stochastic stimulation seems to work now

712
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,559
he didn't have it all sorted out he

713
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,200
didn't know what the amplitude he didn't

714
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,559
know what frequency but again he was

715
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,880
humble he was driven that led him to

716
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,600
work at Harvard

717
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,000
and the V institute where they developed

718
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,080
better prototypes.

719
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,159
They did first investigational device

720
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,320
studies on humans. They expanded the

721
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,320
number of babies that they were looking

722
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,159
at and went from that one and they did

723
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,880
in 2009 a study with 10 preterm infants

724
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,120
and showed, yep, we're actually seeing

725
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,720
improvement in breathing control in

726
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,880
preterm newborns. Fantastic.

727
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,679
All right, so stop there. That's a big

728
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,960
important story about I think Dr. Pafar

729
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,679
does it help and I'm coming back here we

730
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,640
good any follow- on question about early

731
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,080
innovation

732
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,760
so now we'll go so this is the

733
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,919
innovation this is the technology now

734
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,120
there's the next phase right which is

735
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,440
okay from technology to I'll call MVP

736
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,880
minimum viable product and now and and

737
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,039
Dr. pafar turdan's you know explanation

738
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,640
upfront isn't a business person he's not

739
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,880
literally thinking about well what is

740
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,080
the product

741
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,720
right I I I know I've got a concept here

742
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,480
of this pad that baby can lay down on to

743
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,799
improve breathing but what what really

744
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,880
is the product so that's really the

745
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,679
second phase of this development right

746
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,159
and serendipity with the squid love the

747
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,880
word serendipity for me right I just

748
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,120
left running a company for four years

749
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,840
out on the west west coast that happened

750
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,440
to be my was my first experience in

751
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,799
electro stem right for pain management

752
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,279
couldn't get the board to go in the

753
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,399
direction I want CMS had dropped

754
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,280
coverage of our number one device which

755
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,760
was tens to treat low back pain they had

756
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,159
covered it for 20 years and 60% of our

757
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,040
revenue disappeared in a period of 4

758
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,919
months you have 600 employees and when

759
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,200
60% of your revenue goes away in a very

760
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,919
short period of time, you better

761
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,440
scramble. You better be resilient.

762
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,599
So, we did. We got the company. We

763
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,960
stabilized it. We survived. But it was

764
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,639
time for me to move on because I

765
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,119
couldn't get the board to expand into

766
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,919
other areas, other technologies to

767
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,079
address pain.

768
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,000
Fast forward to the end of 2016. My

769
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:46,079
stepson has an overdose

770
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,639
in our house in the bathroom.

771
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,879
We discover him blue. Luckily, because

772
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,480
he had been going through counseling, we

773
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,480
had Narcan in the house. We revived him.

774
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,320
He's doing great. He's living in

775
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,960
Michigan. Happy that he's alive. A month

776
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,440
later, after I had been working with

777
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,240
Harvard on a microbiome project, they

778
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,480
called me and said, "We got this other

779
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,119
technology we want you to look at. We

780
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,040
don't know how to get it to market. We

781
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,240
can't get any of the big companies

782
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,680
interested. Why not? You've worked at

783
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,400
big companies. Tell us what we're

784
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,160
missing. I go down. I look at it. Within

785
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,680
a day, I tell them why. No company's

786
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,160
going to look at it for a while. They

787
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,400
believe me. About two weeks later,

788
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,680
impressed with what it could do for

789
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,200
opioid exposed babies. Barbara and I, my

790
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,839
incredible spouse partner, agreed this

791
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,640
is what we were supposed to do.

792
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,960
went back to Harvard said I want it. I

793
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,320
want to bring it to market. They said

794
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,079
okay that started the MVP journey. What

795
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,920
is the MVP? Right? Luckily some of the

796
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,400
skills that I had early in my career was

797
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,839
as a marketing analyst.

798
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,160
Right? Okay. What could this become? How

799
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,680
do customers what is the niku? What is

800
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,760
the market size? What is the

801
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,040
application? What's the competition? All

802
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,960
those things that I learned as a

803
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,000
marketing analyst early in my career, I

804
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,720
started applying to this opportunity and

805
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,560
started thinking about

806
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,200
how to bring it to market.

807
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,040
I thought this is going to be easy,

808
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,640
right? I'm going to put together some

809
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,079
slides, PowerPoint slides. I'm going to

810
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,680
get in front of some angel investors.

811
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm living in Boston. I'm living in

812
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,160
conquered mass. It's former CEO, 30 plus

813
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,200
years of experience in medical devices.

814
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,800
Harvard technology with MGH, right? And

815
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,640
University of Massachusetts, the three

816
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,560
institutions collaborated on it.

817
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,960
Got a real market need. I got

818
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,680
investigational devices developed. I've

819
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,440
got clinical studies. I've got patents.

820
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,210
I'm going to get $2 million right away

821
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,599
after my first presentation or two.

822
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:05,920
[Music]

823
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,119
Fail. Fail. Fail. Right. angel

824
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,720
investors. They're great. They're

825
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,560
wonderful, right? But at the end of the

826
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,119
day, they're hobbyists that are looking

827
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,200
to make 40 $50,000 investments, maybe 10

828
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,960
or $20,000, and they want something a

829
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,839
little bit more proven, and they want a

830
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,480
whole lot of your equity up front.

831
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,640
So, somebody told me about how to write

832
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,640
a grant, and I'm like, well, wait, how

833
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,320
do you spell grant? Even though I was a

834
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,320
former CEO, I didn't really know how to

835
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,720
spell grants,

836
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,560
let alone write one.

837
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,240
So, I went on the internet. Oh. Oh,

838
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,520
yeah. There's these things called SBI.

839
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Oh, yeah. I'll write one. No problem.

840
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,160
Spent a couple days, tossed it in. This

841
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,400
will be easy. All the same assumptions I

842
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,320
made with angel investors. I get this

843
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,920
feedback. I don't know. Couple months

844
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,480
later,

845
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,720
it wasn't scored. Wow. That that must

846
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,960
mean this is great. It was so good. They

847
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,280
didn't even score it,

848
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,240
right? No, dummy. Means it was so bad,

849
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,680
right? that nobody even wanted to give

850
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,280
it a second look. They didn't even want

851
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,760
to waste time discussing your grant

852
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,760
application.

853
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,400
Oh man. Okay, angels aren't going

854
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,599
anywhere. I'm not getting any love on

855
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,640
the grants. Oh, start a substance use

856
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,000
disorder challenge, NIH, sponsored by

857
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,119
the National Institute on Drug Abuse. I

858
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,079
think I'll apply for that.

859
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,839
$10,000 award.

860
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,079
Applied. get it and I get the $10,000

861
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,720
and I'm really excited about it. But you

862
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,160
know what the real benefit is sitting

863
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,720
right here in this room.

864
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,599
The benefit was oh you're going to get

865
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,280
to learn how to write a grant. Oh,

866
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,800
super.

867
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,119
And we're going to teach you how to do

868
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,079
it.

869
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,720
And I get on the phone with Elena

870
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,040
and she basically tells me, a former CEO

871
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,680
of a midcap company who developed a 35-y

872
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,560
year career with many of the world's

873
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,520
best companies in medical devices, is

874
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,200
going to teach me how to write a grant.

875
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,200
She lays it on the line. This is going

876
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,119
to be tough.

877
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,040
You're not going to like it. You're

878
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,400
going to do everything I tell you to do.

879
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,920
You're going to do homework. You're

880
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,680
going to submit it. I'm going to

881
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,240
evaluate it. I'm going to critique it.

882
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,800
and you're going to write it again.

883
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,760
And that went on for

884
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,079
six months.

885
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,320
Write, rewrite, write, rewrite, write,

886
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,520
rewrite.

887
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,000
Submit the grant after it.

888
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,000
Wasn't perfect.

889
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,040
Wasn't a really great score, but I got

890
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,520
scored. And I got Naida to step in and

891
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,560
give us our very first grant.

892
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,200
Amazing. This set the foundation.

893
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,240
To date, we've won over $8 million in

894
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,420
non-dilutive awards and grants.

895
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Yeah.

896
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:05,200
[Applause]

897
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,880
And taking exactly what she told me and

898
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,440
working at it year after year after

899
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,480
year. The last grant I applied to was

900
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,440
scored an 18. And we'll know in a couple

901
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,720
weeks if we've got that grant.

902
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,160
And if you're not familiar with grant

903
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,359
scores, they go from 10 to 90.

904
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,119
Lower is better. Usually 30, you're in

905
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,200
the ballpark to get funded. So getting

906
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:32,720
an 18 is pretty darn good. Going from

907
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,280
not being scored to 18 is fantastic. So

908
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,320
why do I bring up this important

909
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,800
element, right? Because in order to go

910
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,880
from an idea and a technology and

911
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
investigational devices to an MVP

912
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,400
towards commercialization, you need

913
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,920
money,

914
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,000
right?

915
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,960
And there in my opinion, my humble

916
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,599
opinion, there is no better source of

917
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:02,720
funding for a startup in this space than

918
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:06,560
the NIH and NIDA specifically.

919
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,640
This is absolutely America's seed fund.

920
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,400
And the support that you receive, and by

921
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,359
the way, I'm not getting paid for this.

922
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,119
Nothing on the side, all right? is

923
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,599
immeasurable

924
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,640
as long as you remember to stay humble

925
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,599
but driven. Right? What does

926
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,400
non-dilutive mean? It means that you're

927
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,160
not picking up the phone every week and

928
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,520
talking to 10 different investors who

929
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,440
are saying, "Why aren't you moving

930
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,720
faster?"

931
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Okay? It means that you have time to

932
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,160
think about how you're going to go to

933
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,800
market. means that you have credibility

934
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,280
when talking to physicians that are

935
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,000
interested in using your product or your

936
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,800
technology. It means that you have

937
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,520
something to show to people struggling

938
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,680
with addiction that there is a promise

939
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,319
that you are working on something that

940
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,359
will help resolve an issue.

941
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,280
That is really what you get. And oh, by

942
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,400
the way, after you get these other

943
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,079
things sorted out,

944
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,160
it's an incredible backdrop to

945
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,359
investors.

946
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,000
It's proof. It's a proof source that you

947
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,520
know what you're doing and that you have

948
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,880
a path forward towards success and

949
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,319
you've been successful in the past and

950
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,040
in all likelihood you'll be successful

951
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:27,760
in the future. It's a fantastic proof

952
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:32,920
for source to get grants. by the way

953
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,920
you can't answer these questions

954
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,599
right really really well until you write

955
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,359
a grant because you've got to answer all

956
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,280
these questions when you apply for an

957
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,280
SBI grant all these things that we

958
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,960
talked about what's your price what's

959
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,240
your go to market what what's your IP

960
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,400
right what's your cost of your product

961
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,960
what margins are you targeting how big

962
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,480
is the need

963
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,079
What's the adoption rate? What's going

964
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,240
on with reimbursement? What's going on

965
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,359
with regulatory pathway? You have to

966
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,960
understand all those. And in my opinion,

967
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,640
humble opinion is the best person to

968
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,200
write the grant is the person that's

969
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,200
leading the company. I can't tell you

970
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,880
how many people I call me up over the

971
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,119
last two years, oh, I see you've done

972
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,280
really well with some grants. Who do you

973
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,400
use?

974
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,200
And I go, I write them. No, no, you

975
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,640
don't write them.

976
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,160
You're an NBA from the University of

977
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,200
Colorado.

978
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,640
You don't write them. Come on.

979
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,200
By the way, when I went to Colorado for

980
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,920
my NBA, they used to say, we used to say

981
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,160
it's the best NBA program in the Rocky

982
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,680
Mountains. Try and name another. Okay.

983
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,880
So, um, so yeah, I can't tell you how

984
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,960
important it is to develop that skill in

985
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,960
writing grants

986
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,040
and how valuable it is. It's not just

987
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,880
about securing the funding and the

988
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,880
relationship. It's also what you learn

989
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,720
when you realize, oh, I've got to write

990
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,079
about this

991
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,040
now. I've got to I've got to write about

992
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,880
in innovation. Oh, I've got to write

993
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,040
about significance. Oh, I've got to

994
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,040
write my commercialization plan. I've

995
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,680
got to write about my team. I've got to

996
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,680
write about our facilities.

997
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,119
And you've got to write it in a

998
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,480
convincing way so that you get a low

999
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,480
score. All right, Erden, go. So in the

1000
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,000
moment that um I want to ask you about

1001
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,359
is

1002
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,680
Dr. Pafar approaches you what strikes

1003
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,240
your interest? Why are you beginning to

1004
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,160
think hey this is not just a great

1005
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,760
technology this can be a product and

1006
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,680
once more this can be a successful

1007
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,000
business.

1008
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,280
Um so the quick answer is oh my gosh

1009
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,560
you're talking about something that a

1010
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,319
baby lays down on and it helps them.

1011
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:56,400
Gee, babies laid down a lot in hospitals

1012
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,240
and at home. This could be amazing,

1013
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,720
right? It was one of the first

1014
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,680
opportunities that I saw in my career

1015
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,480
where there was a potential medical to

1016
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:10,720
consumer crossover

1017
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,040
that really got me excited. also

1018
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,760
the evidence that they had developed the

1019
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,839
link between here's the technology and

1020
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,599
the explanation of the mechanism of

1021
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,960
action for that technology to the

1022
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,280
results that they were seeing in

1023
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,960
investigational studies. All right. And

1024
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,119
to be clear, what we're doing is we're

1025
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,240
talking about what stochastic resonance

1026
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,119
does at this level because it's not just

1027
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,119
generic stoastic resonance. Okay. It's

1028
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,280
for in this application at what

1029
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,200
frequency, at what amplitude. All right,

1030
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,520
we're talking about a randomness in

1031
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,040
terms of the up and down movement, which

1032
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,440
by the way is less than half the

1033
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,920
diameter of a human hair. I brought a

1034
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,119
device for you to see it break so you

1035
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,200
can feel it for yourself. And you're

1036
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,240
talking about a randomness in a

1037
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,800
frequency bandwidth, a speed between 30

1038
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,480
and 60 hertz. And it randomizes in that

1039
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,680
speed and it randomizes in the up and

1040
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,000
down movement. And that is the

1041
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,440
brilliance of what Dr. Pafar discovered.

1042
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,760
It was that stimulation at that level

1043
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,359
which actually improved breathing. And

1044
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,720
he discovered that yes with it started

1045
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,119
with the squid and also he proved it

1046
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,960
computationally through mathematics

1047
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,960
which I can never do.

1048
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Please.

1049
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,720
Yeah.

1050
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,240
Yeah. Yeah. So why did I say um well

1051
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:41,200
some of it had to do with whether or not

1052
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:43,760
I was even really ready to I mean you

1053
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,000
know it it it at my age after my career

1054
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,000
most people say

1055
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,560
time to cash in, join a country club,

1056
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,119
play golf, you know, hang out. and um

1057
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,200
and I knew that even if I were to secure

1058
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,839
some investment right away, it was going

1059
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,440
to be a big hardship potentially on my

1060
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:08,400
family. Um so that was a big big element

1061
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:12,400
of it, right? Um the other element

1062
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:16,000
was I didn't feel that the clinical

1063
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,000
studies were robust enough to take me to

1064
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,400
clearance as fast as I want. By the way,

1065
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,680
point of clarification. All right, we

1066
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,319
discovered during our journey that it's

1067
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,480
not 510K, right?

1068
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:32,960
It's a denovo, right? A denovo is not a

1069
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:37,760
510K. A ven denovo means what? New to

1070
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:40,560
the world. New. So the FDA says we want

1071
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,839
all this safety testing, nonclinical and

1072
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,520
clinical. And we want efficacy, right?

1073
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,400
And we want you to present this to

1074
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,920
obvious. And I was feeling like I didn't

1075
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,560
even know it was going to be a denovo. I

1076
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,400
thought it was going to be a 510K plus

1077
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,400
clinical studies is what I thought

1078
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:01,440
initially. Um, by the way, resilience we

1079
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,640
applied for denovo in April 2023. We

1080
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:07,280
said they said no. FDA said no because

1081
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,040
the clinical study that we used was too

1082
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,359
small.

1083
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,599
they felt and we knew we were at risk

1084
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,760
and they moved the goalpost on

1085
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,760
cytotoxicity testing from a qualitative

1086
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,680
test to a quantitative test and by the

1087
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,400
way there is an ambasset pad in the US

1088
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,760
now in any niku that passes the new test

1089
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,839
but that didn't matter to them they

1090
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,880
wanted us to pass it and that's okay

1091
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:31,520
right um a month after the FDA told us

1092
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,000
no in April 2023 they knew another study

1093
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,280
was coming out study was published in

1094
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,319
Jamma pediatrics 181 newborns and what

1095
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,400
this technology does is it reduces as

1096
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,839
shown in the JAMA pediatric study which

1097
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,280
is what we're submitting with our new

1098
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:50,800
denovo soon to go in is that it reduces

1099
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,440
the amount of morphine that is required

1100
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,640
to help calm these babies. In fact, it

1101
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,559
over a 21-day period, these babies need

1102
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,240
44 less fewer doses when they're on our

1103
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,839
pad. So that's two a day fewer doses of

1104
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,920
morphine to calm them down. That's a

1105
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,240
good thing. It reduces their length of

1106
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,280
treatment as well. And we're just about

1107
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,599
to start analysis on a new study that we

1108
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,880
completed at TUS.

1109
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,760
There wasn't one baby who started

1110
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,920
following birth that was on our pad that

1111
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,079
was ever treated or ever required

1112
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,839
treatment with morphine.

1113
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,000
So a different study than the one that

1114
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:33,119
was just published in Jamma Pediatrics,

1115
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,119
which by the way started five years ago.

1116
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,680
So those are two principal reasons.

1117
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,559
Thanks. Great question.

1118
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,119
Please.

1119
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,720
Um, one of the things that I noticed in

1120
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,599
the case study was, um, kind of the

1121
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,119
burden on the hospitals. So, like, you

1122
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,079
know, I mean, my my twins were in a

1123
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,800
NICU, I experienced firsthand the

1124
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:58,480
craziness that the staff deals with. So

1125
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,599
I'm curious, was there any when when you

1126
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,720
guys were going to these different

1127
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,440
institutions for the clinical studies,

1128
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,599
what was kind of the response that you

1129
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,720
got from the hub? Was there a lot of,

1130
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,200
you know, uh push back with a concern of

1131
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,400
uptake? Because that's generally a big

1132
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:20,000
problem. Um, and did did any of the

1133
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:23,680
studies also look at, you know, were was

1134
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,520
there decre decreased resources like

1135
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,520
were they discharged from the hospital

1136
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,880
quicker or like did were any of them?

1137
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,200
So everybody got the question. And it

1138
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,200
was, you know, basically infants that

1139
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,800
are exposed to opioids after birth as

1140
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,040
they experience withdrawal, which is

1141
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,800
neonatal abstinence syndrome, sometimes

1142
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,040
called neonatal opioid withdrawal

1143
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,520
syndrome, right? Placed a heavy burden

1144
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,200
on the staff at hospitals. So what did

1145
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,520
we investigate? What did we find? What

1146
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,839
were hospitals saying about the

1147
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,079
situation? Well, I'm going to go back to

1148
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,960
the very first grant, right? Which is an

1149
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,720
SBI phase one. And what does an SBI

1150
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,839
phase 1 do? It tells you you need to

1151
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,319
tell us two things. You need to tell us

1152
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,400
is your technology feasible? Can it be

1153
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,800
reproduced? The question over here, can

1154
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,880
it be done accurately?

1155
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,280
Can you produce a device that's going to

1156
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,160
consistently perform the way it needs to

1157
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,400
to develop and provide the efficacy that

1158
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,000
you think it provides? And the second

1159
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,000
part of an SPR phase one is what's the

1160
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,760
commercial feasibility?

1161
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,240
And the commercial feasibility goes

1162
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:32,400
right to the heart of what

1163
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,160
the users of the product babies but in

1164
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,960
this case because they can't really talk

1165
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,359
about what they need. They do cry really

1166
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,599
well though. But there are caregivers at

1167
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,839
hospitals could explain to us what the

1168
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,559
burden is in caring for these babies and

1169
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,559
whether or not our device had promise in

1170
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,880
helping them with the burden that they

1171
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,880
had. So

1172
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,400
during my phase one grant, that's what

1173
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,559
$222,000 gave me, the opportunity to do

1174
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,160
technical feasibility and commercial

1175
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,839
feasibility. And as part of the

1176
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,680
commercial feasibility, we did several

1177
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,520
things, but I'll just reflect on one

1178
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:11,119
experience. I went to Bay State Medical

1179
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:13,760
Center in central Massachusetts. I spent

1180
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,559
a day with the head of the neonatal

1181
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,839
intensive care unit and the pediatric

1182
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,000
group uh physicians there.

1183
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,640
And the day ended with a two-hour

1184
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,280
session in a nice room where we talked

1185
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,760
and they also did surveys, completed a

1186
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:34,920
survey before we did our talk, etc. And

1187
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,920
there I met Dr. Raja Singh.

1188
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,839
The feedback was incredible. They told

1189
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,040
us that they would love something like

1190
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:45,359
this to help them care for their opioid

1191
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,160
exposed babies, which was a big issue to

1192
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,160
them. And they explained what the burden

1193
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,720
was. And they explained how constantly

1194
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,280
they had to hold these babies and how

1195
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,319
the morphine doses for some babies was

1196
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,920
just burdensome, etc. Which is all great

1197
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,319
and good. You get that in the surveys,

1198
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,160
right? You you you got that information,

1199
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,880
but it was the end in the hallway,

1200
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,920
right? That mattered so much to me. Dr.

1201
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,920
Sing came up to me and she looked at me

1202
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,680
and she said,

1203
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:19,319
"Whatever you want, however I can help,

1204
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,319
just let me know."

1205
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,359
Fast forward,

1206
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,960
we get another grant. We're going to do

1207
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,440
the study at Rainbow Baby Children's

1208
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,079
Hospital in Cleveland. The head of the

1209
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,119
uh NICU leaves for a position at the

1210
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,880
NIH. They can't do the study because the

1211
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,680
new head of the program can't do it. I

1212
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,760
need to find a replacement. Literally,

1213
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,720
where am I going to have the study done

1214
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,920
that we had gotten basically the

1215
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,520
go-ahhead from Naida to to do? I call up

1216
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,960
Tus Medical Center because it's in the

1217
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:57,760
back yard here for me.

1218
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,960
And no, I call base Bay State Dr. Singh.

1219
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,119
She's going to help. Well, she's no

1220
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,720
longer here.

1221
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,240
Where where'd she go? Oh, she went to

1222
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,119
TUS.

1223
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:10,000
Oh, okay. Call toughs. There's Dr.

1224
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:12,480
Singh. Sure, we'll do it.

1225
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,640
Relationships, collaboration, right?

1226
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,680
Support. Those are the things that, you

1227
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:21,040
know, you just need to stay on top of.

1228
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:23,280
So, long- winded answer, apologize. Um,

1229
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,280
in the studies themselves, the JAMAP

1230
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,960
pediatrics looked at length of stay. It

1231
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,640
looked at time on crib. It looked at

1232
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,200
morphine doses, cumulative morphine

1233
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,520
doses. On the new study that's going to

1234
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,280
be published in the next year coming out

1235
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,520
of TUS is going to look at length of

1236
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,640
stay, length of treatment, and whether

1237
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,079
or not any babies were where their

1238
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,000
symptoms were so severe they needed to

1239
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,400
be treated with morphine. And as I I

1240
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,640
already kind of stole it a little bit. I

1241
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,640
know just at a very high level, we

1242
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:55,079
didn't have one baby move on to morphine

1243
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,079
treatment at TUS, which was amazing.
