1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,320
startup exchange uh discussion as I said

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:12,080
earlier at the beginning uh at MIT we uh

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,960
you know we we we don't just do research

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,520
uh we do produce companies companies

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,800
that will take the research bond

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,439
findings to their uh prototype to the

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,359
market and to make an impact so that's

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,000
why we have the next session about the

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,599
startup exchange and and my my colleague

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,960
uh Katarina will moderate the session

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,960
and uh I'll just let her take over. Uh

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Katarina,

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,399
thank you CJ for the kind introduction.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,039
Hello everyone. I'm delighted to be here

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,200
with you today to present the startup

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
lightning talks. We've invited two

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,879
startups for you to meet. Each one will

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,359
present for 10 minutes followed by five

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,399
minutes of Q&A. So, please keep sending

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,400
your questions through the Q&A feature.

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,159
But first, I'd like to take a couple of

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,000
minutes to tell you about our

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,560
program. So, Startup Exchange was

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,520
created within MIT corporate relations

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,920
to support MIT connected startups to

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,040
grow, expand, and solve the world's

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,080
great challenges. And uh we do that by

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,840
fostering collaboration and partnerships

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,560
between uh startups and industry such as

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,360
um corporate members of the industrializ

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,840
program as many of you are and the MIT

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,600
innovation

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,119
ecosystem. So the startups we support

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
all of them must have a strong

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,799
connection with the institute. This

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,000
connection might come through the

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,200
founding team, the technology and some

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,079
um are also affiliated to uh our MIT

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,119
peers who vet and support the startups

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,000
throughout the year. Um today our

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,799
program has a network of close to a

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,920
thousand startups virtually working in

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
any sector. They also may be located in

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,280
any country and we typically start

45
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,599
working with them when um they have a

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,520
technology or a product that is ready to

47
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,520
be tested or used in real

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,560
environment. So everything we do at

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,879
startup exchange is to expose and

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,680
connect startups with industry in a

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,480
highly curative way and we also provide

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,560
learning opportunities to both parties.

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,200
This includes launching calls for

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,160
startups based on corporate's own

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,400
challenges and strategic priorities,

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,879
facilitating one-on-one meetings between

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,840
them, and hosting different kinds of

58
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,800
events such as demo days, um speed

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,879
networking events, speech sessions, and

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,519
the learning opportunities typically

61
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,200
come through via workshops that we uh

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,800
co-organize with our MIT peers. So at

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,840
the end of the day the goal um of all

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,159
these activities is to fold. Um on the

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,720
one hand help startups uh scale pivot

66
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,680
expand your customer base and in case of

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,000
corporates help them learn as well about

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
the most recent technologies

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,800
um help them uh expand your portfolio or

70
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,360
even create new business lines. And um

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,319
this slide features a very small sample

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,760
of the success cases we had to date uh

73
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:35,239
that usually uh include proof of concept

74
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,599
pilots um joint uh RD R&D and even

75
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,920
acquisitions. Um this is startup

76
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,159
exchange in a nutshell. If you'd like to

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,879
