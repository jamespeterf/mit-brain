1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
you should be able to answer a question

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,080
that I love to ask young students when I

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,480
go out and talk in schools and that is

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,160
how far away is space. There is an

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,759
official definition of where space

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
begins that's recognized by the

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,320
International Aeronautical Federation.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,840
That's 100 kilometers the famous

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,680
funarman line about 62 miles and when

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,439
you go above this altitude you're

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,800
officially entitled to your astronaut

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,240
wings on the scale of our globe that is

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,120
about 1 and 12 cm. That's how high you

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,880
have to go to become an astronaut. I

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,960
hope you understand, however, that there

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,600
really is no abrupt boundary between the

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
atmosphere and outer space. The air just

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,680
gets thinner and thinner as you go

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,120
farther away from the Earth's surface.

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,160
So, when you really think about it,

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,399
space isn't very far away. It's closer

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,480
than New York City is to Boston or

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
London is to Paris.
