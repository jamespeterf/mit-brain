1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,080
thanks Ben thanks for having me and

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,679
excited certainly to talk about our work

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,200
here uh as Ben mentioned my name's John

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,160
Leu uh my background really is uh first

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,680
physics mechanical engineering and

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,800
started to Pivot towards issues in

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,960
manufacturing uh during my post-doctoral

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,160
work and at this point um I teach

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,960
mechanical engineering at MIT and I

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,720
specifically lead a group that tackles

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,119
issues in learning engineering my group

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,399
we are using design principles to solve

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,000
challenges in learning to essentially

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,480
meet nextg learning uh issues in stem

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,320
competencies and we do that essentially

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,640
through three thrusts uh one uh we're

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,440
looking at new learning Technologies how

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,640
do we develop and design arvr everyone

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,719
is doing that these days but how do we

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,680
do that in a thoughtful way uh to

21
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,760
actually scale and enhance stem pedagogy

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,520
uh number two digital learning so my

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,640
group actually manages the uh Department

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,000
of mechanical engineering's portfolio on

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,199
Mass of open online courses and then

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
three which is really what I'll be

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,479
focusing on today uh is we're working on

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,439
future generation uh stem Workforce so

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,720
let's go there let's go there now I

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,320
usually like to start with some high big

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,080
picture data uh what you're seeing here

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,159
is manufacturing productivity over time

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,680
um actually from Ben Armstrong's work

34
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,720
here uh what you're seeing here is peer

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,640
groups um like EU Germany Japan uh

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,439
really increasing in productivity in the

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,680
past few decades what you see on the Y

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,079
AIS is value added per employee and

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,520
Manufacturing firms across countries and

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,200
groups and the US is in purple uh We've

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,640
stagnated over the past one plus decade

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,079
and this is quite a big uh of of a

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,000
concern now we know that a primary

44
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,040
driver of uh productivity is technology

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
adoption so we could take a step further

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,560
and take a look at uh what are firms

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,240
doing to adopt Technologies and and and

48
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,320
to what extent they're doing that so

49
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,840
again what you're seeing on the y axis

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,799
is uh robots installed per 10,000

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360
employees it's a little hard to quantify

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,800
adoption of digital Technologies or iot

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,640
Technologies but we can count robots on

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,239
a floor and so you're seeing again um

55
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,920
peers like Germany or Japan you know the

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,160
kind of typical players that you'd

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,519
expect and the US is all the way down

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,440
here at number 10 uh not only is that

59
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,519
concerning but also by density it's uh

60
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,200
less than a third of the

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,239
leader and so this uh certainly begs uh

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,720
the the the the the question you know we

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,280
know that advanced Manufacturing

64
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,599
Technologies you know from robotics to

65
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,879
digital production it can transform the

66
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,200
factory but it definitely requires uh

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,480
kind of worker to implement it uh the

68
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,959
issue is these people need to integrate

69
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,959
Technologies uh new technologies into a

70
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,840
current system so often you have a bunch

71
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,239
of Legacy equipment that you might want

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,680
to bring in a new piece of equipment

73
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,280
there's never uh kind of transformation

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
overnight and so one has to understand

75
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,159
in order to integrate new technology one

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,599
has to understand a larger picture uh

77
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,799
systems level so how do you drive techn

78
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,440
technological advances and drive that

79
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,040
Innovation and when I speak to firms

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,920
many companies say hey I wish Engineers

81
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,440
had Hands-On skills I wish technicians

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,159
had analytical

83
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,400
skills uh and it begs the question do we

84
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,519
actually just need a new kind of worker

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,439
not to just run the machine but to

86
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,799
integrate the system and Al integrate

87
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,959
these Technologies and that kind of new

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,000
worker I'm calling the technologist and

89
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,599
so we set out to test this hypothesis uh

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,840
when we interviewed over 30 firms in New

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,280
England manufacturing companies who are

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,040
involved um that we were connected with

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,120
and what we're doing here is we're

94
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,319
taking BLS uh tasks task definitions uh

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,760
in engineering from the bureau labor of

96
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,239
statistics and we're asking companies

97
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,760
one do you see this gap between

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,519
technicians and engineers and if so uh

99
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,239
look at these engineering tasks which

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,400
ones would you actually want uh

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,840
technologist to do on the floor and what

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,360
we're finding here is companies are

103
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,959
saying that they wish that they had a

104
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,799
technologist someone in that bridge

105
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,120
occupation to be able to analyze

106
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,359
performance of systems equipment to

107
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,320
determine operational methods to analyze

108
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,840
data to improve operations to monitor

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,600
these operations on a meta kind of meta

110
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,520
summary it's someone with strong

111
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,639
analytical skills someone who can

112
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,360
identify areas to increase efficiency or

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,440
productivity someone who can communicate

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
uh both up and down and now these might

115
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,080
look like familiar engineering

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,840
competencies but the point here is this

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,240
is someone who's on the shop floor

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
someone who is in the technical

119
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,000
Workforce and so the takeaway here is

120
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,199
really that advanced manufacturing

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,120
requires workers with both the

122
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,039
technician's Practical knowhow

123
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,759
understanding the equipment and the

124
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,160
actual process and an engineering's

125
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,360
comprehension of processes and

126
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,080
systems now of course that begs the

127
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,919
question well okay but how do we

128
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,280
actually Dev Vel this kind of Workforce

129
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,000
uh we want to be able to get to Advanced

130
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,720
manufacturing but to get there uh to

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,320
develop this kind of Workforce we

132
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
actually have to address a primary

133
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,720
challenge in advanced manufacturing

134
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,800
Workforce Development namely that

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,160
advanced manufacturing impacts Workforce

136
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,199
by reducing the shelf life of technical

137
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,440
skills so if you want to be serious

138
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,080
about getting a Workforce that can do

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,199
Advanced manufacturing we have to be

140
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,560
able to be serious about tackling this

141
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,639
challenge now to kind of intro this

142
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,039
concept here or the challenge one could

143
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,240
kind of summarize how we treat

144
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,199
conventional manufacturing training uh

145
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,000
using this old adage give a man a fish

146
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,039
feed him for a day train a man to fish

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,199
eat them for a lifetime and that kind of

148
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,759
summarizes how we've been approaching

149
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,400
how to train our manufacturing Workforce

150
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,000
in the past 00 years plus the problem is

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,960
if you extend this analogy to Advanced

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,120
manufacturing it's really more like this

153
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,360
person needs to fish this year and hunt

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,160
deer in two and trop Lobster in five

155
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,199
years and the question is if you knew

156
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,680
this a priority would you actually train

157
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,720
or educate your Workforce in the same

158
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,400
way now in the first case uh when you

159
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,440
are going to be uh fishing your entire

160
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,160
life it makes sense let's just focus on

161
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,520
the fishing skills uh how to how to work

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,039
with your tackle or your bait but in the

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,160
in the right hand case in advanced

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,960
manufacturer when your game is changing

165
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,520
it might not make sense to pick up a

166
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
skill set and throw it out and pick up

167
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,280
another skill set in this case it might

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,919
actually make sense to take a step back

169
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,560
and think about what are the principles

170
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,919
that underg all of these activities even

171
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,599
if they do change that don't change no

172
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,520
matter uh which year you're in no matter

173
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,639
which generation you're in in that case

174
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,840
maybe the why of uh of game and hunting

175
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,759
and in this case may perhaps in this

176
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,080
analogy perhaps it would be something

177
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,759
around animal sense for example how do

178
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,800
you take advantage of animal senses to

179
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,599
bait how do you take advantage of animal

180
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,759
senses to hide from these animals and so

181
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,879
well it turns out that in manufacturing

182
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,879
in the past two decades uh here at MIT

183
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,360
we've been able to distill a set of

184
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,599
principles in manufacturing uh that are

185
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,240
so core to manufacturing they actually

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,000
don't change these are what we would

187
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,360
call the wise why of manufacturing

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,520
namely that regardless of which industry

189
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,319
or company you always have to understand

190
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,240
the concepts of flow and variation along

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,199
four levels and the levels are

192
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,280
manufacturing processes systems Supply

193
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,800
and people and it doesn't matter whether

194
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,840
you're in 1800's printing press or you

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,080
are in uh 2050 you will always have to

196
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,120
be able to manage flow and variation

197
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,680
along these levels and in fact this is

198
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,520
how we teach our Master students at MIT

199
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,039
namely the masters of engineer

200
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,440
engineering and advanced manufacturing

201
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,960
design and five years ago I help helped

202
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,240
stand up a program called the

203
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,319
micromasters which takes this these set

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,800
of principles and classes turns it into

205
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,599
an online program when we were targeting

206
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,960
Professional Engineers and to this date

207
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,240
we've at this point enrolled over

208
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,639
200,000 uh unique Learners across the

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,120
globe so we know that these principles

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,319
are actually incredibly powerful in the

211
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,639
in the industry and the question is does

212
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,280
it make sense then to use this to be

213
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,280
able to educate the rest of the

214
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,120
workforce right not just Master's level

215
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,000
but folks who don't have University

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,440
degree

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,560
and so this is our curriculum uh uh kind

218
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,279
of design where we have essentially a

219
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,120
hub and spoke model in the hub is what I

220
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,240
just talked about the process the system

221
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
the the supply the people that's the

222
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,839
part that doesn't change that's the why

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,200
of manufacturing and around that we can

224
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,399
structure what we call the spokes that's

225
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,800
the how of manufacturing digital

226
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,880
manufacturing and additive manufacturing

227
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,839
microelectronics those things are

228
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,079
specific to companies they are specific

229
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,519
to a generation robotics in 2024 will be

230
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,279
different than robotics in 2030 and so

231
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,720
our approach here then is to empower the

232
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,920
workforce by educating on that critical

233
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,519
thinking why the things that don't

234
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,959
change and then link it to The Cutting

235
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,399
Edge how this the things that are

236
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,959
changing and so if your Workforce

237
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,720
actually knows uh and understands the

238
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,560
why then they're not tied to a piece of

239
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,200
equipment when a new one when you're

240
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,920
interested in integrating something else

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,279
they can continue to operate effectively

242
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,480
if you're not tied to recipes you might

243
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,560
be able to think about how might

244
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,880
something be done differently how might

245
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,240
something be done better you might be

246
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,040
able to think through trade-offs and

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,680
then if you're not just tied to being

248
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,200
told what to do you might be able to

249
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,079
make recommendations or contribute to

250
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,040
decision making and so we see that this

251
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,720
is a Broadway to empower really the

252
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,959
larger part of the manufacturing

253
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,959
Workforce those without University

254
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,360
degrees and you might be wondering okay

255
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,760
great what does that person actually do

256
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,120
um these are more operational level uh

257
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,240
definitions of the tasks we would

258
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,720
imagine a technologist do like detecting

259
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
and analyzing changes and problems in

260
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,240
operations uh employing design of

261
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,000
experiments for process optimization uh

262
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,720
even making recommendations based on

263
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,839
their understanding of how a process can

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
be pushed making recommendations back to

265
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,760
the design team hey you can make this

266
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,120
well thinner or you can actually change

267
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,200
this parameter here and etc etc

268
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,279
optimizing flow through systems and so

269
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,880
turns out that industry mapping really

270
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,040
works very well these these in priority

271
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,680
competencies really map very well to our

272
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,160
Hub and spoke

273
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,160
model now we see this technologist not

274
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,519
just as a connector in operations I've

275
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,360
already mentioned that they could Bridge

276
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,040
tasks between technicians and Engineers

277
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,959
but also along three other levels one

278
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,120
one could imagine a star technician

279
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,480
becoming a star technologist and then

280
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,959
after year more education a star

281
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,360
technolog is becoming a star engineer

282
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:01,920
and so uh can we provide and create a

283
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,240
new career pathway in manufacturing

284
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,519
that's formalized uh and also companies

285
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,079
are seeing that well I'm paying my

286
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,680
technician 20 plus I'm paying my

287
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:15,800
engineering 40 plus perhaps there's also

288
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,440
a wage Gap that we can fill using this

289
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,959
technologist role to be able to connect

290
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:26,079
these uh different roles and education

291
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,360
often is disjoint we have uh associate

292
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,320
degrees being offered by community

293
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,200
colleges we have University degrees Rees

294
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
uh that are four-year programs usually

295
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,600
if someone with an associates degree

296
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
wants to do a bachelor's degree they

297
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,839
have to start completely over but I have

298
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,360
universities in New England who are

299
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,399
saying hey if MIT offers this program

300
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,519
people take it in a community college I

301
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,760
want to offer Credit in my four-year

302
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,440
engineering technology degree and so we

303
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,320
can connect in education as well and the

304
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,240
final thing is our dissemination

305
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,240
Partners namely community colleges in

306
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,079
the area are serving areas that are in

307
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,720
rural areas or have high levels of

308
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,240
poverty and so we can Bridge or connect

309
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,720
opportunities as

310
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,639
well this is just a a sample uh uh of

311
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,199
what the kinds of uh the kind of

312
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,560
manufacturing Workforce training system

313
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:19,040
that I'm planning on creating uh we will

314
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,360
be launching in the fall of 2025 but you

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,320
can see a number of different uh

316
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
community colleges interspersed through

317
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,000
Massachusetts Rhode Island and

318
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,519
Connecticut and we're currently focused

319
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,040
on Aerospace and defense and also uh

320
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,519
submarine industrial

321
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,760
base uh for more for more uh you know I

322
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,560
published in a National's Journal policy

323
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,680
facing uh earlier this year we where we

324
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,360
make uh kind of a larger argument for

325
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,199
this new occupation the technologist so

326
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,320
feel free to take a look and then on the

327
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,760
right hand side that's just more

328
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,199
information from MIT news on the project

329
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,440
itself so thanks so much for your time

330
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,440
and uh happy to take any questions

331
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,639
John it looks like that we have a

332
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,320
question in the chat how how can you

333
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,440
split each of the principles I I think

334
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,920
that um they might be referring to the

335
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,839
hub principles uh saying they're they're

336
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,160
too wide was was the comment

337
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,000
so can you can you go in a little more

338
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:25,199
depth into the Hub definitely absolutely

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,839
so um what we're really interested in is

340
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:31,199
you know what kinds of information and

341
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,680
insights are available on the shop floor

342
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:36,279
that someone uh who is in shop floor

343
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,480
operations can actually take advantage

344
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,160
of right so we have companies who are

345
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,959
saying hey I have you know my star

346
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,680
technician or Star operator I want to

347
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,160
promote them to become a sell leader um

348
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,000
or a shift leader but I have no way of

349
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,759
getting them there right now they just

350
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,519
like I just promote them and the next

351
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,959
day they have this hat uh what kinds of

352
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,279
technical skills are actually actionable

353
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,160
on the shop floor so for manufacturing

354
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,560
processes what we're doing is we are

355
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,959
starting to give them a basic set of

356
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,320
statistical process control and

357
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,839
troubleshooting for processes so on

358
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,000
statistical process control we're

359
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,519
looking at uh creating run charts we're

360
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,560
looking at design of experiments anovas

361
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,160
linear and nonlinear regression things

362
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,720
that you know these technicians and

363
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,160
operators they're looking at the process

364
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,720
every single day they should be the ones

365
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,440
who can inform the engineers hey these

366
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,440
are ways that our process could be

367
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,680
refined but they don't have the skill

368
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,160
set yet right and so we want to be able

369
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,040
to give them a basic engineering skill

370
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,600
set to do that on the system side and

371
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,800
I'll just choose these two as as

372
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,000
examples on the system side um you know

373
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,720
one could say uh you know I think our

374
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,519
technicians are so tied to a piece of

375
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,360
equipment but there's really Concepts

376
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,160
around flow uh troubleshooting uh around

377
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,519
uh identifying bottlenecks how do we

378
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,920
alleviate those and so that is a big

379
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,320
piece I think that we're looking at

380
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,720
these folks were involved with the flow

381
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,399
of of product and components through the

382
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,839
line they don't really actually

383
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,959
understand how a system works and how we

384
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:14,240
can optimize it um and so that's that's

385
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,360
how I would you know a couple examples

386
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,759
on a little bit more detail around those

387
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,399
uh principles certainly and it also

388
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:23,360
seems like there's there's the advantage

389
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,519
I I I think about it from an employers

390
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,639
perspective why would you send one of

391
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,720
your operators for example to this

392
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,160
program what you know conrete value

393
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,720
would they um would they experience and

394
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,560
I think one is just being able to

395
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,720
interact more efficiently with the

396
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,880
engineering team if they're um currently

397
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,680
don't really have the language to to

398
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,120
have certain conversations about you

399
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,160
analyzing the data that are coming off

400
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,680
the off the line this could really you

401
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,600
know lead them to more added value the

402
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,639
the another question that comes through

403
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,639
uh there's someone in the audience who's

404
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,319
amazed that you don't reference

405
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,519
generative AI as a mentoring coaching

406
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,319
tutoring tool I I'm not amazed for a

407
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,560
variety reasons but I I wonder what your

408
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,880
perspective on on using generative AI as

409
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,759
part of your teaching is um irrespective

410
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,959
of using it on the factory floor yeah I

411
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,600
mean I I think there's a lot of very

412
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,480
interesting work uh right now being done

413
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,720
in gen I think a lot of it is still

414
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,319
pretty early and somewhat untested um I

415
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,160
think there are there is some work uh

416
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:26,240
that's being done around using course

417
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,639
materials to train llms uh one of the

418
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,600
issues I think that we're concerned

419
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,040
about is certainly hallucination ations

420
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,240
and when you're on the manufacturing

421
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,279
floor and you get a hallucination uh you

422
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,040
know you're trained in a particular way

423
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,319
uh because these are situations where

424
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,160
safety comes an issue we're very kind of

425
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:44,160
hyper sensitive uh to incorrect guidance

426
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
and so we're going to be a little bit

427
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,000
more careful I think when it comes to

428
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,759
implementing gen um that said you know I

429
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,839
I'm not presenting on this but we have

430
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,160
another work where we're designing an

431
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,800
intelligent tutoring system in order for

432
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,199
you know workers to learn psychomotor

433
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,959
skills so that's something that we're

434
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,079
working on but I don't think it's ready

435
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,079
for roll out uh next year right this is

436
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,919
like a re these are research projects

437
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,959
what I'm presenting here is this will be

438
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,000
a live program in a

439
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,880
year yeah and I just think about the

440
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,039
some of the highest performing

441
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,439
manufacturers and how they train their

442
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:21,559
workers they train them to do a process

443
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,480
analog first before they train them how

444
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,919
to operate automated systems I think

445
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,440
about BMW's um early Factory in um in

446
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,200
South Carolina they they already knew

447
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,600
how to do to to run an automated Factory

448
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,120
but they didn't introduce the automation

449
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,480
until the workers knew how to um you

450
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,679
know understand the processes without

451
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,120
the automation uh introduced and I feel

452
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,400
like that's the Hub before you learn

453
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,679
about robotics you're learning about the

454
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,799
Hub and the core uh kind of Timeless um

455
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,440
art of manufacturing absolutely yeah and

456
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,120
that's really what this is about like I

457
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,679
this is why often I'll shy away from the

458
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,080
word Workforce training because I think

459
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,600
training is very much on the how like

460
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,840
how do you operate a piece of equipment

461
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,320
whereas we're very much interested in

462
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,039
principles and conceptual understanding

463
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,679
and Analysis here so I would consider

464
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,919
this more on the education side which I

465
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,039
think MIT is much better Set uh set up

466
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,280
to do yeah and and you know I I find

467
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:20,600
this all very exciting I think it

468
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,600
responds to a real need that we hear um

469
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,840
that we hear about from employers and

470
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,000
you've been working on this now for for

471
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,039
years and you're going to deploy it in

472
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,919
Fall 2025 what's your biggest concern or

473
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,640
the biggest risk you think about with

474
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,640
deploying this project you know what are

475
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,480
you what really needs to come together

476
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,679
for it to succeed that you're not really

477
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,360
sure is there

478
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,320
yet uh that's a really

479
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,039
interesting uh that's a really

480
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:54,880
interesting question Ben I think there's

481
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:59,919
uh maybe two things that that come up to

482
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,000
mind um one is we are trying to take

483
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,960
you know this this this thing is a

484
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,360
essentially it's a on the education side

485
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,640
it's this big experiment on can we

486
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,200
actually take grad

487
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,840
level uh material from

488
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,200
MIT uh and and adapt it so that we can

489
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,080
educate folks without a University

490
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,480
degree without understanding of calculus

491
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,200
without exposure to statistics uh can we

492
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,679
kind of embed all of what you need to

493
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,760
understand just as we're posing problems

494
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,440
in the program uh and a context or

495
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,280
situation and so you know we flip the

496
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,000
pedagogy so that right you know

497
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,440
University level pedagogy often you are

498
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,080
introducing math concepts first and then

499
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,600
like in week 10 you're applying them um

500
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,919
in our program we are doing the reverse

501
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,760
like we present them with uh your line

502
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,080
is down or like your parts are out of

503
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,679
spec what are you going to do and we

504
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,400
time it so that every single week uh we

505
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,080
are they're just picking up the math

506
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
tool or the technique that they need to

507
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,039
solve that problem and obviously the

508
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,679
tools and the techniques and the

509
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,760
problems become more and more advanced

510
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,159
but it is a big experiment on our end

511
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,240
because we are you know kind of tying

512
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,320
from uh you know grad level courses that

513
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,400
usually have a pretty deep understanding

514
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,360
on the math like the Manufacturing

515
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,360
Systems the MIT version of Manufacturing

516
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,400
Systems like you are learning Markov

517
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,360
chains by week two um so like how do we

518
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,679
translate that material so that someone

519
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,600
like a I think in theory it sounds

520
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,559
simple like oh just you know then they

521
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,360
just need to use the tools uh but I

522
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,559
think in practice to be able to create

523
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,280
something uh that is we're very much in

524
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,159
the weeds there I think another one is

525
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,440
just the interactions with companies so

526
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,840
like when a company wants to send right

527
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,000
now this is a Clos enrollment program

528
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,720
and what I what I mean by that is we're

529
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,480
not going to just give this to a

530
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,520
community college for them to offer to

531
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,360
anyone we're only going to launch this

532
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,880
program if there are companies in that

533
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,679
region around a community College who

534
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,000
are saying we are going to send enough

535
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,679
employees to fill out the cohort namely

536
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,679
15 students per cohort and I think the

537
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,919
interesting thing the challenge will be

538
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,080
to work with these companies to see can

539
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,000
they actually fully utilize a

540
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,880
technologist like perhaps their

541
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,520
operations really are more on

542
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,159
conventional models that aren't

543
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,200
interested in technology adoption maybe

544
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,440
they're interested in like a Delta a

545
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,799
small Delta in in productivity but all

546
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,760
of a sudden they have a technologist who

547
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,880
like understands these principles and

548
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,799
wants to integrate technology how do we

549
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,360
work with this company to kind of shift

550
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:36,000
the conversation and you know that's a

551
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,880
larger conversation then it's not just

552
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,159
how do we use this technology uh

553
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,279
technologist but it's an organizational

554
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,760
conversation you know it's it's also

555
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,440
about risk and investment and so I would

556
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,640
I would anticipate that's a longer term

557
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,960
conversation but it's certainly you know

558
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,919
one of the challenges that we're looking

559
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,400
forward to engaging in well John that's

560
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,600
the perfect segue to what I'm going to

561
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,679
talk about so this uh it's a than and

562
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,240
and I do think

563
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,679
your your first comment that this is

564
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,120
really a leap of faith in um in workers

565
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,600
who have a ton of untapped talent and

566
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,279
skills and you're opening them up you're

567
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,880
you're essentially saying welcome to to

568
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,320
MIT even though you might not have a

569
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
college degree welcome to an MIT

570
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,559
graduate curriculum and then the

571
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,640
question is will employers actually make

572
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:21,640
use of the of the untapped talent and

573
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,000
skills that you're trying to cultivate

574
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,360
so I I I it's a very exciting experiment

575
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,200
I think it has a ton of promise and uh

576
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,200
if anyone is is uh in the audience who's

577
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,640
interested in learning more um feel free

578
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
to I think to reach out and I'm not sure

579
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,120
if you're expanding your network of

580
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
employers quite yet but um but I think

581
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,000
it's always good to get more uh employer

582
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,840
interest

583
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,159
absolutely

584
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,520
great okay we're we're moving right

585
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:55,080
along thank you John I thought that was

586
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,080
a a terrific um kickoff to the morning
