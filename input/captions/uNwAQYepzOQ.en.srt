1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
Next, we will have our last speaker, Dr.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,160
Masashi Hirose. He is the co-founder and

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:14,440
CEO of NanoQT, who is working on very

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,800
exciting key technologies to enable

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,680
modular quantum networks and

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,040
communications. So, it's all yours,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,880
Masashi.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,560
Thank you for the introduction. Um, hi

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,720
everyone. My name is Masashi Hirose. I'm

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,120
CEO of NanoQT.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,600
Um, it's a special pleasure for me to

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,160
speak here today. I did my PhD at MIT in

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,920
quantum technologies about, um, just a

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,360
decade ago. And it's amazing to see how

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,680
far the quantum industry and also

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,400
initiative at MIT evolves, uh, in the

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,000
last, uh, decade. And it's also honor to

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,720
follow, um,

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,200
great talk by Professor, you know,

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,600
Donner and also Bill, and also Takaya

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,840
from Qera.

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,640
Because NanoQT is among the many who

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,040
deeply believe in the long-term

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,880
scalability of neutral atom system.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,280
And our work is indeed to build to

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,000
extend their advantage into the next

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,840
phase of quantum computing.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,120
NanoQT, um, is a Japan-based hardware,

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,040
uh, quantum quantum hardware startup

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,840
developing a key missing component in

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
the industry, that is a quantum

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,880
interconnect. The hardware foundation

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,760
for modular, scalable, and networked

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,840
quantum computing.

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,000
In the next few minutes, I'll cover who

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,400
we are,

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,120
the coming scalability challenge, and

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,920
our solutions, uh, the nanofiber cavity

39
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,920
interconnect.

40
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,520
Let me start from the overview of the

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,560
company. Um,

42
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,680
NanoQT develops a quantum interconnect

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
technologies and also system

44
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,360
architecture for quantum, uh, computing

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,360
and communication.

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,640
Our core technology, uh, is engineering

47
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,520
capability of an ultra-low loss

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,600
nanofiber cavity to enable the cavity

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,080
quantum electrodynamics, which is called

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,400
cavity QED.

51
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,760
Which has been well-known phenomena in

52
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,800
the physics textbook for decades, but

53
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,960
the commercializations of cavity QED

54
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,320
technologies, especially for quantum

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,880
information processing context, has been

56
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,800
very challenging because engineering the

57
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,960
ideal cavity is very, very hard.

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,320
After a decade of R&D work in here in

59
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,680
Japan, uh, we overcome, uh, the

60
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,800
challenges, and that's how we founded

61
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,640
the NanoQT in in a two 2022.

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
We are still early phase, but in the

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,800
last, uh, three years, uh, we rapidly

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,560
expand the operation, uh, including the

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,680
development of IP, and also we form the

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,520
one of the largest quantum hardware team

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,520
in Japan, consisting of, uh, 15, more

68
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,480
than 15, uh, PhD scientists engineer,

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,920
including, uh, three MIT alumni, and

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,040
also we have a one MIT professor as one

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,800
of the scientific advisors.

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,320
And we are supported by a venture

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,720
capitals in Japan, United States, and

74
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,600
United Kingdom. And we also backed by

75
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,480
the, uh, government support. And, uh,

76
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,800
technology development, uh, also

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,200
supported by a collaboration with, uh,

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,960
you know, other, uh, universities and,

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,960
um, companies, including Qera.

80
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,000
So, uh,

81
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,520
what the visions of NanoQT is to really

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,440
develop the quantum, uh, networking of

83
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,080
the quantum computers.

84
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,000
So, if we look at the, uh, current

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,320
quantum, uh, computing hardware today,

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,680
it remains fundamentally monolithic.

87
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,400
A single quantum, a single QPU must hold

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,720
host all qubits locally, and this

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,440
architecture will hit the limit.

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,000
For example, in the neutral atom

91
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,720
systems, the number of qubits, uh, per

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,960
unit is limited by, uh, laser power,

93
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,360
optical access, and imaging resolution,

94
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,960
etc., which constrain how large a single

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,000
device can become.

96
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,720
So, the projection is around 100,000

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,720
qubits, but we'll definitely definitely

98
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,200
need to change kind of architecture to

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,480
to be a, uh, large systems with more

100
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,080
than millions of qubits.

101
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,160
And the second bottleneck of this

102
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,560
monolithic structures is that the

103
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,840
today's QPUs are completely decoupled

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,959
from quantum communications, which is

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,760
another actually quantum advantage we

106
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,760
should capture.

107
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,080
What we want to achieve here from from

108
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,920
from here is to develop the networked

109
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,040
and modularized quantum, uh, like QPU.

110
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,240
And in this world, like multiple QPUs

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,960
linked through the interconnects, behave

112
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,880
as one larger logical processor,

113
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,520
allowing qubits scale to grow, uh,

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,760
without the constraint of a single

115
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,400
device.

116
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,200
And also entanglement distributed over,

117
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,720
um, long distances by optical fibers

118
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,800
integrate the quantum computing with

119
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,000
communication, enabling the multi-site

120
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,040
and multi-user quantum operations.

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,160
To drive these transitions, we need a

122
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,160
device called a quantum interconnect.

123
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,640
So,

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,680
what the should a quantum interconnect

125
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,680
actually look like? So, we think that

126
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,920
the

127
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,440
three key elements are critical to

128
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,000
design

129
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,000
the quantum interconnect. First, the

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,800
cavity QED system unlocks the

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,040
efficiency. We need a device

132
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,680
designed along the cavity QED to drive

133
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,040
the efficient

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,720
media conversion between matter qubits

135
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,320
and a flying qubits.

136
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,560
And a second,

137
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,080
optical fiber remains very effective in

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,160
even in a quantum context in order to

139
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,520
carry a flying qubits like a photons

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,480
across distances. And how we kind of

141
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,480
integrate into the optical fiber is is a

142
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,080
critical from architecture perspective.

143
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,360
And the thirdly, QPU-centric is very

144
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,000
essential.

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
And I want to emphasize this at the

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,640
point because most of the market

147
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,120
solutions claimed as a quantum

148
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,040
interconnect is indeed operating as off

149
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,000
unit.

150
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,320
What we believe is that direct

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,520
integration into the QPU is essential to

152
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,680
achieve the minimum loss and a latency

153
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,560
and required for the quantum computing.

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,760
So, these principles leads to our

155
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,200
solutions for the fiber-based quantum

156
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,280
interconnect, which is fully end-to-end

157
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,240
waveguide cavity architectures

158
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,080
and natively integrated into the neutral

159
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,800
atom-based QPUs.

160
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,040
And that architecture allows us to, you

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,240
know, drive the systems in high

162
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,360
bandwidth aligned with the QPU clock

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,600
rate of the neutral atom-based QPU.

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,800
What enabled this to realization the

165
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,480
technology comes from actually

166
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,200
proprietary device called ultra-low-loss

167
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,480
nanofiber cavity systems, which only

168
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,760
NanoQT has the capability to develop.

169
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,000
This unique actually the cavity systems

170
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,520
host consists of

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,440
nanofiber regions, which whose a

172
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,800
diameter is around like a few hundred

173
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,080
nanometers.

174
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,560
And that nanofiber region is sandwiched

175
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,039
by a pair of the fiber Bragg gratings

176
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,720
developed at the core of the fiber.

177
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,160
This actually millimeter lengths of

178
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,800
long,

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,680
you know, the cavity systems can host

180
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,320
like hundreds of neutral atoms at the

181
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,400
same times.

182
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,960
And we actually make this device

183
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,160
from the commercially available optical

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,000
fibers

185
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
without actually

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,800
adding

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,640
substantial loss.

188
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,840
And the current performance of the

189
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,720
cavities is characterized by a number

190
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,560
called finesse aligned like the 4,000.

191
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
Which actually enables us to drive the

192
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,479
strong coupling regimes of the matter

193
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,479
qubits and photons.

194
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,240
And this architecture allows us to

195
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,520
seamlessly integrate into the

196
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,360
neutral atom-based QPU thanks to the

197
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,560
actually common technologies such as

198
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
optical tweezers.

199
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,760
So, we can directly install this cavity

200
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
systems inside the chambers of the glass

201
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,560
cells of the,

202
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,200
you know, neutral atom-based QPU

203
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,200
systems.

204
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,840
So, lastly,

205
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,840
um

206
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,760
just let me conclude from the the

207
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,840
potential collaborations opportunities.

208
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,479
We are looking for technology partners,

209
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,200
strategic investment partners in

210
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,400
different dimensions. Um What first is a

211
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,960
technology co-development, especially

212
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,240
around development of ultra-low-loss

213
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,599
optical fiber, nanofabrication and

214
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,280
packagings.

215
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,120
And also,

216
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,960
we are looking for the partners to

217
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,280
generate the use case

218
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,960
because our device modularize the

219
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,720
standalone QPUs to be multi-users

220
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,720
QPU set you know, distant locations.

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,680
This adds the new functionality to the

222
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,320
QPU and a lot of like actually potential

223
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,600
use cases to be explored.

224
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,080
And lastly, we are also looking for

225
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,040
investment opportunity from kind of

226
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,600
strategic players.

227
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,440
And yeah, that's all. Thank you very

228
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,839
much and I look forward to the the

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,560
conversation.

230
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,200
Oh, lastly, yeah, we have a lot of

231
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,520
actually the technology publication

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,120
behind what I, you know, what I

233
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,240
presented today. And if you're

234
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,880
interested in, I would recommend to, you

235
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,320
know, access to those, you know,

236
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,440
literatures to understand our

237
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,959
technologies and application, too.

238
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,079
Thank Thank you. Masashi, thank you so

239
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,360
much. And since we are running out of

240
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,120
time, so we won't be able to have Q&A,

241
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,680
but I would encourage you our audience

242
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,400
to reach out to Masashi on their website

243
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,640
at NanoQT or you can come to us,

244
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,800
iop.mit.edu,

245
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,800
if you want to follow up.
