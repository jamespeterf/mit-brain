1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:01,820
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,780
I'm Sam Madden.

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm very pleased to have Tye
Brady here from Amazon Robotics.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Thanks, Sam.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,720
We're just going to learn
a little bit about how

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,840
AI, and generative
AI in particular,

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,800
is affecting the
robotics industry.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,360
So let's just--
maybe, Tye, you want

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,700
to say a little bit
about your background.

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,033
First of all, it's just great
to be back on campus here.

11
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,700
I'm a graduate.

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,500
I spent about a decade
here in the '90s.

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,680
I was here when the internet
came to be a thing here

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,560
in the '90s.

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,479
I started programming in
the '70s, personal computers

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,600
in the '80s, here
at MIT in the '90s.

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,060
I've done a fair amount of
automation and robotics.

18
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,320
What I do-- my title is
I'm the Chief Technologist

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,945
for Robotics at Amazon.

20
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:43,320
We have the world's
largest fleet

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,540
of industrial mobile robots
out there in the world.

22
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,680
Very applied, very
practical is what we do.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,960
We really believe in a
collaborative philosophy

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,480
of people and machines
working together.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,040
And the age of
physical AI is here.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,870
We have grown quite considerably
over the last decade.

27
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,010
We ship billions and billions
of packages every year--

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,990
billions.

29
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,750
About 75% of every package
that's delivered actually

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,350
goes through one of
our robotic systems.

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,850
We're really proud to be here
in the greater Boston area.

32
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,710
Our world headquarters are
here in greater Boston area.

33
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,950
And what a time to be
in robotics, for sure.

34
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,450
Awesome.

35
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:28,890
Cool.

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,570
Well, I'm excited to
hear more about it.

37
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,910
So I think maybe we'll start off
by just talking about, what's

38
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,090
the state of robotics today?

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,310
And then we can
transition into--

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,810
Yeah, I brought a
little home video,

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,230
if you like, just to set
some context, really,

42
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,690
about this application
of physical AI systems.

43
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,707
So it's the mind and the
body coming together.

44
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:50,290
We've had robotic
systems for a while,

45
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,230
but it's really a
new era where we

46
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,830
can bring AI, machine
learning, generative AI

47
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,110
to our robotic systems.

48
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,130
So I have a video
just showing really

49
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,490
the practical side of what
we do with our robotics

50
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,310
and how you get your
deliveries to your door.

51
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,298
[MUSIC PLAYING]

52
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,160
So we had a little bit
of what we do there.

53
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,360
I don't know you caught
it in the beginning.

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,900
[APPLAUSE]
Thanks.

55
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,080
I'm really proud of that.

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,800
Thank you.

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,980
Amazing team that we
have here-- a lot of MIT

58
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,898
graduates, a lot of folks
in the greater Boston area.

59
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:09,940
I'll tell you, if you
caught it in the beginning,

60
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,600
the manufacturing of those
drive units in particular,

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,340
we do all of the manufacturing,
actually, for those drive units

62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,950
right here in Massachusetts.

63
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,660
Like I said, we've manufactured
more than a million drive units

64
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,900
here in the Bay state.

65
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,420
We have about 18,000 employees
that we employ in Amazon inside

66
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,800
of Massachusetts, put about
$18 billion into the economy.

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,980
So I'm using those
stats just to show you

68
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,980
that this practical side,
the very applied side of AI

69
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,260
and robotics, when you
are solving problems

70
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,140
that people need, it
really kind of advances

71
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,080
the state of the art.

72
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,580
Yeah.

73
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,160
I mean, what I thought
was really cool about that

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,780
is that he's got
these arms, which

75
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,943
you think of industrial
robotics being

76
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:54,110
arms that move stuff around.

77
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,693
But then you had
these little, I guess

78
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:58,250
you call them drive units,
scooting on the floor,

79
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,470
with people there.

80
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,410
Can you talk a
little bit about how

81
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,430
constrained the environment
that these things--

82
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,490
are they making
autonomous decisions,

83
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,950
or are they following fixed
paths that are preplanned?

84
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,390
I mean, can you talk a little
bit about what's happening?

85
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,890
It's a great observation.

86
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,130
We've been, first of
all, the philosophy

87
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,342
that we believe,
again, as we put

88
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,050
people at the center
of robotics universe

89
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,717
is that collaborative
environment, so we

90
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:22,890
want people and machines--

91
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,770
we want to augment and
amplify human potential

92
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,670
through our machines.

93
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,450
That's our core philosophy.

94
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,970
And to do that, we do
technology development

95
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,373
with project context.

96
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:35,790
I mean, that's the best way
anything is going to get done.

97
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,415
You need a real problem-- what
problem you're trying to solve--

98
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:41,725
in order to focus the technology
to work at a high reliability.

99
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,350
And when you ship
billions of packages,

100
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,270
even if it's just a billion,
remember that 1% is 10 million.

101
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,360
I can't have 10 million
defects out there

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,200
that we're going to
have to go chase down.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
So what we're doing is
we're actually achieving,

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,760
let's say, a
world-class capability

105
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,680
in mobility and manipulation,
in identification and storage

106
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,600
and sortation and PAC-- just
real core fundamentals when

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
it comes to robotic systems.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
And our generative AI
systems, our machine

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,920
learning systems, our
AI systems that we have,

110
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,080
have really brought-- where
we had the body before, we

111
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,360
have the mind and the
body now coming together

112
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,200
at a really accelerated pace
in the last three years.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,480
Let me just talk a little bit
about the manipulation space.

114
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,040
So like I said, I
was a young Jedi

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,900
in the '70s and the '80s, and
I really enjoyed computers.

116
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,660
I really enjoyed programming.

117
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,820
And the state of
robotics was very fixed.

118
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,840
It was really-- in the
manipulation space,

119
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,120
it was maybe for welding for
the automotive industry-- very

120
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,260
fixed, precise patterns
of what it needs to do.

121
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,020
And if there's any
irregularities, forget about it.

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,900
It's out.

123
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,340
And we've come a long way over
I'd say a number of decades

124
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,700
here, where we're much
more adaptive, much

125
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,240
more modular in our approach
of how we're doing robotics.

126
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,940
So for example, the drive
units that you saw there-- we

127
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,700
started with the fabric pods.

128
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,680
Again, I'm missing
the basics here.

129
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,940
What we do is we're a
goods-to-person fulfillment

130
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,790
strategy.

131
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,620
What we used to have
inside of Amazon is

132
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,300
a person would have a cart--

133
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
you could see there--

134
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,820
we'd have a cart, and you
would walk for a long distance,

135
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,600
grab the item, put it into
a cart, go to another.

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,440
I'll grab the item, put it into
a cart, and then come back,

137
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,360
pack the item out, and
off goes the order.

138
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,440
And Amazon did that
for a number of years.

139
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,420
Actually, Jeff Wilke, who's a
graduate from the Sloan School

140
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,060
here, really brought these
lean principles to mind

141
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,740
and started to
optimize that process.

142
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:48,430
Well, around 2010, Jeff saw this
kind of remarkable new idea,

143
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,610
which was a goods-to-person
type of fulfillment center--

144
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,798
fulfillment process path.

145
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,590
And instead of a person
going to the goods,

146
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,770
the goods can come
to the person, OK?

147
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,890
And that was a really giant
deal because not only was it

148
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,850
better for our employees because
they didn't have to walk so far

149
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,890
or remember everything
that they needed to pick,

150
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,450
but it was much more
efficient in terms of time,

151
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,728
but also in storage.

152
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:11,770
Because if you didn't need
those human aisle ways

153
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,770
and you can pack things
like the advanced library

154
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,990
does or pack them in as
when you go to Fenway Park,

155
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,970
all the cars there,
I can pack about 40%

156
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,173
more goods in that
same footprint, OK?

157
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:25,090
So robotics has really
enabled this revolution

158
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,612
where I can have many more
goods in the same footprint

159
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,570
and also increase the
efficiencies while making

160
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,550
it safer for our employees.

161
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,130
Aha.

162
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,789
So that worked.

163
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,890
So that was about a decade ago.

164
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,463
We started in what we call
a structured field approach.

165
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,130
So a structured field
means that there's

166
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,530
fences around the
robots, right, and we're

167
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,400
moving those goods at
will to pick stations

168
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,360
in the interface of
people and machines

169
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,200
is kind of at these stations
that we design and build.

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,000
And that is actually
very efficient

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,130
and has really changed
the game for Amazon.

172
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,140
For example, in terms of
productivity, over a decade,

173
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,440
we've hired hundreds
of thousands of people.

174
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,400
We've created hundreds,
hundreds, literally hundreds

175
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,740
of new job types
because of robotics.

176
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,022
So we gain this productivity.

177
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:13,980
But also, I don't know
if you saw in the video,

178
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,520
we had these little
green robots,

179
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,620
and what that signifies--
we actually wanted

180
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,120
a different color,
very intentional,

181
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,740
because they are
collaborative robots.

182
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,097
They don't use fiducials.

183
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:23,180
They're not behind fences.

184
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,290
They're safety certified, and
they can move goods at will.

185
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,790
Yeah.

186
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,140
Again, just the very basics--

187
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,680
moving things at will around
people in a safe manner.

188
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,600
That we rolled out
a few years ago,

189
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,200
about three or four years ago,
and we're using at our inbound

190
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,820
and outbound docks.

191
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,380
Very practical
application of just--

192
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,920
I got a stack of
stuff over here,

193
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,587
and I need it to get
to the right truck.

194
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,740
And we've had robotic
systems and AI systems

195
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,520
that actually help
sort those goods,

196
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,040
but just move it
from here to there.

197
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,340
But there's a trick.

198
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,840
I need you to move
it around people.

199
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,760
And I need for people to
understand what they're doing.

200
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,302
And I need the
machines to understand

201
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:02,220
what people are doing so that we
can better collaborate and work

202
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,933
together.

203
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:03,600
That is working.

204
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
One question about that.

205
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,400
I was thinking, as
these robots are-- like,

206
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,560
this is an incredible
planning problem--

207
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,420
just the logistics of there's
billions of packages coming

208
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,000
in and then billions of packages
that have to go out every day.

209
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,860
This is a central-- is this a
centralized planning system,

210
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,780
or is it-- do the
individual-- are

211
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,217
the individual robots
autonomously going and figuring

212
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,800
out what package
they should move now,

213
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,540
or how does it all
get coordinated?

214
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,623
It's a little bit of both.

215
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,852
First of all, there's
beauty in billions.

216
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:32,560
There really are.

217
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,360
There's beauty in
billions, right?

218
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,122
Because if you're achieving
that billions like of whatever

219
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,580
operation that
you're doing, you're

220
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,570
going to get pretty good at it.

221
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,058
You're going to get good at
it because truly, it's going

222
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:44,350
to become much more autonomous.

223
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,510
Now, there's no such
thing as 100% automation.

224
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,510
It doesn't exist.

225
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,830
That just does not exist.

226
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,070
But you want to have
high reliability systems,

227
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,850
much like aerospace systems,
where you have high reliability.

228
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,570
In terms of the
planner, it's a mix

229
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,510
of what we call our edge
devices and our cloud.

230
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,210
And now we have, I would say,
the world's best cloud system

231
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,130
out there.

232
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,770
We've been doing
it for a long time.

233
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,870
We have a tool set.

234
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,370
The same tool set
that we use inside

235
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,690
of our fulfillment operations
is available to many, many

236
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,232
businesses, and
many, many businesses

237
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:16,070
are using that tool set,
where it's a safe, secure,

238
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,410
authenticated AWS
stack that allows

239
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,123
us to do generative AI solutions
at will at really low cost.

240
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,540
So the planner
that we have is you

241
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:32,010
can think of it almost
like a flight controller

242
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,810
over at Logan, where
we can see and we're

243
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,030
saying what bots we
want to go at what time.

244
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,850
And that's all.

245
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,490
It's a massively
parallel operation.

246
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,165
And we do that all in the cloud.

247
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,290
But that's not good enough.

248
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,947
Now, there's latency between
the cloud and whatever robot

249
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:46,530
that you have.

250
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,350
So the robot needs to
be able to understand,

251
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,410
is there an object in my way?

252
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,990
It needs to understand, do
I have a potential collision

253
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,730
coming in my way?

254
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,510
And that's starting
to be embedded into--

255
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,110
or is there a person in my way?

256
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,510
Is there somebody
who's doing servicing?

257
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,690
That's all now
happening at the edge.

258
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,056
So there's this balance that
we do inside robotics of,

259
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:09,230
how much smarts do I
want to put on the edge,

260
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,870
and how much do I want
to put up in the cloud?

261
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,510
And as we progress more
and more in robotics,

262
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,950
we're seeing that the more
unstructured that you go,

263
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,715
the more details
and smart you're

264
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,090
going to have to
get on the edge.

265
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,590
Sure, sure.

266
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,210
But when you start
to get in the edge,

267
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,310
now we're talking
about you need what?

268
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,790
Lower power embedded computers
that can have their own models.

269
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,880
Maybe you don't even have the
connectivity back that you want.

270
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,120
And these are real, real
challenges that we're looking at

271
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,560
and we're starting to
solve inside of Amazon.

272
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,240
So it's really incredible
to see literally 3,000,

273
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,760
4,000 of these bots working
together with each other,

274
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,447
learning from each other,
learning where they can be

275
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:57,280
stronger, learning where
they can be better,

276
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,900
and then often you see the
system be optimized right

277
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,840
in front of your eyes.

278
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,780
It's incredible.

279
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,478
That's amazing.

280
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,020
Let's talk for a
little bit about how

281
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,197
generative AI has changed.

282
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,280
I mean, you've alluded
you're using generative AI.

283
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,803
And I can really imagine how
the vision models, for example,

284
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:14,220
like you have these vision
models that can look at a scene

285
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,520
and understand
where objects are.

286
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,020
Check.

287
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,980
Can you talk a little bit about
how generative AI has affected

288
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,920
other aspects of robotics, like
these manipulation questions?

289
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,380
I mean, has generative
AI had impact

290
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,840
in other areas or planning?

291
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,007
I mean, other areas as well?

292
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:32,028
I will say this.

293
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,570
Like I said, I know you're all
shocked because I said I was

294
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,690
programming in the '70s, and I
look so young, so I get that.

295
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,262
But I will say this.

296
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:43,170
I'd say generative AI is
probably the most impactful

297
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,970
technology that I've witnessed,
throughout my whole robotics

298
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,050
career.

299
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,418
And I tend to think
of it in three bins.

300
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:51,710
I'll just throw this out there.

301
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,040
I love being on campus again.

302
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,790
Again, it's great.

303
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,470
So maybe I'll get my academic
juices going again here.

304
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,870
Please no problem sets tonight.

305
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,050
Thanks.

306
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,990
I really think of it
in three categories.

307
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:10,330
There is, I would say, kind
of the collaborative AI,

308
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,490
language-based, language
in, language out,

309
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,050
help me summarize this
document, write for me

310
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,130
a prose that compares and
contrasts these thoughts.

311
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,930
That is language in, language
out, and that really--

312
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,570
we all should be
using those tools.

313
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,470
It just makes our
jobs that easier.

314
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,230
And we are right.

315
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,830
Then the next
bucket that I put is

316
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,470
kind of creative generative AI.

317
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,430
And this means that the
generative AI solution

318
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,830
is giving us designers
insight, and maybe

319
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,470
that we haven't had before.

320
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,590
So inside of Amazon,
I can give you

321
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,148
an example, a very
specific example,

322
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,690
is that we think
about process flows,

323
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,310
we think about material flow
throughout our buildings.

324
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,590
And this kind of creative--

325
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:08,550
we can ask our AWS-based
generative AI tool sets

326
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,110
to say, hey, could you
tell me a better way

327
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,550
that material should
flow, given all this data

328
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,450
that we've given you?

329
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,270
Where are the choke points?

330
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,070
And what our designers
see is they see something,

331
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,798
and it's never quite right.

332
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:24,090
It's not going to be perfect,
but it might inspire you.

333
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,210
That's not-- In no way
could I ever build that.

334
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,150
Yeah.

335
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,360
But they see--
they begin to see,

336
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,420
like oh, I didn't realize
that that is actually

337
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,660
the main choke point,
or I didn't really

338
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,460
realize that we had
that much volume

339
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,980
at this particular outbound dock
or this corner of the building.

340
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,428
And that insight gives them a
better way to design a solution.

341
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:48,220
Now it's their solution,
and then out comes

342
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,400
a new next-generation
fulfillment center.

343
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,900
Yeah.

344
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,540
OK.

345
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,660
Seeing that-- actually,
again, I think

346
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,860
I'm going back to my MIT days.

347
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,180
I was here on campus at the
Center for Space Research,

348
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:10,420
and we did an algorithm,
a genetic algorithm,

349
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,960
to design an antenna.

350
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,260
This is another good
bucket for this creative.

351
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,720
And it had many, many
generations of antenna.

352
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,860
And it ended up like
you could not physically

353
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,980
build the antenna--

354
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,720
like, you can't.

355
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,460
We didn't have any processes
to actually build that antenna.

356
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,770
But it gave our RF
engineers like, oh my gosh,

357
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,810
I see why it's working.

358
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,290
And he built this antenna
that we put on a spacecraft

359
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,990
and off it went,
which is awesome.

360
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,270
So that's the second bucket.

361
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,370
But the third bucket
is really where

362
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,630
I think there's a great
amount of challenge,

363
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:50,330
and I just call it
operational GenAI.

364
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,910
And I have examples of this.

365
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,770
So that fleet of bots
that are out there--

366
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,630
for example, we just announced
what we call DeepFleet,

367
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,250
and it's a generative AI
solution that is continuously

368
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,810
running to say, I know what
your algorithm is right now

369
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,589
that we've used for a decade.

370
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,089
I'm going to take that algorithm
in, and based on the data

371
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,839
that I'm seeing and
based on the real time

372
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,750
conditions of the
fleet right now,

373
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,710
I'm going to optimize
that a little bit better.

374
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,430
It's going to see the
patterns inside it,

375
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,138
and it's going to
suggest-- it's actually

376
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:22,869
going to generate,
purely on its own,

377
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,109
a better route for
one particular drive.

378
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,230
And it does that across
thousands of drives.

379
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,910
And then suddenly everything
is blended together.

380
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,890
We really like that.

381
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,330
We saw that this past year.

382
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,090
We just announced
this a few months ago,

383
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,090
and we're deploying it
across all of our fleets.

384
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:43,390
What it does is it gives us
a 10% efficiency in drive

385
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,312
time, and 10%--

386
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:46,270
It is a lot of dollars.

387
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,550
These buildings are 3
million square feet.

388
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,950
There's thousands and thousands
and thousands of drive units.

389
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,110
It's a really big deal.

390
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,390
When we put these together--

391
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,550
again, I want to just bring this
back to what our customer and

392
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,430
why this matters-- is you
put these systems together.

393
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,470
For example, we have our latest
generation of fulfillment center

394
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,150
in Shreveport--

395
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,650
2,500 new jobs we
put down there.

396
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,870
We're seeing that we can
process entire orders 25% faster

397
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,870
throughout that building.

398
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,973
We continue to hire, but we're
also seeing productivity gains.

399
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:26,140
We're seeing efficiency
gains and productivity gains

400
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,020
inside that
building, and we also

401
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,920
see the jobs changing inside
of that fulfillment center.

402
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,060
So again, very practical,
very real world,

403
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,340
and embedded into
the operation itself.

404
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,340
I'm wondering, Tye, if
you could talk a little--

405
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,740
as you're talking, I'm thinking
about this job question.

406
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,740
A lot of things that people
are worried about with AI

407
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,120
is it's going to replace people.

408
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,620
Yeah.

409
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,880
You're pretty far ahead, it
seems to me-- you're pretty--

410
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,380
this is--

411
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,130
I think that we're
pioneers in this field.

412
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,600
--a high degree of automation.

413
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,220
You've already deployed an
autonomous-- these robots

414
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,480
pretty extensively.

415
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,820
How has your human
workforce changed over

416
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,140
the years in terms of-- you talk
about numbers of people employed

417
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,260
in these fulfillment
centers or the types of jobs

418
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,890
that people are doing, or can
you talk about that a little.

419
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,390
Absolutely.

420
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,500
I can 100% talk about that
because I'm very proud of it.

421
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,260
When you give people the right
toolset, when you give people

422
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,020
a mindset of augmentation
and amplification

423
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,120
of their job, when
you can eliminate

424
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,940
the menial, the mundane, and the
repetitive out of people's jobs,

425
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,600
it frees them up a
bit, and it allows

426
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,360
them to focus on
higher order things.

427
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,100
It's a very hard job
to do that, by the way,

428
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,360
because if it's
not really useful

429
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,860
and you have a job to do--

430
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,360
Yeah.

431
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,763
You're going to
put it over here.

432
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,680
If it's really useful
and you have a job to do

433
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,400
and you're like, OK, I like
that, you as a designer

434
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,360
really need to pay
attention to the signals of,

435
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,060
what do you like about that,
and why is this useful to you?

436
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,660
All right.

437
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,080
So how jobs have changed
is that we're seeing,

438
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,720
and also I think we all have
a responsibility, especially

439
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,160
a large tech
company like Amazon,

440
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,500
to upskill our employees.

441
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,040
And we have put more than $1
billion into upskilling more

442
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,340
than 700,000 of our employees.

443
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,980
We have something
called career choice,

444
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,680
where right in our
fulfillment centers,

445
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,618
folks can learn
about AI systems,

446
00:20:14,618 --> 00:20:16,160
folks can learn
about robotics, folks

447
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,240
can learn-- they can
actually take any college

448
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,270
course that they want on it,
and we really believe in that.

449
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,590
We also believe
that, and we've seen

450
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,150
this where people,
when they're using it

451
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,073
as amplifiers in augmenting
their work, they really--

452
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:36,490
they like it, and they want
to be more involved with this.

453
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,790
So we have what we call
a robotics apprenticeship

454
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,927
program, very successful,
that we've rolled out

455
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,510
through our fulfillment
centers, where

456
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,850
if folks want to get
involved with robotics,

457
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,490
we will teach them
how to service them,

458
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,590
how to maintain them, what
to look out for example.

459
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,470
And we've seen a
pretty good increase

460
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,850
in the folks that
are doing that.

461
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,350
Why?

462
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,310
Well, first of all,
it's 40% more pay.

463
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,730
It's great pay.

464
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,990
Secondly, you're working
in the tech field,

465
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,550
and it's a great career.

466
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,042
So we're seeing that.

467
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:12,550
If you want to pop up
one level, my philosophy

468
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,450
is that we are
pioneers in this field.

469
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,190
We are pioneers when it comes
to collaborative robotics,

470
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,940
when it comes to building
machines that allow

471
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,920
folks to be more efficient.

472
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,560
And I say that because
we have a huge advantage.

473
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,940
We're in e-commerce.

474
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,700
We kind of invented this
goods-to-person fulfillment

475
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,820
strategy, and we have a
semi-structured environment.

476
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,540
More than 300 of
our buildings are

477
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,780
robotics, like what
you saw in the video--

478
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,340
robotics-enabled buildings.

479
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,020
It's a huge number.

480
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,860
And when we try something,
we think of something,

481
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,502
we convince ourselves
that this is

482
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:49,960
going to be good
for our employees,

483
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,840
it's going to create a safer
environment for our employees,

484
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,040
we will build it in the lab.

485
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,960
That's what we do.

486
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,790
That's cool.

487
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,040
But that's only the beginning.

488
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,415
You build it in
the lab, and then

489
00:21:57,415 --> 00:22:00,013
we'll take one quarter of
one building and one floor

490
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:01,680
and then try it in
the real environment,

491
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,888
and we'll see how that works.

492
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,060
And you iterate.

493
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,080
We iterate our AI systems.

494
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,000
We iterate the mechanics.

495
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,900
We iterate the robotics.

496
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,000
We listen to the
voice of the customer.

497
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,940
And what it does
is it allows you--

498
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,440
suddenly you're uncovering like,
oh, I didn't think of that.

499
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,565
Oh, I didn't think of that.

500
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:19,800
Oh, I didn't think of that one.

501
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,520
And then it gets better,
and then we get one floor.

502
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,108
OK, great.

503
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,900
And then we roll it
out and we're like, OK,

504
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,983
it's actually working now.

505
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,040
That's-- oh, wow.

506
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,940
Wow, OK.

507
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,500
It's good.

508
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,360
And then I usually look
for the big clue, which

509
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,420
is the general manager
of the building will say,

510
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,420
oh, no guys probably
shouldn't release that yet.

511
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm like, why?

512
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,100
Why is that?

513
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,660
Because they're
gaining efficiencies,

514
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,600
and compared to their
other general managers,

515
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,340
they're like, hey, I don't
whatever you guys have,

516
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,715
but I want that cup of coffee.

517
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:45,840
That one looks pretty good.

518
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,020
So then we roll it
out more generally.

519
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,680
Awesome.

520
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,020
Maybe let's turn to a little
bit sort of visionary here.

521
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,920
And hearing you
talk, you said it's

522
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,520
a semi-structured
environment, which

523
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,280
I take to mean you know the
floor plan of these buildings,

524
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,923
and you have to
watch out for people.

525
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:05,840
And sometimes there's
things that aren't where

526
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,757
you expect them to be.

527
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:11,080
But it's not like walking around
the MIT campus or something.

528
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,180
Yeah, and we've heard about
drone delivery or whatever,

529
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,770
but I'm wondering,
looking forward,

530
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,430
I mean, how far away are we
from the idea that I might have,

531
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,070
a robot that's like, Amazon
is delivering my packages

532
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,750
with a robot that rolls up to
my office or rolls up to my--

533
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,130
walks up my front steps
and drops my package off.

534
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,650
Is that going to happen soon?

535
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,590
I will say that we will innovate
in every way for our customers,

536
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,090
for sure.

537
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,350
I will tell you
that we are already

538
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,250
involved in the majority
of deliveries out there.

539
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,390
The robotics, GenAI,
machine learning-- we've

540
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,890
been doing machine
learning from the get-go,

541
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,670
if you think about the
product placement out there.

542
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:58,230
We're there, but
never satisfied.

543
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,590
We want to have the ultimate
in customer convenience, which

544
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,990
means the world's largest
selection of goods

545
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,290
at a low cost, delivered
right to the customer's door.

546
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,172
That's what we do.

547
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:09,130
That's just what we do.

548
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,797
That frames everything
that we do inside

549
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:12,220
of our robotics and automation.

550
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,740
And to do that, you
really need to understand

551
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,780
the scale at which we
operate and the pressure that

552
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,157
puts on a robotic system
that actually works.

553
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:27,240
It's not a YouTube moment.

554
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,200
It's not a backflip.

555
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,340
It's not parkour.

556
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,220
It is getting goods
to customer's door.

557
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,480
And that is in itself a
remarkable achievement.

558
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,020
And when you talk about
the vision that we have--

559
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,720
I genuinely believe
this, I really do.

560
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,540
This is why I'm so proud of the
women and men that work inside

561
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,400
of Amazon each and every day
on these really cutting edge,

562
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,260
whether it's the GenAI--

563
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,700
the new foundation
model that we have,

564
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,420
whether it's in the hardware
stack or the software stack,

565
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,060
that what we're doing
inside of e-commerce

566
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,240
through practical, everyday
applied robotics actually,

567
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,200
I believe, will start to
transcend into other sectors,

568
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,160
whether it's agriculture
or it's automotive

569
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,540
or it's in health care.

570
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,880
The basics of-- I
mean the basics--

571
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,820
moving stuff, manipulating
stuff, identifying stuff,

572
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,700
sorting stuff.

573
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,200
Those are the basics,
and we're just

574
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,720
starting to do that at scale
with reality, that now we're

575
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,000
going to go into other
sectors and then we

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,320
get the holy grail, the
part that really puts

577
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
a smile on my face, is
because then that's going

578
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,360
to start to work its way
into every home, every home

579
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,880
out there--

580
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,563
allowing people to focus
more on what matters,

581
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:41,980
allowing them to focus on their
loved ones in their house,

582
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,120
allowing them to do
other jobs and have all

583
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,420
the menial, mundane
stuff done for them.

584
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,080
We've seen Elon Musk, I
guess, kind of famously

585
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,080
say that bet on humanoid
robots and say Tesla

586
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,940
is going to be a--
whatever it is--

587
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,320
$25 trillion
company on the backs

588
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,500
of this humanoid robotic bet.

589
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,940
Would you bet on
humanoid robots,

590
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,240
or are you imagining
more in the home

591
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,040
that these kind of things
that we saw in your video

592
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,990
are more small-scale,
human-friendly things that

593
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,330
move stuff around for me?

594
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,970
Or like, what are your--

595
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,030
It's funny.

596
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,590
Again, I'm on campus, so
I'm inspired here, for sure.

597
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,248
First of all, we have millions
of robots already out there.

598
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,290
So it's not about this is
what we're going to do.

599
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,550
This is what we are doing.

600
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,175
And they have a very
practical purpose.

601
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,990
We always start--

602
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,310
I always start-- what problem
are you trying to solve?

603
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,860
First and foremost, what
problem are you trying to solve?

604
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,110
And I would say that to
everybody, every single person

605
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,390
out here, if you're thinking
about some technology,

606
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,350
you should start
with, what problem

607
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,802
are you trying to solve first?

608
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:46,510
Because if you're just
technology looking

609
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,802
for technology's sake and
how am I going to apply this,

610
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:50,672
it's not going to
work out so well.

611
00:26:50,672 --> 00:26:52,630
So start with what problem
I'm trying to solve.

612
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,350
From that, I generate function.

613
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,450
What functions will I need in
order to solve that problem?

614
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,450
It's not form but function.

615
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,150
So humanoid is a form.

616
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,265
If you start just
in the form and say,

617
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:07,640
I think you're
starting to fall--

618
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,840
you fall into this trap of,
OK, how can I apply this?

619
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,380
And there's a thought, and I
get it, and I understand it,

620
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,060
and I appreciate it, of well,
it's going to do everything.

621
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,840
It's going to be general.

622
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,540
You think of it
and it can do it.

623
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,460
Anything-- anything a person
can do, it can do better.

624
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,560
I don't believe in
that philosophy.

625
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,820
I believe that it's a system
of people and machines

626
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,640
working together.

627
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,420
We should have the
strengths of machines

628
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,660
doing repetitive motion,
lifting heavy objects,

629
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,660
calculating huge numbers
for us, understanding

630
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,800
where all our inventory is.

631
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,467
That's what machines
are really good at.

632
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:46,740
And let people have
common sense and use

633
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,260
their instincts and the
ability to problem solve

634
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,380
and understand the overall
flow of what happens,

635
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,060
and bring those
together in a smart way.

636
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,620
And at this conference, like
I'm very excited to be here

637
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,380
because to bring that
intuition and the common sense

638
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,600
in a human, relatable
way is where I think

639
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,160
that we need a lot of work.

640
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,600
I think that we
need a lot of work

641
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,200
there, not as a
combative or a versus

642
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,000
but as a collaborative, a
collaborative way, so that

643
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,260
allowing us to use
our machines better.

644
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,760
Cool.

645
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,160
Cool.

646
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,358
I'm wondering, let's just--

647
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:24,900
we got a minute and a half left,
so maybe I'll give you one--

648
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,920
That was fast.

649
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,680
I'll just ask you one question,
like, is this the good one?

650
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,895
Is this the good one?

651
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:33,020
Just zing me with this one.

652
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,700
I'm ready.

653
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,440
I'm prepared.

654
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,940
No, I don't think
I have a good one.

655
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm sorry.

656
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,220
All right.

657
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,680
Maybe just as you
think about-- there's

658
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,580
probably a bunch of MIT students
and researchers in the audience.

659
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,880
What would be the-- if
you could say, like here

660
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,800
are the three
things that we need

661
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,760
in robotics, what would be the
big breakthroughs that you would

662
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,160
want or you think are needed
before we get to this, whatever

663
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,440
it is, Elon Musk, and
do that in 55 seconds.

664
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:58,940
I'm ready.

665
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,440
All right.

666
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,240
You ready?

667
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,310
I'd say we need to
I would say much

668
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,630
more in human-machine
interaction--

669
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,510
more research there.

670
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,230
In the hardware
stack, I really think

671
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,150
that we need to break through in
low-power embedded, maybe even

672
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,710
neuromorphic, computing, so that
we can carry a little bit more

673
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,950
on the edge from the
hardware point of view.

674
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,990
And also the system point
of view, if it's humanoids

675
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,790
or if it's wheels or it's four
legs or it's one leg or six

676
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,670
or whatever, once
you get to a spot,

677
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,332
you then need to interact
with something, so I'm also--

678
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:34,790
I really love the
work that's being

679
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,190
done, particularly on campus
here, in dexterous manipulation.

680
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,370
That's my research.

681
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,190
If you gave me grand
challenges, they're

682
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,790
going to be very practical.

683
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,502
Do you see that laundry
basket over there?

684
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,210
You can imagine there's
a laundry basket.

685
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,110
I want you to do the laundry and
then put it into the drawers.

686
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,610
Yeah.

687
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,433
It's a ginormous challenge,
if you just think about it.

688
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:55,350
OK, that would be one.

689
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,990
Second-- shout out
to my MIT homies

690
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,723
out here, and John
Hao, Professor Hao,

691
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:03,890
if he's out there somewhere--
we thought of this one

692
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,970
together years ago.

693
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,130
Just take a robot and carry
a couple of Amazon packages

694
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,450
and go from the end of
the Infinite Corridor

695
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:17,270
all the way out to Kresge here
when we're changing classes.

696
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,603
That's all I'm asking you to do.

697
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:20,520
But just don't hit-- and
don't hit any people.

698
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,870
Don't hurt anybody on the way.

699
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,370
Yeah.

700
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,670
And make your way through
that little corridor.

701
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,750
I had a hard enough time
doing it as a student.

702
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,870
That's going to be
a really hard job.

703
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,912
That's a great one, yeah.

704
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,630
And then the third--

705
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,930
I love sports.

706
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:38,690
Red Sox are kind of eating it
a little bit, but just play

707
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,210
an entertaining
game of baseball.

708
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,545
Just entertaining.

709
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:45,170
That's awesome.

710
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:45,920
Just entertaining.

711
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,350
That would be my three
grand challenges.

712
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,710
So someone bust those out.

713
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,970
Please, please connect
with me on LinkedIn

714
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,890
if you have any solution
to any of those.

715
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,470
Sounds good.

716
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,390
Well, Tye, we're out of
time, but thank you so much.

717
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,310
Thank you.
It was really a pleasure.

718
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,630
Thank you.

719
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,130
Thank you.

720
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,420
Thanks, everybody.
