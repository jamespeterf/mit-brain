00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,880
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,800
Thank you for joining us
for our open conversation

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,880
with neuropsychologist and
lifelong learner, Bia Adams.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,400
Today, we'll talk about
the ways in which curiosity

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,080
and continuous learning can
transform personal growth

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,360
and mental well-being.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm Curt Newton, Director
of MIT OpenCourseWare.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,000
OpenCourseWare is a
free and open collection

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,360
of materials from
thousands of MIT courses

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,400
covering the entire
MIT curriculum.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,440
We create new
opportunities for millions

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,160
of learners and educators,
share open education resources

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,080
from MIT, and help lead a
global revolution in free access

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,200
to knowledge.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,500
This is the third event in
the Open Conversation series

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,040
which focuses on how
open learning can

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,510
empower people to improve
their lives, communities,

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,250
and the world.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,290
Our guest today is Bia Adams.

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,810
Bia has been on a fascinating
and inspiring journey.

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,810
From an initial degree and
work in clinical and behavioral

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,450
psychology, to dance with
the London Contemporary Dance

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,950
School and the Royal Ballet,
and then back to psychology,

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,890
extending into computational
neuroscience and related fields

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,290
with MIT Open
Learning resources.

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,570
Thank you, Bia, for
joining us today.

28
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,390
There's so much to get
to explore and share.

29
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,290
Really looking forward to it.

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,170
So, if we might begin with
your wonderful accomplishments,

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,032
academic and in
personal pursuits, Beah,

32
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:44,490
would you please
share with us some

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,530
of the themes and
throughlines in your career

34
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,010
and your personal growth
and how curiosity has

35
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,530
played a role in this journey?

36
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,310
Hi, Curt.

37
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,810
Hi, everyone.

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,920
Thank you for having me.

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,460
I'm so excited to
finally be here.

40
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,700
Yeah, a few things about myself.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,920
I'm a neuropsychologist,
as you said,

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,539
and I'm a former
professional dancer.

43
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,140
I'm also a lifelong
learning-- my career has

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,700
been built across
diverse experiences,

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,140
but I think I've always
retained an interest

46
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,980
in lifelong learning.

47
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,920
I like to say that if money
and jobs were not concepts,

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,700
I would happily be
a forever student.

49
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,200
I started dancing when I
was four, four and a half,

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,020
but I thought-- my
mum thought would

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,380
be just a few lessons
of ballet turned

52
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,300
into many years of dancing.

53
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,520
I spent most of my
childhood and teens dancing,

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,060
then I studied psychology,
clinical and cognitive.

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,040
I worked as a psychologist
for a few years.

56
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,400
Then in my mid-20s, I went
on an extended sabbatical

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,620
because I wanted to
explore dance a bit more

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,300
and I wanted to
perform a bit more.

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,040
So this time, I studied
contemporary dance

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,780
in London Contemporary
Dance School,

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,280
and I performed for a few years.

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,560
I also explored with
other movement practices.

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,980
I managed to get a
black belt in aikido.

64
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,160
I started skateboarding,
longboarding,

65
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,160
which, of course, led
to quite a few injuries.

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,680
Due to those, and also because
I really developed an interest

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,200
in the neuroscience
part of psychology,

68
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,680
I went back to psychology
and I resumed my studies,

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,640
and I eventually specialized
in medical neuroscience

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,560
and started working as a
neuropsychologist, which

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,960
is what I do now.

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,140
I still dance, albeit
not professionally,

73
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,770
but I do it regularly
and with much joy.

74
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:04,410
I discovered MIT OpenCourses
in 2022, it was, yes.

75
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,730
And I completed several
from various fields.

76
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,450
And I'm planning to actually
approach more in next year.

77
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,149
Other than that,
I'm multilingual.

78
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,330
I grew up speaking
several languages,

79
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,810
and then acquired more.

80
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,510
One of my project--

81
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,210
I mean, every five years I try
to approach a new language,

82
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,090
and I'm doing that
at the moment.

83
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,650
I find much--

84
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,370
I'm drawn, I'm curious
about how new languages work

85
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,570
and how structure
arises out of them.

86
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,930
Also, this year,
I finished writing

87
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,260
my first book of fiction,
to be released next year.

88
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,420
It's called Humans
After All, and if you

89
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,900
watch my online spaces, you will
see excerpts from it already,

90
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,700
and hopefully the
final result next year.

91
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,600
Yeah, you asked me
about curiosity.

92
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:13,260
I think curiosity has been
there throughout my development.

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,020
I've always been
drawn by movement

94
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,900
and interested in
movement, how it arises.

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,260
How our bodies move, why we
are able to do things and why

96
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,360
we are not able to do things.

97
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,560
So I think-- when I
started doing ballet,

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,340
I was drawn-- curiosity helped
me dissect movement, understand

99
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,940
technique, understand
timing, how

100
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,820
movement relates to music,
another big interest of mine.

101
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,190
Then also that the expression,
the possibilities of expression

102
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,630
that arise out of dignity,
not just the series of steps.

103
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,710
So what I didn't know
then, but I appreciate now

104
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,310
as a psychologist, is
that this curiosity I

105
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,470
had activated the dopaminergic
system in the brain, the reward

106
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,430
system.

107
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,770
That's something which
makes you go after things,

108
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,690
it opens the door to learning.

109
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,230
And it also makes you a bit
more cognitively flexible

110
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,230
so that you can
adapt to learning,

111
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,110
and through the connections
that the dopaminergic system has

112
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,270
with the hippocampus, to
consolidate what you've learned.

113
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,150
So I didn't know then
that I was actually

114
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,390
priming my brain for deep
learning without even

115
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,990
knowing what deep learning was.

116
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,570
Later on when I transitioned
to neuroscience,

117
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:54,610
I think curiosity served
almost a protective--

118
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,250
almost had a protective
role because instead

119
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,370
of interpreting this
change as change in career,

120
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,610
almost in identity,
I looked at it

121
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,230
as an opportunity to
explore something new,

122
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,410
explore something meaningful.

123
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,330
And I think that's
important in periods

124
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,810
when you that we
associate with identity.

125
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,190
I was a dancer, and then
I became a scientist.

126
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,330
So instead of interpreting
this change as a threat,

127
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,850
I try to look at it through
the eyes of the explorer.

128
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,130
What could come out of this?

129
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,730
And I think that reframes
uncertainty and reframes

130
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:49,360
ambiguity, which our brains are
not very good at tolerating.

131
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,140
Does that answer your question?

132
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,980
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:00,860
That spirit of exploration is so
fundamental to what we can get

134
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,380
up to, and it's-- thank
you for sharing that path.

135
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,900
Yeah.

136
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,660
I mean, I would
share that what we've

137
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,140
learned about the people who
use MIT OpenCourseWare more

138
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,140
broadly from around
the world, they're

139
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,080
coming from a lot of
different positions.

140
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,340
Some of them are enrolled
students, some of them

141
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,300
are educators
trying to figure out

142
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,460
how to teach more effectively.

143
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,559
Many of them are just
curious, independent learners.

144
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,120
And what we've heard from
everyone across the board,

145
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,940
that the number one
reason why they're

146
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,550
coming to these resources
is because they have

147
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,410
this fundamental curiosity.

148
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,090
And there's often other
reasons beyond that,

149
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,550
but it's just really interesting
that that force is out there

150
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,730
so widely reflected, and you've
definitely been living it,

151
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,970
so thank you, yeah.

152
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,750
Well, curiosity, if we
look at the way curiosity

153
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,870
arises in the brain, I think
that will probably just answer

154
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,630
your curiosity and your
question a bit more.

155
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,870
We become more curious when our
brains detect an information

156
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,870
gap.

157
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,310
When we sense that there's
something we don't know,

158
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,230
but we could know; that there's
something we don't fully

159
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,070
understand, but we
could understand;

160
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,470
and when the brain
detects this gap,

161
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,550
it sets in motion the
same dopaminergic system

162
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:41,560
I mentioned earlier
that, in turn,

163
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,960
prepares the
neurochemical milieu,

164
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,880
the dopamine required
to create the motivation

165
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,560
to go out there, seek
the missing information,

166
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,760
and close the gap.

167
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,440
And it's exactly this
exploratory behavior

168
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,540
that we mentioned earlier.

169
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,680
So most-- I'm quite confident
that a lot of learners

170
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,180
already have some knowledge
from certain fields,

171
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,060
but there's that
information gap.

172
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,240
That's something they wish they
would know more of and more

173
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,400
from, and that once they find
the platform, once they find

174
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,720
the source of knowledge,
they seize it because that's

175
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,880
what the brain does.

176
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,520
They have all the support,
the neurobiological support

177
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,680
to do that.

178
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,200
Yeah.

179
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,260
And it never stops.

180
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,740
Those questions, that
sense of, oh, here's a gap,

181
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,380
here's a new thing,
we certainly feel

182
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,780
that when we're young all the
time, but also, it never stops.

183
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,020
And so to be able
to support people

184
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:53,220
at every age of life, continuing
to explore that stuff, as you've

185
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,920
been doing, feels just really,
really important and useful,

186
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,140
yeah.

187
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,940
It's self-replenishing,
I would say.

188
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,540
It never stops-- once you find
an answer to one question,

189
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,680
another one arises.

190
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,460
So I totally agree.

191
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,400
And that's actually an
important thing to note.

192
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,800
Curiosity and motivation,
they're not personality traits.

193
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,220
You're not born with
them and they stay rigid

194
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,560
for the rest of their life.

195
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,440
They are practice.

196
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,700
They are tools and
facets of one's behavior

197
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,740
that need constant practice.

198
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,640
And the more you practice, the
more will come out of them.

199
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,100
So yeah, I agree.

200
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,555
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:44,310
I wonder if you have
a perspective on how

202
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:51,590
living a life of curiosity
supports one's broader

203
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,970
sense of well-being and
connection in the world.

204
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,030
Through your own
experience or the work that

205
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,670
you're doing with people,
what have you seen about that?

206
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,190
Well, curiosity, per se, the
act of engaging curiosity

207
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,890
and motivation to engage in
new pursuits-- and mind you,

208
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,350
when I say learning, the
curiosity to learn something new

209
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,210
and the motivation to
learn something new,

210
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,090
I don't mean just
abstract stuff.

211
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,910
Actually, it's preferred, from
a neuroscientific point of view,

212
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,670
for it to be multimodal.

213
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,430
Cognitive, motor,
social, emotional,

214
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,950
because it recruits
more areas of the brain,

215
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,240
going by the same principle
of lose it or use it--

216
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,920
or use it or lose it.

217
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,260
So maintaining a curious
approach to life,

218
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,400
maintaining curiosity in
engaging with new learning

219
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,960
material, with
lifelong learning,

220
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,120
has quite a few benefits, and
mainly why it is important.

221
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,940
It's because it literally
changes the brain.

222
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,020
It drives what we
call neuroplasticity.

223
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,880
Neuroplasticity is
the brain's ability

224
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,360
to change itself in
response to experience,

225
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,720
in response to new learning.

226
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:21,080
So curiosity-- applied
curiosity in new learning

227
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,800
rewires the brain to
form new circuits.

228
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,200
You allow for neurogenesis,
the formation of--

229
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,640
the genesis of new
neurons in some areas

230
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,760
of the brain, particularly
the hippocampus.

231
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,450
It also acts as a
protective buffer

232
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,730
against age-related
cognitive decline.

233
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,450
It slows down-- it lowers
the incidence of dementia.

234
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,370
Let us not forget
the social benefits

235
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,530
that come with being curious
and engaging in new pursuits

236
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,230
with others.

237
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,770
Just the act of doing
something with others,

238
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,170
of proving oneself to be
capable of being competent,

239
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,130
the feeling of self-efficacy, of
mastery, they build confidence.

240
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,050
And all these things are proven
to reduce symptoms of anxiety

241
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,570
and depression and isolation.

242
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:25,890
Also, when you see a
curiosity, neuroscience

243
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:31,510
shows us that when
curiosity is high, yeah,

244
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:37,990
our brains switch from networks
that preferentially process

245
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,310
threat to networks that
allow for exploration

246
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,030
for curious approach, for
going out and exploring

247
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,430
one's territory.

248
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,390
That also goes hand-in-hand
with-- let's call

249
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,050
it cognitive flexibility.

250
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,710
With the ability to
reappraise a situation

251
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,870
not in terms of threat, but
in terms of exploration.

252
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,530
So maintaining this
mindset of what else--

253
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,510
how else could I
look at a situation?

254
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,630
What else is there to
find out about this?

255
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,630
How can I look at this from
a different perspective?

256
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,030
Or then, what else is there
that I feel I could know,

257
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,830
but I don't?

258
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,210
I don't yet understand,
but I know I could?

259
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,850
The missing puzzle,
how do I find it?

260
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,920
The brain loves puzzles.

261
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,760
The fact that a sense of
curiosity, it helps us,

262
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,980
like I said before, reframe
uncertainty, but it also--

263
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,560

264
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,520
it also puts us in a
situation where we also

265
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,360
become more resilient.

266
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,800
We allow for the
brain's instances

267
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:07,040
of cognitive reappraisal
and reframing of a situation

268
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,920
to work so that we have
a better stress response.

269
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,600
The less-- the better
decision-making.

270
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,160
The impact of stress
on emotional circuits

271
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,080
in the limbic system is reduced.

272
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,180
So curiosity is not just
learning new material,

273
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,890
it actually impacts mental
health and resilience long-term.

274
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,770
Yeah.

275
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,190
I love hearing that reflection.

276
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,170
We at OpenCourseWare,
at Open Learning,

277
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,090
we hear from so many
people around the world

278
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,290
that they've been able to
make use of our resources

279
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,050
when they are living in
various disrupted situations

280
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,830
in their lives.

281
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,290
I mean, lives are complicated,
and having these materials

282
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,130
shared openly and freely
with the world, clearly

283
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,390
people's lives have
some stresses in them.

284
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,950
But they're able to tap
into some foundational,

285
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,290
I guess, curiosities to,
despite or working through,

286
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,530
with resilience,
those disruptions,

287
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,750
continue to keep learning.

288
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,170
And we love hearing the
stories reporting back

289
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,150
about how they continue to
be able to keep learning.

290
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,885

291
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:28,820
People-- I'm remembering--
at OpenCourseWare,

292
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,920
we have this Chalk
Radio podcast,

293
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,500
and we just did a
series of hearing

294
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,080
from learners around the world.

295
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,260
Specifically, we heard a story
from a person named Lotfullah

296
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,300
in Afghanistan who was
living in a situation

297
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,780
where-- could not count
on having internet access

298
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,700
from day to day,
from hour to hour,

299
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,440
and all sorts of
other disruptions.

300
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,540
But were able to make
use of the materials

301
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,460
that we've shared
to keep learning

302
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,660
and how just vitally
useful that that was.

303
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,940
We hear those stories
again and again.

304
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,900
So it does seem to switch
something for people,

305
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,040
and really glad that we
can help support that.

306
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,540
Yeah.

307
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,660
And it's the
occurrence of what you

308
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,260
said, is supported by very
clearly defined structures

309
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,940
in the brain.

310
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,860
And again, it's,
again, the midbrain,

311
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,800
the dopaminergic
subsystem in the midbrain,

312
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,820
mainly the ventral tegmental
area and the nucleus accumbens,

313
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,140
which allow for this
sense of purpose,

314
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,680
for this sense of the micro-wins
of maybe understanding it

315
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,900
doesn't have to be the big
goal and the big monster.

316
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,040
It can be the small gremlin
that you finally tame

317
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,640
and you learn how to deal with,
but it's those micro-wins, those

318
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,880
that feeling of process that
I may not have understood

319
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,980
the full thing, but at
least I've got this much,

320
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,880
I mastered this much,
and maybe tomorrow, I'll

321
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,320
make sense of the next
bit, and next week I'll

322
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,220
make this make sense
of the next bit.

323
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,060
And that gives a
sense of progress,

324
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,640
but also of purpose, of
goal-directed behavior, which,

325
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,200
in times of hardship, in
times of duress and distress,

326
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,420
is what keeps you going.

327
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,410
And it could be as little as--

328
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,490

329
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,470
I said, it doesn't
have to be abstract.

330
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,690
It can be learning how
to play a new instrument

331
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,290
or learning how to-- that's
not a small thing-- learning

332
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,190
how to code.

333
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,650
I've actually approached
Ana Bell's code--

334
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,690
AI and computer science course,
so it reminds me of that.

335
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,010
So, yeah, maybe it has
even a stronger impact

336
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,090
on people who go
through difficult times

337
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,490
because, again, it
gives you that something

338
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,510
to look forward to.

339
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,370
That's something to
mobilize your resources

340
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,890
towards which is so
important in staving off--

341
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,010
in staunching symptoms
of hopelessness, which

342
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,690
are very closely
linked with depression,

343
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,390
and crippling anxiety.

344
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,290
So yeah, I completely
agree with you.

345
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:14,790
Yeah.

346
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,050
Yeah, what I'm hearing
in your description

347
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,620
is this process of building
confidence bit by bit, too.

348
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,642
You start from a place
of realizing, hey,

349
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,100
there's something
that I don't know

350
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,080
that I'm curious about and
building that confidence.

351
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,610
That confidence can be really
infectious in a good way, yeah?

352
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,110
Yeah.

353
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,320
No, you're spot-on.

354
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,280
Now that I told
you, I'm learning--

355
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,040
I'm approaching
foreign languages,

356
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,720
and I was saying to my friend,
when I sit down to relearn--

357
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,380
I call it relearning Hebrew
because I sort of knew something

358
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,420
from before, and I'm drawn to
it because it forces my brain

359
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,400
to do things counterintuitively.

360
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,040
The same way I experienced
with when I started aikido,

361
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,780
it's against the way
my brain would do it.

362
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,260
Not only is it a right
to left, but it's

363
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,160
a whole different
grammar structure.

364
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,980
So it puts me in a
situation of discomfort.

365
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,180
So I'm sometimes overwhelmed.

366
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,600
I don't know whether I'll
be able to make sense of it,

367
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,130
but the micro--
there are micro-wins.

368
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,090
If I manage to
understand this much,

369
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,750
then the next day I'll sit
down and say, OK, let's see

370
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,910
what happens--

371
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,130
let's see what happens today.

372
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,430
Let's see what I
make sense of today.

373
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,990
So I become a bit more
confident because it's

374
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,150
yet another small milestone
that I've conquered.

375
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,030
I'm this much closer to
something which I don't even

376
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,410
know where it is in
time and in space,

377
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,470
but I become more confident.

378
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:54,290
And that takes me back to when
I retrained in neuropsychology.

379
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,850
I remember I had to learn
a lot of neuroanatomy,

380
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,230
neurophysiology, diagnostics.

381
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,050
And it was-- oftentimes,
it was quite intimidating,

382
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,230
it was overwhelming.

383
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,430
But even those small
win of understanding

384
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,550
how cranial nerves work,
or finding the acronym

385
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,930
to remember something, or
nailing a small differential

386
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,930
diagnosis, that not
only did it make

387
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,490
me happy through the
same reward circuitry,

388
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:32,450
but it boosted my motivation,
the big M word, to carry on.

389
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,850
So it actually kept me on track.

390
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,850
Otherwise, perhaps I
would have given up

391
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,610
if I looked at this whole
chunk as, oh God, here's

392
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,630
the big monster.

393
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,890
So I agree with you,
building confidence slowly

394
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,970
is definitely
something that we see

395
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,310
with lifelong learners, people
who engage in lifelong learning.

396
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,170
Yeah, yeah.

397
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,550
This brings to mind stories that
we hear from so many people,

398
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,110
especially older learners.

399
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,250
I think there's a
way in which we're

400
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,530
conditioned as older
people to think

401
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,870
we're supposed to know stuff.

402
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,370
Yeah.

403
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,370
And that moving into
that space of not knowing

404
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,020
can be uncomfortable, but
we hear from so many people,

405
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,500
I studied this
subject back in school

406
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,940
and it didn't make sense
to me, and suddenly,

407
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,840
thank you, OpenCourseWare,
for instance,

408
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
for giving me this
alternate explanation.

409
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,100
Suddenly now I understand,
I've recovered that sense of,

410
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,340
yeah, I can come back to this
and take another try at it,

411
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,620
and just how
transformative that can

412
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,940
be for people no matter what
stage in life they're at.

413
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,660
Absolutely.

414
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,800
It also-- I would like to
say this tongue-in-cheek,

415
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,580
that it stops you--
it prevents one

416
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,390
from taking oneself
too seriously.

417
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,180
Keeping humble.

418
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,700
A lot of us,
especially if there's

419
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,362
something we become
good at, hopefully, we

420
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:01,820
tend to think that we know the
answers to all the questions

421
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,180
or what we know is
enough, but it's always

422
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,740
good to have this reality
check that there's something

423
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,340
there we don't know or there may
be another way to look at it.

424
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,110
And that, again, takes us
back to cognitive flexibility.

425
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,150
It's something that tends to--

426
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,790
because of how brain
function declines

427
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,430
physiologically,
cognitive flexibility,

428
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,130
fluidity of thinking and
of appraising reality

429
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,550
and what's being internalized
as knowledge is a bit lost.

430
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,730
So working on that wiring
through lifelong learning,

431
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,910
through complex work,
through, like you said,

432
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,710
learning new things or
revisiting new things

433
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,950
through mentally
stimulating hobbies,

434
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,990
it allows for the looseness of
that circuitry to be maintained.

435
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:04,270
And also for the distance
from yourself that sometimes

436
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,990
is needed to just be
able to learn new things

437
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,170
and to look at the world
with different eyes.

438
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:17,260
It's a humble thing to be
able to do that later in life.

439
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah.

440
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,520

441
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,000
Do you ever have people who
have learned about your story

442
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,320
say something like, I just
don't know how I would have time

443
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,860
to learn all of these things.

444
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,112
How do you find the time?

445
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:33,320
How do you create that space?

446
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,000
I get that in the sauna, I
get that at work, I get that--

447
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,520
I get that.

448
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,120
And my answer is,
how do you know--

449
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,040
and I actually
get that question.

450
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,680
My answer is usually,
well, I'm old,

451
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,160
so I've had time to
do all those things.

452
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,020
That's usually my go-to
get-out-of-jail-free card.

453
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,820
I usually say, well, I'm old,
I've been around since forever.

454
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,440
I've had time to
do these things.

455
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,640
But then maybe the more complex,
less tongue-in-cheek answer

456
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:18,460
would be I really
enjoyed what I did.

457
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,740
I never-- even now,
people say, well, why do

458
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,880
you swim five days a week?

459
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm like, I actually
enjoy doing it.

460
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,860
It's not something--
it's not an ordeal.

461
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,620
Most of the things
I've done I've

462
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,200
done because I was
really drawn to them.

463
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,620
So for me, it's a joy.

464
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,300
This is joy.

465
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,280
I mean, there are clearly things
that I would rather not do

466
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,820
and they're there just
to maintain something.

467
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,420
Having to do strength in
order to maintain flexibility.

468
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,200
But I actually-- like you
said, it's self-replenishing,

469
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,800
it's self-perpetuating.

470
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,460
Like now, I can't stop
learning this foreign language.

471
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,860
Actually, I wake up
and I think, maybe

472
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,260
I want to make sense of that.

473
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,780
So I think it's
just-- it's something

474
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,200
that I was encouraged to do.

475
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,250
Also, I had good parental
encouragement growing up,

476
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,190
and luckily I had the
context and the environment

477
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,030
to pursue some interests.

478
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,650
And I maintained, like
I said, this practice.

479
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:29,230
I maintained the curiosity
and the motivation, and also

480
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,270
the discipline, which deserves
another conversation altogether,

481
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,130
to do these things.

482
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,550
And then, to
complete the answer,

483
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,990
they've brought me enough
reward to keep me going.

484
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,730
It was not something I did
just for the sake of doing.

485
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,110
I got a lot out of it
enough to keep going.

486
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,630
Yeah.

487
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,130
Yeah.

488
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,070

489
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,030
Curious to hear a little bit
more maybe about your sense

490
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:07,160
of the social aspects of
being a lifelong learner.

491
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,680
In addition to all the
things that we individually

492
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,440
are drawn into, how have
you experienced in your life

493
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,520
sharing it with other
people or bringing

494
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,863
other people into these
journeys, and things

495
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:25,280
you might want to
share with share

496
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,860
with our viewers about that?

497
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,000

498
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,300
Well, you hit the
nail on the head,

499
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,520
it's like you read my mind.

500
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,300
I actually meant to bring
this into the conversation.

501
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,880

502
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,240
And maybe part of it I
discuss a fiction context

503
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,240
in this book I've
finished writing, how

504
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,100
important the social dimension
of learning is in general,

505
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,520
and also how important
it's been for me.

506
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,200
And how intrinsic it is to
sometimes just stay on track

507
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,490
and to maintain the
motivation to keep going.

508
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,250
And it's something which
is perhaps slightly waning

509
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,370
in the modern world.

510
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,810
The act of learning with others,
the act of sharing knowledge

511
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,290
with others--

512
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,690
we're in this together.

513
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,970
As hard as it gets, we're
learning this together,

514
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,970
or we're learning
from each other,

515
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,390
to me, has been very important.

516
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,330
Although, in terms of
personality, maybe,

517
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,130
I actually prefer,
especially when

518
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,210
it comes to abstract
knowledge, to learn alone.

519
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,390
But then I like to share.

520
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:45,610
I like to have somebody to
have shared reflection with.

521
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,550
And it also helps
with accountability.

522
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:53,330
I remember-- it could
be a discussion forum,

523
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,030
but learning with
somebody else--

524
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,570
a study buddy, right?

525
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,790
Preferably a human
study buddy helps with--

526
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,590
I've already mentioned
accountability comprehension

527
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,890
and sharing understanding
of material.

528
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,270
But what it also does, I've
noticed, especially when you

529
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,950
study something which
is hard, and there

530
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:24,350
are obstacles along
the way and fatigue

531
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,710
rears its ugly head,
having a study buddy

532
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,950
helps with eliminating
or reducing

533
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,190
the sense of isolation
that can come out

534
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,910
of months and months of
being engaged in hard study.

535
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,990
And sometimes it's
that sense of isolation

536
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,270
that can halt progress.

537
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:50,950
So to me, it's been important
to have somebody to--

538
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,690
when it came to
academic pursuits,

539
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,590
it was important
to have somebody

540
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,670
to even meet and have a
conversation about tomorrow's

541
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,660
exam or what had to be studied.

542
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,860
I was lucky to have a
good friend in university

543
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,820
and I'm forever grateful to
her for being my study buddy--

544
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,840
human study buddy.

545
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,560
And when it comes to other types
of learning, of course, just

546
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,040
sharing the fact
that-- let me show you

547
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,520
how I learned to play guitar,
or you show me this dance piece

548
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,000
and I'll try to copy you, it
creates a sense of cohesion,

549
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,900
and also a sense of mastery.

550
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,500
Like I've mentioned before,
a sense of efficacy.

551
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,520
I'm showing you that
I'm good at this.

552
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:43,140
I'm showing you that I'm
competent enough to do this.

553
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,980
And then there's the feedback
that comes back to me

554
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,920
and I feel competent.

555
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,960
Through those same social
reward and the circuitry

556
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,610
that supports it is
back-mirrored to me,

557
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,670
and in turn, I feel
more competent,

558
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,950
that's extremely important.

559
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,850
And again, it helps with
resilience, with grit.

560
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:13,250
So social learning, I
couldn't encourage it more.

561
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:20,130
And I think learning, per
se-- we've already said,

562
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,710
all the-- we've already
outlined the benefits,

563
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,530
the lifelong benefits that
come with just being engaged

564
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,250
in learning, but
there's also the aspect

565
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:36,700
of-- if we were to visualize
this, a sort of visual vignette,

566
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,070
have this learning window
or door, let's call it,

567
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,730
and you have curiosity
and motivation

568
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,370
which help you take the
first steps through.

569
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,810
Good job, I didn't say window.

570
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,890
So you take the first step
through the learning door.

571
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,770
And then you have the
discipline and the rigor

572
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,060
and the structure which
keep you on track.

573
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,860
But then I think you also
need a sense of community

574
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,740
to anchor you into something
which hopefully will

575
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,740
become larger than yourself.

576
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:16,740
So I couldn't stress more the
benefits of social learning

577
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,520
and just doing it
with other humans.

578
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,020
Yeah.

579
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,340
Thanks, thanks.

580
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,960
Yeah, it makes me think of
MIT's motto, Mind and Hand.

581
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,160
There's the learning part of
it, the intellectual part of it.

582
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,520
But the hand part, the doing,
in particular, I think,

583
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,400
has this way of just bringing
other people into the process.

584
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,640
We demonstrate the things that
we're learning through the hand,

585
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,860
through the activities
out in the world.

586
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:51,020
We're creating opportunities
to engage with other people.

587
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,720
I know in my personal life,
I've been on a learning journey

588
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,160
for over a decade
about climate change

589
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,880
and how to respond to these
intersecting challenges

590
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,120
and the things that it
calls me into to share

591
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,960
my learnings have
to do with how do we

592
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,800
show up for civic
engagement as a citizen?

593
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,480
How to get engaged there.

594
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,400
So there's this
continuous feedback loop

595
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,320
between learning new things
and showing up in social spaces

596
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,100
to both demonstrate
what I've learned,

597
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,320
but also ask those questions
that are still ringing that

598
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,440
lead me into the next thing.

599
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,620
I'll also note, it's not
part of MIT's official motto,

600
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,320
but informally, Mind,
Hand, and Heart, showing up

601
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,600
for all of with our full selves
is really important part of it

602
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,199
as well.

603
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,090
I think of the heart part
of it is very connected

604
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,950
with that feeling of curiosity.

605
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,250
What is it that spark
or that small flame

606
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,410
that opens up as
the heart piece.

607
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,070
So, yeah, just a joy riffing
on that for a moment, yeah.

608
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,570
Yeah.

609
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,950
Yeah-- no, I totally agree.

610
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:19,530
And I absolutely
love MIT's motto.

611
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:27,130
Maybe I mentioned earlier, this
aspect of embodied cognition.

612
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,170
And I touched on it
briefly earlier when I--

613
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,490
and when I mentioned
multimodal learning and just

614
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:42,130
learning through all modalities,
which is actually preferred.

615
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,750
The brain likes that because
it recruits more areas.

616
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,260
It allocates more resources
from various bits.

617
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:58,380
And it's also-- it's been quite
the buzzword in the last few

618
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,660
years, embodied
cognition, and how--

619
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,060
because there's both
top-down regulation

620
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,000
of processes and bottom-up.

621
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,180
It's not just the brain
dictating everything

622
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,240
into the body.

623
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,660
It actually-- what happens and
how emotion and behavior arises

624
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,040
is both top-down and bottom-up.

625
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,580
What comes through
the senses, what

626
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,060
comes from the outside
going all the way up

627
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,900
into the higher instances of
the brain, and top-down as well.

628
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,180
So I'm happy you touched
on that because it's linked

629
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,600
with, as I said, this buzzword.

630
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,100
Yeah.

631
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,480
Embodied cognition.

632
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,280
And if I may, reflecting on
the social aspect of this,

634
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,980
we're so grateful
for all of the people

635
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,260
who are watching our livestream
right now and who registered.

636
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,190
And we got so many questions
from people about the broader

637
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,770
themes that we'd be
talking about today.

638
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,430
Maybe I'll turn some
of our attention

639
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,070
to what we've heard from
those questions here.

640
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,910
I think we've got over 100
questions that were submitted,

641
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,550
and our team has done
some valiant work

642
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:14,430
trying to group these into
some themes that people out

643
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,950
in the world are
wondering about,

644
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,830
especially around curiosity.

645
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:23,390
So, here's this first one.

646
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:27,390
Do you think curiosity
is a learnable skill?

647
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,190
And if so, what strategies might
help individuals and communities

648
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:38,990
to develop and reinforce
and carry it forward?

649
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,670
Curiosity, we've said, is--

650
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,070
let me think about the question.

651
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,950
So is curiosity learnable?

652
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,170
Or can it be developed, maybe?

653
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,710
Can it be enhanced, right?

654
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,730
So straight off
the bat, there are

655
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,770
no chemical--
pharmacological stimulants

656
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:01,250
that could enhance or
create curiosity, at least

657
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,570
not in a healthy way.

658
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:08,450
But there are cognitive
and emotional conditions

659
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,330
that we could create
to enhance curiosity.

660
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,110
Well, this question,
actually a very good one,

661
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,290
takes me back to what
we mentioned earlier,

662
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:23,890
about curiosity arising when the
brain detects this information

663
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,430
gap.

664
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,310
So why do we become curious?

665
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,630
Because we know that there's
something we don't yet know

666
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,210
or we can't yet do or we don't
yet understand, but we could.

667
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:39,290
So the brain sets in motion
its tried-and-tested ways

668
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:44,170
to make us motivated to go
out there and find the missing

669
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,100
piece in the puzzle.

670
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,940
So how could we
create the context

671
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,080
in which curiosity piques?

672
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,540

673
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,380
I've noticed, both in
dance and neuroscience,

674
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,240
that-- but mainly neuroscience
has confirmed this,

675
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,020
that the human brain likes,
and at the same time,

676
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,740
hates incomplete puzzles.

677
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,080
And that's tied in with
the information gap.

678
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,860
When the brain detects that
there's a missing puzzle,

679
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,400
it will increase motivation
to go out there and find it.

680
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,960
We like to find
the missing gaps.

681
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,860
So sometimes if we frame
the learning material

682
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,940
and the question in
such a way that we

683
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,380
sense that there's
something we don't yet know,

684
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,860
our brains will do
what needs to be

685
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,440
done to put us in the situation
where we can go out and find

686
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,980
the missing piece.

687
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,910
So that's usually a strategy.

688
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,670
Then novelty.

689
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,370
Novelty is-- bringing new
things into our reality,

690
00:39:54,370 --> 00:40:00,410
into our environment
can spike curiosity.

691
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,710
The brain loves novelty.

692
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:09,070
New perspectives, new ways of
looking at the world, new tools.

693
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,010
New tools are great.

694
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,590
Like, how do I use this?

695
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,830
New angles into a problem.

696
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:24,790
That's what-- novelty
spikes curiosity.

697
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,750
Also, that gets me
thinking about something

698
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,430
that a friend of mine
mentioned the other day, Tim.

699
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:37,030
He said that he feels more
curious and more motivated to do

700
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,760
things and also performs
better when he feels free,

701
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,520
or I would say--

702
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,720
I would say autonomous.

703
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,760
Yeah, and just to get
my disclaimer in early,

704
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,380
by autonomous, I don't
mean anarchy by autonomy.

705
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:57,360
I mean the freedom to explore,
to sometimes choose the question

706
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:03,640
rather than engaging in the
type of learning where you just

707
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,300
have to learn a given
material all the time.

708
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,080
The sense of agency,
the sense of,

709
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,900
I'm the one who does
the exploration,

710
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,100
and sometimes, if we
don't choose the answer,

711
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,760
we at least choose the question.

712
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,080
Also feeling the sense of
sometimes feeling safe,

713
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,280
maybe that's the word,
and I will explain.

714
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,520
The sense of that low stake.

715
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,060
Not always engaging in a
high-stakes environment.

716
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,600
Not that the environment--
it's not that they're bad

717
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,540
and they're not conducive
to progress or mastery

718
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,660
or competence, but because
the constant involvement

719
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,420
in a high-stake, slightly
threatening environment

720
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,380
dampens curiosity.

721
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,180
As we've said before,
curiosity spikes

722
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,380
when the brain shifts from
threat perception networks

723
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,700
to exploratory networks.

724
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,300
So sometimes feeling a bit
looser, a bit more comfortable

725
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,700
in an environment
with lower stakes

726
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,540
can set off
exploratory behavior.

727
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:17,220
If we're constantly engaged
in learning activities that

728
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,220
titillate the brain's
defense mechanisms,

729
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,740
we tend to become less
curious, and then motivation

730
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,140
goes down a bit.

731
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:32,580
So to answer the question, look
for puzzles, incomplete puzzles.

732
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,140
Novelty, autonomy to explore.

733
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,030
And then find environments
where you feel looser,

734
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,110
not constantly judged,
not constantly evaluated

735
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,970
and stuck labels on.

736
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:50,230
I think that helps with
long-term sustainment and--

737
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:54,870
sustainment and
enhancing of curiosity,

738
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,690
and the motivation
to back it up.

739
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,470
Yeah, good.

740
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,430
Yeah.

741
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,150
It leads me to another
set of questions

742
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,550
we got from some folks,
which I will summarize,

743
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,950
is while we've been singing
curiosity's praises,

744
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:16,190
are there ways in which
one might be too curious?

745
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,630
Are there ways
that we might want

746
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,150
to think about
managing that curiosity

747
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:28,950
to particular ends versus just
welcoming it with open arms--

748
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,430
OK, that's an interesting
question, becoming too curious,

749
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:37,380
as in dabbling into an
excessive number of interests.

750
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,800
Yeah, well, I think
we can interpret it--

751
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,000
you were talking about novelty
and how novelty is-- the brain

752
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,900
loves novelty.

753
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,400
I assume--

754
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,108
No, you're right.

755
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:47,880
The brain-- yeah.

756
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,180
No, you're totally right.

757
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,080
The brain loves
novelty, but if there's

758
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,400
one thing that the brain can't
do, as much as we would like

759
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,680
to think that and as much
biohackers promise us,

760
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,860
the brain can't process
unlimited input.

761
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,180
Yeah.

762
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,920
Right?

763
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,700
Cognitive fatigue
is a real thing,

764
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,720
and it's mainly due to the
prefrontal cortex, which

765
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,160
sits just here
below the forehead,

766
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,940
being metabolically extremely
costly, and fatigues easily,

767
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,440
and performance goes down.

768
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,480
So if becoming too curious
about too many things

769
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,650
at one specific time leads
to cognitive overload,

770
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:40,850
then you have a problem
because there's mental clutter.

771
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,710
You won't see clearly.

772
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,870
You won't see as clearly.

773
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,130
The brain's analytical
instances won't

774
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,810
be as well-equipped
to, one, comprehend

775
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,170
and make sense of
what's being learned.

776
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,310
To also evaluate evidence.

777
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:01,610
If it's something that requires
seeking truth or figuring out

778
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:04,030
whether trying to
make sense of things,

779
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:09,250
that mental clutter,
that prefrontal fatigue,

780
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:14,410
prefrontal fatigue actually--
the prefrontal cortex fatigues

781
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,410
because for two reasons.

782
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:20,770
One, when multitasking;
and two, when

783
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,570
having to switch between
sources of information.

784
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:28,330
So being too
curious, as in being

785
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,150
a bit jumpy and
frivolous about what

786
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,190
you allow your
attention to go towards,

787
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,650
if that leads to
cognitive overwhelm,

788
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,630
then those analytical
instances of the brain

789
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,550
won't do their job as well.

790
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:47,870
Yeah, so you need to filter,
you need to curate, and then

791
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:52,750
to focus and
concentrate just to keep

792
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,230
cognitive fatigue and cognitive
overload from happening.

793
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,750
So I would say that is a caveat.

794
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,730
Plus, you just don't have
enough attentional power.

795
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:09,310
It's mainly an issue
of computation, mainly.

796
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,710
It's just brain limitation.

797
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:17,470
But when one maintains enough
distance to become their own

798
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:22,190
filter and curator, then
hopefully it will get distilled

799
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,150
to what actually deserves your
attention and what doesn't.

800
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,790
Yeah.

801
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,880
This makes me think of
this interesting balance

802
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,200
that we have found ourselves in
with OpenCourseWare and our MITx

803
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,960
free online open
courses, that there's

804
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,520
a way in which the information
system online is now

805
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,560
really good at feeding that
wish for dopamine hits,

806
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,280
and the novelty continuous.

807
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,840
And on the other
hand, there might

808
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,240
be things that are out in
the world that are just

809
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,200
like too big to take on.

810
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,380
Require too much persistence.

811
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,060
But by sharing materials
like OpenCourseWare does,

812
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,120
here's materials framed
within, say, a course in which

813
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,800
they were taught, but here's
the materials openly for you

814
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,460
to make your way through.

815
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,400
There's enough of a
container that you

816
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,040
can match your
persistence at the moment

817
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,210
to track your way through.

818
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,010
It's like the best of
both worlds, if you will.

819
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:31,590
It's like--

820
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,350
Yeah, I completely agree.

821
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,770
All of this stuff to feed
your curiosity, but just

822
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,688
containerd enough to
walk you through it.

823
00:47:40,688 --> 00:47:41,230
That's what--

824
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,630
And that also restores a
bit of agency, if you like.

825
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,890
You're the one
who chooses what's

826
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:49,770
internalized instead of
everything coming towards you

827
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,410
and being a bit overwhelming.

828
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:53,670
I had that issue--

829
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:58,110
I remember when I approached
MIT courses, I thought, oh God,

830
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,050
what do I do?

831
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,770
I want to do everything.

832
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,630
And then I had that, and I
had the immunology course,

833
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,330
and I had Patrick Winston--

834
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:13,050
I had the AI course, and then I
had the mind and machine course.

835
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,930
But I noticed that the structure
in which they're presented,

836
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,690
and then the
individual structure

837
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,290
of the individual
courses, actually

838
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,920
helped me tone down that
initial anxiety, and I was like,

839
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,560
OK, hang on, I can
find my way through it,

840
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,020
so it wasn't that overwhelming.

841
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,660
Yeah.

842
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,380
Yeah.

843
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,460
It's a helpful feature to not
have a defined end date where

844
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,260
you have to finish it all by.

845
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:41,760
Yeah.

846
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,260
Yeah.

847
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,740
Yeah.

848
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:52,980
We got some other questions
about the shifting information,

849
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,100
content landscape
out in the world,

850
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:00,620
and between, say,
all the shows that we

851
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:05,500
can stream online and short-form
videos that social media is

852
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,820
pushing out.

853
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,540
What role do you think
ongoing-basis platforms

854
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:19,100
like MIT Open Learning can
play in fostering, supporting,

855
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,408
stewarding that sort of
ability for deeper learning?

856
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:24,200
This is kind of building
on what we've just

857
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,880
been talking about,
but maybe anything more

858
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,360
to think about there with--

859
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,020
Opportunities for deep
learning, you mean?

860
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:36,600
Yeah, deeper learning
beyond the short-form stuff

861
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,080
or the pure entertainment
stuff, yeah.

862
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,120
Well, I think the crux is--

863
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,520
maybe sounds a bit
elitist, the quality of it.

864
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,080
The rigor.

865
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,640
The fact that it's not
something you can-- it's not--

866
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,700
I mean, it is entertaining
and it's definitely rewarding,

867
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,920
but it's not something you
can just brush the surface of.

868
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,040
It's not something that can
be-- you can just take a look at

869
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,100
and you dive in and
out of this course

870
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,540
and then you move on to another.

871
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:18,780
It takes a certain amount of
engagement, depth of engagement.

872
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,300
Does this answer your question?

873
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,130
Yeah, yeah.

874
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:25,090
It's something that,
again, takes me

875
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,970
back to what we
were saying earlier

876
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:31,690
about the protective
effects of lifelong learning

877
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,410
and its implications on your
mental health and well-being

878
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,930
and resilience.

879
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:41,650
And there are maybe
two things to note.

880
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,890
The benefits we outlined
are dose-dependent

881
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,250
and also cumulative.

882
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:53,450
You don't derive
the same benefits

883
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,050
if you dab in and
out of interests,

884
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,530
and you don't do
it in a sustained

885
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,810
type of rigorous engagement.

886
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:06,050
And I think, at least the
courses I've completed

887
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,290
and the ones I'm looking
at now, don't really

888
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,190
allow for that type of
entertainment-led involvement.

889
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,930
You have to apply yourself.

890
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,690
And again, without
that threat that

891
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,600
can arise rise from--
to high stakes,

892
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,220
like you said,
you pace yourself,

893
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,580
and there are micro-wins,
and it comes with sheets,

894
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,660
and you can do the
exercises, and then

895
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,620
you can do-- you can read
the-- you do the assignments.

896
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:42,660
And it sort of requires
a certain level of depth

897
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,740
from the learner in
terms of engagement

898
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:51,340
that underpins a deep
learning and the benefits that

899
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,500
come with that.

900
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,180
That's what I think.

901
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,640
That's what I've noticed.

902
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,580
Yeah, good.

903
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,220
Yeah, and in conversations
with colleagues around here,

904
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,700
we are talking
increasingly about how

905
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:11,100
to complement that depth with
the right forms of engagement,

906
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,940
to have things be MIT good
without, right off the bat,

907
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:20,550
having them all be
so hard academically.

908
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,470
Colleagues over
at the MIT Museum

909
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:27,210
who were talking about this
concept of depth-on-demand,

910
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:32,070
where you meet people with
really engaging things

911
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:35,670
to pique their curiosity, but
then be able to flow through

912
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,590
and follow through with that.

913
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:41,270
It feels a really
important set of things

914
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,230
to be developing over
time, and I look forward

915
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,630
to us being able to get
into that more and more.

916
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,990
I think hard-- the hardness,
difficulty, is something

917
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:55,190
that people go for,
at least myself,

918
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,330
and when I looked
at these courses,

919
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,650
I was actually quite
happy that they're hard,

920
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,110
that I didn't understand.

921
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:04,070
Because-- and it's
normal, I think,

922
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,670
for periods of
overwhelm and doubt

923
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,590
and fatigue to occur
because the courses

924
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,430
are so difficult
and so rigorous.

925
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:16,670
But again, if we look at it from
a neuroscientific perspective,

926
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,230
it's that level of challenge
and that limbic friction,

927
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,370
we call it, that friction, that
sense of, I'm a bit overwhelmed

928
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:30,090
and I'm a bit scared, but it's
exactly that sense of challenge

929
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,690
that drives
neuroplasticity, and that

930
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,870
then helps with the
motivation to stay on track.

931
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:39,850
So I'm sure that other
people will agree,

932
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,570
the reason why we
approach these courses is

933
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,050
that they were excellent.

934
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,330
Exquisite in terms of the
quality of the material

935
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,090
and how they're taught, but
also because they're just

936
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:55,790
in that Goldilocks
zone of difficulty.

937
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,430
If something is too easy,
the brain gets bored.

938
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,890
If something is too
hard, then those defense

939
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,570
mechanisms I mentioned
earlier are titillated

940
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:08,550
and the desire to keep
going is dampened.

941
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,890
But I think they're
perfectly poised

942
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:17,540
on that angle of the Goldilocks
zone of just above that level

943
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,820
of competence and maybe a
bit higher for motivation

944
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,920
to keep you going.

945
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,020
So I was happy that they're
hard, and some of them

946
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,140
were so hard that I
have chunks of them

947
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,860
that I couldn't approach fully.

948
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,500
Professor Allen Adams's
quantum mechanics one, my God,

949
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,260
I got to the harmonic
oscillator bit, I

950
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,840
still-- even now, I have
shivers down my spine

951
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,020
and it took me quite a
while to work my way out

952
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,580
of that jungle in murky waters.

953
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:51,080
But I had a human study
buddy, and I was, I think,

954
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,180
disciplined enough
to keep going.

955
00:54:54,180 --> 00:55:00,340
So yeah, I like the fact
that they're a bit harder

956
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,260
than my muscles can fight.

957
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:04,780
OK.

958
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,000
Well, that material will
always be there for you,

959
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,980
so you can keep
coming back to it.

960
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,620
Yeah.

961
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,200
So I think we're about
to draw to a close.

962
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,770
Maybe I'll pose
this very briefly,

963
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:18,250
one last question from our
audience about, I don't know,

964
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,990
any thoughts on cultural
or organizational practices

965
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,590
that might help foster
this sort of environment.

966
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,990
For me, for instance,
that raises something

967
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:29,470
that we're very
committed to, which

968
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,270
is this sense of knowledge
as a public good.

969
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,870
That this knowledge
being out there

970
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,350
and shared freely with
the world and supporting

971
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,830
that is a really important
cultural practice that

972
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:44,790
sets the stage for
people such as yourself

973
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,450
to have access to
these materials.

974
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:51,710
And if any brief thought
on a cultural practice

975
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,230
that you would like
to see supported more

976
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,650
to help foster this
sort of curiosity,

977
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:59,910
I'd love to hear about it.

978
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,410
The first thing
that comes to mind,

979
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:06,710
and maybe not the most
relevant one, is linked--

980
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:12,100
is connected to what I said
earlier, the sense of safety.

981
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,280
Yeah.

982
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,020
The sense of low stakes.

983
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:20,300
The sense of looseness
and autonomy.

984
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,600
The not always having
to do something

985
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,980
for some extrinsic good.

986
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,440
The sense of, I'm doing
this not because I'm judged

987
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,560
and not because there's
always a job down the line

988
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,880
and I have to
complete this course,

989
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,800
otherwise I won't keep the job.

990
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,320
And I have to complete this
program in order accede

991
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:52,280
to a better job and whatnot,
to sometimes keep it low-stakes

992
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,240
and not with either a
hatchet above one's head

993
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,520
or with an immediate goal,
which is maybe not even related

994
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,520
to the main interest
in the first place,

995
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,140
but to allow for curiosity
and supporting motivation

996
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,660
to arise naturally.

997
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,180
To allow for more
looseness in people

998
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,820
to move and choose
their areas of interest,

999
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:28,140
and then pursue it in
a less judgmental way.

1000
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,800
Just people feeling more
supported and lifted--

1001
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,460
I'm using dance terms--

1002
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:41,260
rather than constantly
evaluated and pushed in a,

1003
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,940
do this so you can grab
the other type of way.

1004
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,040
Does that make sense?

1005
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,000
Yes, it sure does.

1006
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,700
I think that's a wonderful
way to wrap the conversation.

1007
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:57,180
May we all find these
safe, inviting spaces

1008
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,960
to engage in learning in
just that sort of way.

1009
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,460
Yeah.

1010
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,300
I really appreciate that.

1011
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,100
Yeah.

1012
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,900
All right.

1013
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,510
Well, this has been a
wonderful conversation, Bia.

1014
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,270
