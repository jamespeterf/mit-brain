00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,040
I'm Carara Miller.

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,440
>> And I'm Rob Stoner.

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,000
>> And from the MIT Energy Initiative, this

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,000
is What If It Works, a podcast looking

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,719
at the energy solutions for climate

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,320
change.

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,119
Today, we're going to take in the big

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,920
picture view of how energy systems are

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,119
shaped and which technologies might win

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,439
out. But first, just consider how

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,720
indispensable reliable energy is for us.

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,960
We rely on our energy systems to allow

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,120
us to do work, physical work, process

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,640
information, support all economic

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,920
activity

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,239
and we're always trying to, you know,

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,640
improve that energy system. I mean, it's

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,200
never been static. That's Jessica

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,559
Transic, a professor in MIT's Institute

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,160
for Data Systems and Society. If we look

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,039
back to the beginning of

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
industrialization in the late 1800s, we

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
started to adopt coal fired electricity

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,160
and then over time used more natural

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,040
gas, nuclear power, increasingly solar

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,479
and wind energy and you know we also

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,520
have the fuels for transportation for

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,640
industry. So things are always changing

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,720
and the economy the country that can

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,119
have the best functioning energy system

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,759
is going to have an advantage. That

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,759
advantage, she says, can play out in a

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
number of ways. It can be an advantage

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,080
in cost. It can be an advantage in

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
maintaining human health by, let's say,

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,840
creating cleaner air. It can be an

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,759
advantage in producing fewer greenhouse

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
gas emissions and helping to reduce

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,520
climate change.

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,400
>> It's really difficult to isolate oneself

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,079
from the evolution of technology that's

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
happening and really changing this

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
energy system, which is such an, you

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,119
know, fundamental part of our economy.

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,560
But of course, as policy changes, so

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,759
does our support for different

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
technologies. Transit says it's likely

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,840
that the technologies with the most

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,640
momentum are just going to keep moving

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,200
forward in our global marketplace almost

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,240
no matter what. Solar energy is growing

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,759
rapidly. Wind energy, electric vehicles,

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,080
batteries, and heat pumps. to step back

55
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,120
from those markets and not invest and

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,080
not try to be part of that transition is

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,760
risky. Part of that risk is missing out

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
on the sorts of jobs that these

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,239
technologies generate. And those aren't

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,879
just jobs for scientists, nor are they

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,800
just jobs for factory workers. More and

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,840
more, they're a whole different kind of

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,480
job. A job that brings technology to the

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,879
customer and optimizes it for them. And

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,000
in the US where far more people provide

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,519
services than actually make goods that

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,920
is an area for real potential growth.

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,319
installing. Let's say if we take rooftop

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,239
solar, installing the hardware and you

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,360
know acquiring customers and everything

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,440
that's not hardware represents about,

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,920
you know, up to 50% of the total cost of

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,800
these installation projects of the

74
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,280
actual delivered service, the solar on

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,159
your roof. And so there's a lot of room

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,280
to improve that. There's a lot of room

77
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,800
to find new creative ways to bring in

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,239
energy storage or to, you know, at the

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,640
utility scale to combine solar and wind

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,640
energy, you know, or at the commercial

81
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
scale looking at commercial solar

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,360
installations. I think there's so much

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,480
room to innovate in that space. But how

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,799
did a technology like solar get to where

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,040
it is? How did it become cheaper,

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,000
better, increasingly ubiquitous?

87
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,599
Transics research looks forward but it

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,280
also looks back. In the 70s and 80s,

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,760
Japan was a really major player in terms

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,599
of creating incentives for the growth in

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,640
markets for solar energy. They

92
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,040
subsidized the adoption of solar energy

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,480
and that grew markets for solar energy

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,360
in Japan. And then Germany took over as

95
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,519
the leader through their feedin tariffs

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,000
which essentially guaranteed a price for

97
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,920
solar electricity that incentivized the

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,760
growth in solar energy markets. And

99
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
there were other countries contributing

100
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,799
at this time as well with their

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
policies. But I'm just talking about

102
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,479
those that were leading in terms of the

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,160
size of their solar markets through

104
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,120
these policy instruments that they were

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,199
adopting. And then more recently, China

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,320
took over. And what you saw was that as

107
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,080
these different countries were growing

108
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,320
their market share through the use of

109
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,880
these policies,

110
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,759
private companies competed for market

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,560
share. They invested in this technology

112
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,680
trying to gain the advantage through

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,479
innovation over other companies. The US

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,560
also played a very significant role in

115
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,280
terms of government policy and investing

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,440
in research and development funding from

117
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,320
government that contributed a

118
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,600
significant amount to where we are now

119
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,440
with solar energy costs. So overall

120
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,800
we've seen that costs have come down by

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,639
more than 99%. It's a really rapid cost

122
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,600
reduction trend. Costs have been falling

123
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,840
by about 10% per year. Lithium ion

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,720
batteries are the one other energy

125
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,759
technology we've studied that have seen

126
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,440
such a rapid cost reduction. But solar

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,520
energy, it's so much cheaper than it was

128
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,400
a couple of decades ago. And when we

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,120
model this process, we can actually see

130
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,520
what's actually driving the improvement

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
at different levels. So we can see at

132
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,160
the level of engineering design how much

133
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,800
of the cost reduction came from

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,560
improving efficiency how much came from

135
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
improving different kinds of materials

136
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,600
that are used. When we look at all of

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,000
this at the global level what we

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:58,000
estimate is that about 60% of that 99%

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,479
cost decline came from market expansion

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,720
policies that then kickstarted a lot of

141
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,240
private sector innovation. So it was

142
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
really yeah it was really the private

143
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
sector that was innovating but it was

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,639
incentivized by these government nudges.

145
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,240
So there are many different types of

146
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,120
policies within that category. That's

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,000
one way to do it. And then about 30% of

148
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,319
the cost decline came from

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
research and development funding. And so

150
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,039
the bottom line is we can use these

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,440
kinds of insights from the past

152
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,360
to be more strategic going forward about

153
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,639
what we're investing in. So these kinds

154
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,680
of analyses can also be applied then

155
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,319
prospectively looking forward in time.

156
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,680
As listeners may know, the US didn't

157
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,360
sustain its lead in solar panel

158
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
manufacturing.

159
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,160
It wasn't able to sustain that lead. But

160
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,199
maybe with these kinds of insights, the

161
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,080
US or other countries or companies could

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,319
really find those mechanisms to invest

163
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
in, you know, at the high level in terms

164
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
of the policies, but also at the

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,720
engineering level. What are the key

166
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,280
mechanisms at the right time for

167
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
different kinds of technologies?

168
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
So, so let's talk about some of those

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
technologies because you know we there's

170
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,360
still a tremendous amount of innovation

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,919
going on in the United States not

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,759
necessarily in solar and wind although

173
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,039
there's still quite a lot going on both

174
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,840
of those as well but in other areas like

175
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,360
fusion magnetic fusion non inertial

176
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
fusion

177
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
nuclear fision the development of small

178
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,599
modular reactors and advanced reactors

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,160
is it is it possible that in a funny

180
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,000
kind of way that if we make solar and

181
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
wind too expensive and batteries too

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,960
expensive things that we tend to import.

183
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,039
Does it tilt the field in favor of those

184
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,520
other advanced technologies and maybe

185
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,440
give us a whole new kind of advantage?

186
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,680
Am I just being a mindless optimist or

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,039
is that even slightly credible to you?

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
>> Some of the technologies that you

189
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,199
mentioned are at very different places

190
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720
in terms of their development

191
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,840
>> years years and years before we have

192
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
fusion reactors.

193
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,520
>> Yeah. And I mean I think there's still a

194
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,319
lot of opportunity to innovate in terms

195
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,800
of manufacturing but also the

196
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,639
installation, the deployment,

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,000
the business models in some of these

198
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,039
technologies that are already growing

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,720
rapidly at the global scale. solar

200
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,599
energy,

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,080
storage, solar coupled with storage,

202
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,160
solar and wind, uh, heat pumps,

203
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,759
electric vehicles, electric vehicle

204
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
batteries. You know, the charging

205
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,519
infrastructure for that could be

206
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,399
improved. There's a lot of room for

207
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,399
innovation in home energy systems. Uh,

208
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,880
demand side management is an area that

209
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,800
I'm interested in and that's been around

210
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,200
for a long time, but there's many new

211
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,440
ways to do it. I think that the US and

212
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
other countries that are not currently

213
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,440
dominating in these industries can still

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,760
do a lot within these industries that

215
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,720
are growing that are becoming rather

216
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,959
established. They can still participate.

217
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I also understand Rob the reason for

218
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,640
mentioning some of the examples that you

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,279
did. So for example, there's a lot of

220
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,200
work happening on nuclear fision related

221
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,720
innovation in the US and

222
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,680
>> you know I just think though that it's

223
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,160
risky to step away entirely from the

224
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,720
technologies that are already expanding

225
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,320
and to not make an effort to take part

226
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,760
in that transition. You don't

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,839
necessarily want to try to do what other

228
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,000
companies if you're a company or what

229
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,680
other countries if you're a country

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,519
trying to incentivize innovation. don't

231
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,920
necessarily want to do what others are

232
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,839
already doing really well, but you can

233
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,480
take a part of that transition and you

234
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,720
can try to innovate there.

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,279
And I think you have to do more than

236
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
simply prevent those products from being

237
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,240
affordable in the US because at the end

238
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,320
of the day to be competitive in this

239
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
space, you don't want to just think

240
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,680
about what is within your national

241
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,519
borders. You need to be able to sell to

242
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,080
other countries. So the strategy of

243
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,600
saying okay let's step away from these

244
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,760
technologies that are produced by others

245
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,560
let's step away from those industries

246
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,560
and try to only support other ones that

247
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
are less mature and then sort of hope we

248
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,040
can catch up overnight and grow these

249
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,360
new industries you know simply adopting

250
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,600
policy in the US and focusing on the US

251
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,240
I think it's not really a winning

252
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,760
strategy it's certainly very risky I

253
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,040
think we have to take that global

254
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,880
perspective you mentioned and fusion for

255
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,760
example which is earlier in its

256
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,480
development and certainly that can be

257
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,160
part of the portfolio. So the goal you

258
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,320
have as a country versus a company is

259
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,560
quite different but both want to be

260
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,200
thinking about technology portfolios how

261
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,079
you're investing in technologies. You

262
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,600
can't invest in all of the above equally

263
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,079
because it's usually not a good

264
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,519
strategy. You want to see which ones are

265
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,440
maybe a little bit more likely to

266
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
succeed or a lot more likely to succeed.

267
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
But then you also want to invest in some

268
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,000
technologies where the future's very

269
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,399
uncertain, but they could be wildly

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,320
successful if things go, you know, the

271
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,120
way you want, if things go well. So you

272
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,680
want to have that balanced portfolio

273
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,959
and if you have the resources, you can

274
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,720
include riskier technologies, earlier

275
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,519
stage technologies. You could include

276
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,120
nuclear fusion in that portfolio.

277
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,360
But my point is that you also want to

278
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,440
continue to keep those markets that are

279
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
already growing the technology serving

280
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,680
those markets. You want to keep those in

281
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,760
your portfolio as well. You can try to

282
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,680
offer a better service. You know, for

283
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,720
example, a more robust home energy

284
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,800
system, a faster way to complete

285
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,079
construction projects, that sort of

286
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
thing.

287
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,120
So I mean I wonder if there's a

288
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,800
technology or two that if you are

289
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
looking forward now this could be

290
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,200
looking at the US it could be thinking

291
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,279
about globally but that you find

292
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
particularly exciting and that you feel

293
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,360
like is a game changer.

294
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,760
>> So I think what I'm excited about is

295
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,360
actually the fact that we have more

296
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,240
tools that we can use to provide this

297
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,639
high quality energy service.

298
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,880
you know, one that's cleaner that causes

299
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,440
less negative health impacts, one that's

300
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,200
more convenient, one that hopefully will

301
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
provide more affordable energy,

302
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
including to people around the world

303
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,680
that don't have access to modern energy

304
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,000
services, but even within countries like

305
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,959
the US, people don't always have access

306
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,600
to highquality energy services, reliable

307
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,440
energy. So, there's just more tools that

308
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,160
we can work with. So, what are some of

309
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,399
these additional tools? I've already

310
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
mentioned a number of times solar and

311
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,279
wind energy, but just to come back to

312
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,720
that for a moment, one of the nice

313
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,000
things about solar and wind, other than

314
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
the fact that their costs have been

315
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,519
coming down, is that they're available

316
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,560
in many parts of the world. So, you have

317
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,480
this resource if you combine the right

318
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,880
amount of solar, right amount of wind

319
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,399
for a particular place, you know, if

320
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,240
you're strategic about those

321
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,200
percentages, you can get a pretty

322
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,440
reliable resource. So if we take

323
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,120
Scandinavia for example, this is a

324
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
region and actually let's talk about the

325
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,000
Nordic countries which includes a couple

326
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,720
more countries. This is a region that

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,600
has nearly reached complete

328
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,120
decarbonization. So almost entirely

329
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,240
removed CO2 emissions from its electric

330
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,720
power system. And so what are they using

331
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,959
for generating electricity? They're

332
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,240
using nuclear energy. They're using

333
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,959
hydro power. They're using some biomass.

334
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,240
They're using solar. They're using

335
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,040
increasingly wind energy. So, they've

336
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,360
created this lowcarbon electricity

337
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,320
system. Not every country has those same

338
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,320
resources. But my point is that

339
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
depending on where you are, you can sort

340
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
of mix and match these different

341
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,639
resources. So with these additional

342
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,560
tools, with these large energy resources

343
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,160
and then also with the ability to use

344
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,240
electricity

345
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,480
for more services, you know, you can use

346
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,560
electricity now for much of your

347
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,680
transportation if you want. You can use

348
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,959
it for your heating through heat pumps.

349
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,480
These give you more options as well for

350
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,440
getting rid of carbon emissions, for

351
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,279
developing that reliable energy system.

352
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,000
So I think it's really that combination

353
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,160
that I'm excited about. But there's also

354
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
other aspects I think are encouraging

355
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,920
and sort of interesting to see where

356
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,079
things go. Demand side management is one

357
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,560
technology that we need to look at. It's

358
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,160
been around for a while, but there's

359
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,360
potentially the need for much more

360
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,880
demand side management. There is

361
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
potentially more economic value in

362
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,959
demand side management going forward

363
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,040
because you have these fluctuating

364
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,600
energy resources like solar and wind.

365
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,360
You have potentially new demands for

366
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,040
electricity coming on board. So you want

367
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
to manage those fluctuations on the

368
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,800
demand and supply side. So what is

369
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,120
demand side management? It's basically

370
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,279
saying that you're shifting demand

371
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,160
around in time and space. So you are

372
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,600
maybe charging your vehicles and with

373
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,440
demand side management you could be

374
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,360
incentivized to charge your vehicles

375
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
during certain times. And we published a

376
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,320
paper a couple years ago looking at

377
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,720
simply installing

378
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,560
workplace charging. What we see is that

379
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,279
simply by installing those electric

380
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,920
vehicle chargers at the workplace, the

381
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,240
effect can be very significant in terms

382
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,880
of smoothing out the peak and

383
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,880
electricity demand in the evening, kind

384
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,800
of flattening what would otherwise be an

385
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,839
evening peak. That's great because you

386
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,760
can save on building power plants. You

387
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,920
know, by putting your chargers in the

388
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,240
right place, you may not have to build

389
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,959
as many power plants. And you could also

390
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,279
use what will otherwise be solar energy

391
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,800
that may be wasted on the grid. So

392
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,759
that's an example of demand side

393
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,240
management. And in that case, you know,

394
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,920
you don't even necessarily have to ask

395
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,160
people to change their behavior or

396
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,600
charge at certain times. It's really

397
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
just about putting the physical

398
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
infrastructure in the right place.

399
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
You're putting it where people are

400
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,240
naturally parking during the days. And

401
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,480
so that's one example. And there's other

402
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,680
examples of demand side management, too.

403
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,839
you could incentivize using

404
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,320
a bit less energy at certain times.

405
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,399
That's not very popular. But what we're

406
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,560
seeing now is that some companies are

407
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,639
saying, "Oh, yeah, you know, if you're

408
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,720
willing to pay us that much, because

409
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,720
actually the savings to the system can

410
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,240
be very significant, they're saying,

411
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,600
okay, if you're willing to pay us that

412
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,839
much, we're more than willing to make

413
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,480
our demand, some portion of our demand

414
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,279
flexible." I mentioned heat pumps

415
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,920
before. You can use what are called air

416
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,320
source heat pumps where you're drawing

417
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,240
from the air so that the air is sort of

418
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,920
providing your temperature differential.

419
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,560
But you can also do water source heat

420
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,120
pumps. You can do ground source heat

421
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,680
pumps. And these water source ground

422
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,439
source heat pumps can be advantageous in

423
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,679
certain climates where you have very

424
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,240
cold temperatures. So this is another

425
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,039
exciting area of innovation. Geothermal

426
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,679
overall is an interesting area. There's

427
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,319
so many different areas and so I think

428
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,280
there's definitely a need to diversify

429
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,720
the portfolio, but still I think it

430
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
really does make sense to stay involved

431
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,559
in those industries that are currently

432
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,039
rapidly growing and find ways to

433
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,039
innovate within those. instead of a

434
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,559
specific thing like wind, you're kind of

435
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:37,360
excited that there's a new way of maybe

436
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,320
looking at grids and making them work

437
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,360
with like all the tools in the toolbox.

438
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,480
>> Yeah, exactly. grids and just using

439
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,240
electricity for more energy services.

440
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,280
You know, that's something that we

441
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,120
talked a little bit ago about these

442
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,360
trends. And that's a trend that I think

443
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,120
is also difficult to stop because

444
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,000
there's there's just an inherent

445
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,720
advantage to being able to plug in and

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,440
power something. You know, not like if

447
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,520
we were char if we were charging the

448
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,679
batteries here on our um devices using

449
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,120
like a generator and we had to think

450
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,720
about going and you know refueling or or

451
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
you know getting fuel for that. That's

452
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
just it's just inherently less

453
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,360
convenient than if you can just plug

454
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,919
into a grid an an electric power grid.

455
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,600
It's cleaner. It's easier. So I think

456
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,600
those, you know, that is a change that

457
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,360
I'm excited about and I think it's going

458
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,280
to continue. It's one that's difficult

459
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,160
to stop that transition.

460
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,039
>> So where does the where does the um

461
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,120
momentum or inertia come from in these

462
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,600
trends and a lot of what you do in your

463
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,960
research relates to trends and how

464
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,200
things are going to be in the long term.

465
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,520
A lot of that comes from cost, but how

466
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,240
much of it comes from

467
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,840
trying to capture foreign markets,

468
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,600
trying to head off climate change,

469
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,280
trying to create new industries, trying

470
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,039
to employ people. I mean, you know,

471
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,440
there there are many other things that

472
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,440
ultimately bring innovation to the

473
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,280
market besides the brilliance of the

474
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,600
initial invention. I think you call

475
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,120
those elements of the structure of

476
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,760
practice and some of the things you've

477
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,919
written. So the question is where does

478
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,520
the the momentum come from? What

479
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,520
incentivizes people and what do you

480
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,000
think is preserved

481
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,520
as as we go through this maybe short

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,559
period of change, maybe a longer period

483
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,640
of change where we're trying to

484
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,520
repatriate manufacturing.

485
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,200
>> At the end of the day, it's about

486
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,679
people working and you know getting paid

487
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,360
to innovate in these areas, right? Like

488
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
that's where it starts. It starts with

489
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
people. And if we look back over the

490
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,000
last 40 years, there's been a lot of

491
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,200
innovation in batteries and solar

492
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,200
energy, wind energy. Before that, as I

493
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,000
mentioned at the outset, we've had a lot

494
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,360
of improvements. The first coal fired

495
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,280
power plant started out at 3% efficient.

496
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,559
In 1882, I think in the US, and that

497
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,440
efficiency has increased substantially

498
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,080
to above 30% efficient on average, I

499
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,640
believe in the US right now. and it can

500
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,360
be higher than that. Um, so you know

501
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,440
it's like where did these changes come

502
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,160
from though, right? what what actually

503
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,600
has worked and I think we'd be

504
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,320
hardressed actually to find a historical

505
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,159
example of where

506
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,640
tariffs or sort of preventing

507
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,080
the flow of knowledge embodied in

508
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,320
technology has actually worked in terms

509
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,360
of benefiting new industries, new job

510
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,960
creation, technological innovation. I

511
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,240
mean there may be an example but one

512
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,320
isn't coming to my mind based on the

513
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,840
work I've done and so what what has

514
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,080
worked is to invest in

515
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,240
these changing industries these changing

516
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,520
technologies right you had Denmark that

517
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,360
adopted a lot of wind and there are kind

518
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,400
of homegrown industries benefited and

519
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,960
innovated and took a lead in terms of

520
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,000
both wind turbine manufacturing as well

521
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,200
as wind installations s and China of

522
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,320
course has also since then grown and and

523
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,559
really dominates in that area as well.

524
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,799
But you know Denmark's a tiny country

525
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,840
and they're still playing a major role.

526
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,679
So the examples that come to mind of

527
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,159
these strategies in terms of growing

528
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,640
industries, innovating, growing jobs

529
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,360
have really been about investing in in

530
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,200
in change and seeing what innovation

531
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,280
comes out. You know, there are

532
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,919
signatures in the data of where things

533
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,240
are going. The future is never perfectly

534
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,200
predictable, but I think ignoring the

535
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,520
signals in the data and sort of trying

536
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,640
to step back, trying to reverse these

537
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,840
processes of technological change is

538
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,159
more likely to result in actually not

539
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,480
staying at the forefront.

540
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,880
So, you know, this isn't exactly what

541
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,480
you were saying, Rob, but I think it it

542
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,400
relates to it. Um and I and I do agree,

543
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,280
you know, we want to diversify our

544
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,840
investment portfolios

545
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,400
and invest in a range of technologies,

546
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,559
but we also want to place bets based on

547
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,880
the information we can get in data and

548
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,679
actually technology change is not as

549
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,880
unpredictable as some people think. You

550
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,760
have created data models that sort of

551
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,600
look ahead at you know what the rate of

552
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,679
adoption might be, how fast we can go,

553
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,280
that sort of thing. give me an example

554
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,960
of what you're seeing and how you think

555
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,760
about like what those models may be

556
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
telling you.

557
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,039
>> There's a couple things we learned. I

558
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,559
mean one is that you know when we

559
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,480
started looking at a range of

560
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,320
technologies including energy

561
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,080
technologies what we saw was that

562
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,440
actually Moors law is not just for

563
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,159
computers. So we found and you know

564
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,480
published a paper in 2013 showing that

565
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,760
many technologies follow exponential

566
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,760
improvement trends and that simple

567
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,840
models like Moore's law and something

568
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,799
called Wright's law actually have some

569
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,880
predictive power in terms of giving us

570
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,200
some information about how technologies

571
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,080
are going to change in the future. Those

572
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,159
predictions are never perfect and you

573
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,120
always want to estimate the uncertainty

574
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,520
associated with those predictions, but

575
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,559
it's a good starting point. So that's

576
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,039
one thing is that you can use these

577
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,360
these data trends to get a sense of how

578
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,400
things are changing. The other thing

579
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,280
that we've looked at is ways in which

580
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,520
you can identify specific you know

581
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,400
aspects of technologies what we call

582
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,320
mechanisms of innovation to invest in

583
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,120
that may bring about the effect that

584
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,240
you're looking for. So you can actually

585
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,960
model a technology look at how all of

586
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,240
its different interconnected parts might

587
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,880
be able to change and then use that

588
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,440
information to inform what bets you're

589
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,679
placing. You know, should you invest in

590
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,840
greater efficiency or using less

591
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,520
materials? Or even at a higher level, is

592
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,159
it more about research and development

593
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,559
investment or is it more about scaling

594
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,919
up manufacturing? Or at the policy

595
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,360
level, should we invest in research, you

596
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,440
know, should governments invest in

597
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,559
research for this particular technology

598
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,679
or is it more about stimulating markets

599
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,360
and competition in the private sector,

600
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,120
you among companies that are going to

601
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,279
improve these technologies. So it really

602
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,240
doesn't have to be entirely guesswork.

603
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,240
And that's also where I come back to,

604
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
you know, regardless of your politics.

605
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,120
It's like let's take this information

606
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,880
that we have about how technologies

607
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,640
change, which ones are changing, you

608
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
know, trying to pull back from electric

609
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,080
vehicles, trying to pull back from

610
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,480
solar, wind, from energy storage, you

611
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,960
know, it's it's again it's it's not it's

612
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
just risky if you look at where the you

613
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,559
know what the data is telling us. I'm

614
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,720
not saying you can't slow it down or

615
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,760
make things more noisy, more volatile,

616
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,080
but I just don't think it's going to be

617
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,460
successful strategy in the medium to

618
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,509
long term.

619
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,509
[Music]

620
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,400
I wonder how you're feeling about the

621
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,520
future and uh we've talked about a lot

622
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,720
of things. You think you your work has

623
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,520
this sort of predictive element to it.

624
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,840
What do you think when you think about

625
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,919
the present but but also think about

626
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,840
what's ahead and and I I wonder what

627
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,039
your sort of level of optimism is?

628
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,600
>> Yeah, I mean I think I focus less on am

629
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:52,000
I optimistic or pessimistic but more on

630
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,960
like what is it that we want to try to

631
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,039
achieve with the future of technology.

632
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,279
You know sometimes it's it's about

633
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,320
understanding what is it that people

634
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,799
need. We touched briefly on electric

635
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,559
vehicles which is something that I've

636
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,720
worked a lot on. So maybe I can give an

637
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,840
example from that. You know there one of

638
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,520
the questions was okay well given how

639
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,159
people are driving how they're moving

640
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,720
around in their vehicles what would they

641
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,480
want their batteries to do for them? How

642
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,559
good do batteries need to be? Where

643
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,960
would they want the chargers to be? And

644
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,559
actually what we found was that you know

645
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
despite the fact that everybody's

646
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,320
driving differently

647
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,919
some people drive much more some people

648
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,679
drive much less and if you want to cut

649
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,600
your carbon emissions best thing to do

650
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,520
is to walk and next best is bike and you

651
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,760
know then public transit and so forth.

652
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,000
But you know if you look at how people

653
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,320
are are driving and despite the fact

654
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,960
that people have very different patterns

655
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,400
and how they go about their day, what we

656
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,360
find is that there are ways in which you

657
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,520
can really shape the technology toward

658
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,279
meeting all of these people's needs.

659
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,400
There are key locations where you want

660
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,480
to put chargers and if you invest in

661
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,880
chargers in those locations, you're

662
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,360
going to meet the needs of maybe 80% of

663
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,919
people. If you randomly put chargers in

664
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,760
shopping malls and other, you know,

665
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,320
public locations, you might meet the

666
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,039
needs of about 5% of the population,

667
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,200
right? So, and that's just one example.

668
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,360
That's just electric vehicles. You know,

669
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,240
we we saw that, okay, if you improve

670
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,240
batteries by this much, that helps, but

671
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,400
there's what's called a heavy tail.

672
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,039
Everybody has these high energy days. So

673
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,039
there you need to put chargers, fast

674
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,039
chargers in certain locations along

675
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,480
highways and along rural roads to make

676
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,200
sure people can charge when they need

677
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,720
to. So that's just one example, but my

678
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,640
point here is that we can also study how

679
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,720
it is that people are using technology,

680
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,840
what it is that they need, and then

681
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,159
another way to shape innovation is to

682
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,480
direct development toward those goals.

683
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,640
So Jessica, how do you think about, you

684
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,840
know, going from

685
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,159
early stage inventions to deployed

686
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,279
inventions at scale and and and what

687
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,600
that process looks like and and you know

688
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,080
what do we lose with tariffs? Do we lose

689
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,720
any of that? Is that does it change?

690
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,600
Yeah, I mean I will say that with the

691
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,840
innovations successes that we've seen,

692
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,960
you know, solar energy costs coming down

693
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,760
by more than 99%, wind energy costs

694
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,880
falling exponentially as well, battery

695
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,440
costs uh improving. You know what you

696
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,760
see is that part of what drove these

697
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,520
technologies forward was competition at

698
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:41,279
the global scale and companies competing

699
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,520
with one another to gain market share

700
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,360
globally. That's a larger market that's

701
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,600
going to drive faster progress. So I

702
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,120
think that's really important.

703
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,679
The other thing is that you know if we

704
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,760
think about what does it take for a new

705
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,080
technology to get invented to you know

706
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,360
see innovation which then involves the

707
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,840
adoption or the use of that technology.

708
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,919
It normally takes as especially in this

709
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,480
space of of energy what we've seen is

710
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,960
that it takes some early government

711
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,600
policy interventions and some investment

712
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:20,720
in research but also some incentives for

713
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,399
companies to grow markets and you know

714
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,720
for consumers to to purchase these

715
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,880
technologies and then you kick off this

716
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
process of competition and like I said

717
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,080
that we've seen that happening at the

718
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,559
global scale And the interesting thing

719
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,360
that we see from our research is that

720
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:43,039
you can actually be pretty strategic I

721
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,000
think in what mechanisms

722
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,760
you invest in in this process. So what

723
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,840
do I mean by that? But what I mean is

724
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,960
that you can take a technology like say

725
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,960
solar cells and say okay if I improve

726
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,840
these materials and this you know

727
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,320
improve the efficiency by this amount

728
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,120
how much might the costs come down and

729
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,799
then from there you can say okay are we

730
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,880
at a point now with this technology

731
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,240
where we should invest more in research

732
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,960
or more in scaling up manufacturing to

733
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,880
get economies of scale and then from

734
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,720
there you can actually go all the way up

735
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,080
to a policy level and say, "Okay, how

736
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,799
much do we want to balance our

737
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,039
investments in in growing markets and

738
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,440
stimulating private sector competition

739
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,760
versus investing in government funded

740
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,279
research?" So, this can be a pretty

741
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,760
deliberate process. There's always

742
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,480
uncertainty, but I do think that there's

743
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,039
ways to actually,

744
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,440
you know, be strategic, be deliberate in

745
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,000
how these investment decisions are being

746
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,919
made, even, you know, more so and much

747
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,520
more so than we've done in the past.

748
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,480
These are really interesting points. You

749
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,840
know, with globalization comes global

750
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,399
scale. And so, yeah, much more intense

751
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,200
competition, comparative advantage for

752
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,559
some who wouldn't otherwise be able to

753
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,679
provide these things within their own

754
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,760
markets, but also the scale of market

755
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,919
and the opportunity to achieve economies

756
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,200
of scale. And those those things we lose

757
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,679
if if we delobalize or or withdraw. And

758
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,760
it would be very hard for us to bring

759
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,039
new technologies to market solely within

760
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,480
the domestic market of the United

761
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,640
States. They'd be inferior technologies.

762
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,559
They'd be more expensive for a number of

763
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,799
reasons.

764
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:31,919
>> That's um a potential outcome and a very

765
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,679
scary one. You have done research

766
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,840
looking at how we take sort of highlevel

767
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,640
very broad targets and goals for the

768
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,880
climate and then translate them into

769
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,440
performance targets for specific

770
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,679
technologies. What did you find out in

771
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,120
doing that work?

772
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,960
Well, so two examples I think were some

773
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,360
of the early examples of this work and

774
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,080
then we've extended it to other cases.

775
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,919
But uh one was the case of stationary

776
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,159
energy storage because there was a

777
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,399
widespread recognition that we wanted to

778
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,320
bring we meaning people working on

779
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,760
energy storage wanted to bring the cost

780
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,600
down of energy storage. You know like

781
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,279
batteries for example that are

782
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,120
stationary so they don't have to be

783
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,880
lightweight. they can have higher

784
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,799
volume.

785
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,559
There was a widespread recognition that

786
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,120
cost should come down. Everybody knew

787
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,840
that. But the question was, you know, by

788
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,600
how much should the cost come down in

789
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,159
order for this technology to really make

790
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,360
a difference? And so that was one

791
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,840
question that we that we posed. And you

792
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,919
know, we started looking at an

793
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,159
application of storage where you're

794
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,240
using storage to do what's called price

795
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,080
arbitrage. So you're selling electricity

796
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,320
when the price is high and then you're

797
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,080
storing, you know, you're you're storing

798
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,320
that solar and wind energy when the

799
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,279
price is lower.

800
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,600
But we were able to arrive at a cost

801
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,440
target for storage. And then we

802
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,679
ultimately looked at, okay, if you want

803
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,440
to be able to meet all demand with solar

804
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,240
and wind or just 95% or 90%, what should

805
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,000
the cost of that energy storage be? And

806
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,559
there's always uncertainty of course,

807
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,600
but we were able to zero in on a

808
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:19,600
quantitative target that then has been

809
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,360
helpful in you know comparing different

810
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,360
technologies coming out of startups for

811
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,120
example or more mature companies that

812
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,760
are trying to bring their costs down.

813
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,440
though at the time we found that you

814
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,039
want to see a further, you know, if you

815
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,840
really want to get to really cheap

816
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,320
energy storage that can support very

817
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,039
large uh amounts of solar and wind and

818
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,679
even getting close to a completely solar

819
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,240
and wind dominated power grid, you want

820
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,279
to bring battery costs down an

821
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,919
additional maybe 80 to 90% relative to

822
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,080
where they are now, which could be

823
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,519
doable. I mean, it remains to be seen.

824
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,039
So, that was one example. And then the

825
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,399
other one was looking at electric

826
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,159
vehicles and saying where would you put

827
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,760
well first of all how much do you want

828
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,360
to improve the energy density of

829
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,440
electric vehicles and then where would

830
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,399
you put chargers electric vehicle

831
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,159
chargers what power should they have and

832
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,760
that involved looking at how people are

833
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,399
driving around in their cars where

834
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,720
they're stopping for how long. We were

835
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,760
able to identify some locations that

836
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,480
were, you know, predictably really high

837
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,879
payoff in in terms of supporting

838
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,560
people's need for charging without

839
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,079
causing delays, you know, without

840
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,399
causing them any inconvenience. really

841
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,399
understanding who your consumer is and

842
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,800
what they need because if you don't meet

843
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,639
those needs then

844
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,560
>> and I think with the with the stationary

845
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,879
storage it came down to patterns in the

846
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,280
uh solar and wind resources you know

847
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,359
like what were the fluctuations in those

848
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,919
resources what were the characteristics

849
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,320
the characteristic patterns there that's

850
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,280
what ultimately defines that storage

851
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,440
cost target

852
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,720
>> sounds obvious when you say it but you

853
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
know people really don't do these

854
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,079
analyses

855
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,720
It's and very often we're we're aiming

856
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,200
for a target which is you know merely

857
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,119
cheaper than it is now but it it maybe

858
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,119
taking in a direction that's still

859
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,680
completely untenable.

860
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,599
I won't name technologies but I mean

861
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,280
some that are near and dear to my heart

862
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,359
have that tendency.

863
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,520
>> Yeah.

864
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
