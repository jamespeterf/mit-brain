1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
I'm Sarah Hansen and today I'm talking

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,680
with financial economist Andrew Low

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,520
whose videos have been viewed millions

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
of times on our channel. I ask Andrew

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,920
how he makes a topic like finance

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,839
accessible to everyone. It it's amazing

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,760
how bad we are as uh homo sapiens in

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,680
managing our finances. We also get

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,960
personal about his own learning journey.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,039
I uh have a learning issue. It's the

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,119
mathematical equivalent of dyslexia.

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,519
Discalcula. You do? and I get his answer

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,060
to the question, should I use chat GPT

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,840
to plan my

15
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,640
[Music]

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,079
retirement? All this and more on Chalk

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,000
Radio. Andrew, thank you so much for

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,559
being with us today. A pleasure. Thank

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,239
you for having me. For a long time, I've

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,640
thought that if I don't have an advanced

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,719
degree in mathematics that I probably

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,320
don't have a place in finance and

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,120
probably shouldn't be thinking about it

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,879
much. But I'm wondering if you might

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
prompt me to think differently. Well,

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,840
not surprisingly, I have a very

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
different perspective as a financial

28
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,719
economist. Someone once said that to a

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,680
person that has a hammer, everything

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,159
looks like a nail and I'm guilty as

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,400
charged. I learned early on in life that

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,360
virtually everything at some point or

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,799
another ends up being about money.

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,799
Particularly with regard to any kind of

35
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,759
innovative pursuits for entrepreneurship

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,799
or career-wise, at some point or

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,479
another, you're going to have to deal

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,479
with money. and then you need to speak

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,560
the language of finance. Yeah. So that's

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,640
what really motivated me to learn how to

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,280
speak that and then ultimately be able

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,119
to develop new words and sentences in

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
that language. Yeah, it is a new

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
language. It's and it seems like it's

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
something that everybody can learn no

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,920
matter where they're starting from.

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
Absolutely. You've contributed to open

48
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,439
courseware. Your videos have been

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,159
watched millions of times and you seem

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,759
really good at making finance accessible

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,040
to people no matter where they're

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,600
starting from. I I'm wondering what it

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,439
is that you do that allows that to

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,799
happen. Have you done any reflecting on

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,399
that over the years? Well, first of all,

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,479
it's a great honor to be part of Open

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,040
Course Square and the fact that it does

58
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,280
reach people all around the world

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,959
regardless of cost or access is really

60
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,480
wonderful. And um the reason that I was

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,720
so pleased and and honored to

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,160
participate in that is because I really

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,800
feel like everybody should have access

64
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,200
to this knowledge at different levels of

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,840
course um but we all need to know a

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,800
little bit of finance and I think that

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,000
early on I was really drawn to this

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,000
field because of how impenetrable it was

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,040
and at the same time how important it

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,959
is. growing up, I just remember um

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
always hearing my mother talk about

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,080
finances and some of the challenges that

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,280
we were facing. And I think that really

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
made me hyper aware of the fact that um

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
it's really a necessary part of life.

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,280
Sometimes uh unfortunately too much a

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,959
part of life and if we don't understand

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,360
it, it's very easy to uh to end up being

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,040
taken advantage of or not being well

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
prepared for the kind of things that

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,120
finance helps you deal with. Yeah, I

82
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,239
think about this a lot when I go to the

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,120
grocery store and see cereals for over

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,280
$6 and eggs sometimes up to $8. I mean,

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,120
what are

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,840
some theories of modern finance that

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,440
everyday people like me could apply or

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
think about when I'm faced with those

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,120
situations?

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
Wow. Well, there's a whole bunch of

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,040
ideas and and important uh notions that

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,599
we can use in our everyday lives. One of

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,640
the key notions is that there's a

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,280
trade-off among everything that we do

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,080
and everything that we purchase. Far too

96
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,480
often we tend to compartmentalize and we

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,040
have a mental budget for certain

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,640
activities as well as other budgets for

99
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
other activities and we don't allow them

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,840
to mix. But sometimes if you can think a

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,439
little bit more broadly about the fact

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,360
that we have a given set of resources

103
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,519
and we have to allocate them across lots

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,680
of different activities and there are

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,080
interesting financial ways of making

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,920
those decisions, we can actually come up

107
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,000
with better outcomes. You one example

108
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,400
that I think most people are aware of is

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,200
uh borrowing money to buy a home or buy

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,320
a car. That is basically moving money

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,479
from the future, our futures to our

112
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,240
present. we're borrowing and sometimes

113
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,720
we need to put money today aside for our

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,479
kids' college fund or purchasing a car

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,840
in the future. That's an example of

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,840
moving money from today to ourselves 2

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,759
years from now or 3 years from now. So,

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
this notion of being able to move money

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,040
around and making sure that you don't

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,120
lose a lot of it in the process is part

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
of the language of finance and that's

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
something that all of us can benefit

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,000
from. Yeah, it's so interesting the idea

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,240
of having more flexible um understanding

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,040
of your resources and how they might

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
move across categories. Yeah. I mean, I

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
think at the heart of it, it's really

128
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,960
all about control, but I think not

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,759
enough people understand how finance

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,759
works so that ultimately it ends up

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,320
ruling their lives as opposed to

132
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,720
allowing them to use finance to achieve

133
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,320
the kind of goals that they really want.

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,479
So Andrew before the show we asked you

135
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,720
to respond to a question which we'll we

136
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,160
will now reveal the answer to. So the

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,520
question was should I Sarah Hansen use

138
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,479
chat GPT right now to plan my

139
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,680
retirement? What's our answer?

140
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,400
Not yet. Okay, please explain.

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Not yet because large language models

142
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,479
are not yet ready to be able to do

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
delegated financial decision-m for us.

144
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,960
Turns out that saving for retirement is

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,639
one set of activities. But then spending

146
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
while in retirement, that's a whole

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,720
different set of activities. And many of

148
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,440
us have become good at saving. But you

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,560
know, we've been such good savers that

150
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,400
we forget that at some point we need to

151
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,880
spend and and we have to spend at the

152
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,919
right rate for the right things at the

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,800
right times. So what my colleagues and I

154
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,800
are trying to understand now is not only

155
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
what those optimal decisions are. I

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
think we now have a lot of information

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,880
about that. There's been a lot of

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,319
research done on that. But the more

159
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,240
challenging issue is how do we

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,840
communicate that to people who don't

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
have any finance background and and

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,759
moreover can't afford to hire the

163
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
financial adviserss that some of the

164
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,039
higher net worth individuals have access

165
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,160
to. So, we're working on an AI solution

166
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,680
uh an AI financial adviser that can

167
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,759
satisfy the most important criterion of

168
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,199
financial advice that regulators impose

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,919
which is something called fiduciary

170
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,080
duty. A fiduciary is somebody who is

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,080
appointed to help you further your

172
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,960
goals, will look out for your best

173
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,720
interests uh above and beyond their own.

174
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
And so very often people get a little

175
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
bit concerned about you know financial

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
planners and other people in the

177
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,039
financial industry because they don't

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,160
want to be taken advantage of and you

179
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,160
know there are many good financial

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,479
planners out there but not everybody can

181
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,479
afford one. So the question is can you

182
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
for those people who can't afford

183
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,319
financial planning and for the financial

184
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,639
institutions that don't want to spend

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,000
their resources of financial advice to

186
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,080
those who aren't going to generate

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,639
enough commissions for them for these

188
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,919
people can we come up with uh financial

189
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,400
advice from an AI platform that

190
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,960
satisfies the definition of a fiduciary

191
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
some some program that you can trust to

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,039
look out for your best interest. We're

193
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
not there yet. However, I believe that

194
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,800
everybody should use large language

195
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,960
models to help them think through

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,680
retirement issues more seriously. For

197
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,360
example, ask JBT, "What are the biggest

198
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,039
issues that I need to focus on for my

199
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
retirement? How much time do I have?

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,199
What kind of ideas and products and

201
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,880
services should I make use of? How do I

202
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
get better financial information? How do

203
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,880
I learn more about these problems?" All

204
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,800
of those things I think chatbt can do a

205
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,039
pretty good job at, but I wouldn't let

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,280
it make your decisions for you. Real

207
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,919
question for you. I know a lot of times

208
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,120
when I put in a prompt that's um within

209
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,400
my domain of expertise, some of it will

210
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
be good, but some of it's kind of

211
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,319
garbage and not all that accurate. So,

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,919
as a person who doesn't know finance,

213
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,680
how do I know I can trust the answers

214
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,080
that are coming back even about those

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,160
general type of questions? Well, so

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,879
that's really why you need to have

217
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,639
additional time and effort employed in

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
thinking through these issues, not just

219
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
by yourself, but with friends and

220
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,879
family. Yeah. So we need human support

221
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
for thinking about how large language

222
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,840
models can work either well or in some

223
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,599
cases not so well. And in any case, if

224
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
you are planning for your retirement, at

225
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,919
some point or another, you're going to

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,320
have to engage with people from the

227
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,599
financial institutions. Yeah. They will

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,519
be able to help deal with some of the

229
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
so-called hallucination problems with

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,680
these large language models. But the

231
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,800
answer is like anything else that we do.

232
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
You know, how do you know that your

233
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
doctor is always giving you the best

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,839
information? Doctors are very highly

235
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
trained, but they do make mistakes. So

236
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,200
get a second opinion, get a third

237
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,399
opinion, talk to your family members.

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
Ultimately, you're going to be

239
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,000
responsible for your own decisions. But

240
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,399
the more informed you can be and the

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,080
more you can check the uh accuracy of

242
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
the information and that information

243
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,560
come from humans or from chat bots, I

244
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,240
think those are the ways that we've

245
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
developed for making sure that we make

246
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,800
the best decisions possible. Get a

247
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,839
better handle on this. Right. And I

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,240
assume part of the idea would be to

249
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,080
start this in your 20s if you can start

250
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,560
learning and start using these

251
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,120
applications to really begin to save.

252
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,200
Exactly. Many people don't realize that

253
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,760
the decisions that they make early on

254
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,920
can have just tremendous consequences

255
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
30, 40 years from now. We now know that

256
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,600
about health. We know that if we don't

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
eat right, even as a teenager, we can

258
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,279
affect our health when we get to middle

259
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,040
age. The same thing is true about our

260
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,200
finances. If we make bad financial

261
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,680
decisions early on, it could end up

262
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,760
having repercussions far beyond what we

263
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,360
typically are able to measure. And so

264
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,839
that's really the purpose of having some

265
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,080
kind of support, some kind of advice

266
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,279
that can actually look 40, 50 years

267
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,320
ahead of a teenager. It's kind of

268
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,560
interesting because at least in the US

269
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
or at least in the cultural circles in

270
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,440
which I grew up, it was sort of taboo to

271
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,200
talk about money, how much you make, uh

272
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
how much other people make, how you're

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
budgeting. Have you found that in this

274
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
context? Absolutely. And that's actually

275
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,440
one of the reasons why you want to have

276
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,160
a fiduciary. You want to have somebody

277
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,200
you can talk to about your deepest

278
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,120
secrets, your financial goals, your

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,880
constraints, the concerns that you have

280
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,800
about losing your job or or not being

281
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
able to find a job and be able to get

282
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,480
honest advice about what to do about it.

283
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,240
You know, many of us have good friends

284
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
that we can rely on for that. But if you

285
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,680
don't have a friend who has financial

286
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,399
expertise, what do you do? Yeah. So the

287
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,760
hope is that maybe a platform uh a

288
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,079
reliable AI platform that is able to

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,800
serve as a fiduciary can really help

290
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,279
individuals with all of their concerns.

291
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,839
Yeah, it's going to be a gamecher for

292
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,800
sure. What are some of the dangers,

293
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,000
pitfalls or challenges that might come

294
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,320
with leveraging AI to give financial

295
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,480
advice to people who do not have

296
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,200
financial um expertise? Well, any great

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,680
tool can easily be abused and I think we

298
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,440
have to worry about the fact that if we

299
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,440
have a financial planning tool that is

300
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,160
AIdriven, can that be abused? What if we

301
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,880
were to ask this AI to engage in illicit

302
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,760
activities uh for our financial

303
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,519
betterment? Is that something that uh we

304
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,160
should be able to do or is it something

305
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,760
that the AIS should guard against? uh

306
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,240
you get into all sorts of tricky ethical

307
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,320
questions about how these tools are used

308
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,880
and so I think that those of us who are

309
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,959
developing the technologies really

310
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,959
require spending more time thinking

311
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
about the ethical dimensions that's not

312
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,519
something that you typically focus on in

313
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,480
your research but for us now given how

314
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,880
far AI has come and what it can do we

315
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,240
have to be be much more proactive about

316
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,399
thinking about these unintended

317
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,640
consequences yeah and just how fast

318
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,959
everything is changing the technology is

319
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,880
so fluid and so fast and honestly not

320
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,480
all that transparent most of the time.

321
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah. You know, that's a concern that I

322
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,839
think most people don't really

323
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
appreciate yet. You know, it's true that

324
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
there's always been technology that is

325
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
made advances and as a result has

326
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,000
created winners and losers. You know,

327
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,279
when the horsedrawn buggy gave way to

328
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
railroads and then eventually to

329
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,880
automobiles, people lost their jobs and

330
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,200
people had to be retrained. But there is

331
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,760
a big difference between that technology

332
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
and the current set of technologies and

333
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,160
it's exactly what you said. It's about

334
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,120
speed. The fact is that right now AI is

335
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,920
moving at such breakneck pace that

336
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,480
within a very short period of time we

337
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,680
can actually have large parts of our

338
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,600
population unemployed and the hope of

339
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,160
retraining them in time for them to make

340
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,079
a difference for their lives can be very

341
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,680
challenging given how quickly things are

342
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
moving. So I think that's the one

343
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,920
concern that the AI researchers are

344
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,000
thinking about. Uh we don't have any

345
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,360
good answers yet. Um, and one of the

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,120
answers that's been proposed, which is

347
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,279
to slow down the rate of progress,

348
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
right? That's almost never possible.

349
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
Even if you want to do it, even if you

350
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,120
have legislation, there'll be people

351
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
that will refuse to abide by that

352
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,279
because legislation is not going to stop

353
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,800
that kind of innovation. It's not going

354
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,120
to stop people from having ideas and

355
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,839
wanting to implement them. Yeah. The

356
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
idea of people being put out of work um

357
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
with the advancement of these

358
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
technologies is hugely concerning. And I

359
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
know one that you're concerned about

360
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,760
because it seems like in everything you

361
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,360
do, it all comes back to people and the

362
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,720
impact on people. Um I'm wondering where

363
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,160
that drive comes from. Where did your

364
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,000
interest in leveraging finance to

365
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,000
positively impact people's lives come

366
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,760
from? Because it didn't have to. There's

367
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,160
a lot you can do with with money and not

368
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,639
worry about positively impacting people.

369
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,639
So tell us a little bit about that.

370
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,160
Well, yeah, I have to say that um that

371
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,639
was really not something that I had

372
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,399
planned. Much of my early career was

373
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,839
focused on applying mathematical and

374
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,720
statistical models to investment

375
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,360
problems, developing trading strategies,

376
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,079
risk management policies, various kinds

377
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,639
of systemic risk measures. It was really

378
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,040
all geared around the amazing impact

379
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,760
that this technology could have on the

380
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,320
field itself, on finance, making finance

381
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,920
better. and uh in some of the things

382
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,000
that I did in practice on the commercial

383
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,920
side um started up my own asset

384
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,760
management company and ultimately

385
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,199
implemented some of these strategies for

386
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,120
various kinds of hedge funds and uh

387
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,040
investors and um at some point I mean it

388
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,519
was very satisfying but at some point I

389
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,680
started to wonder whether or not um you

390
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,720
know this was uh this was it this is you

391
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,959
know what um I was meant to do and

392
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,519
around that time it's about 20 years ago

393
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,920
a number of friends and family uh all

394
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,760
developed cancer at the same time within

395
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,480
seven years six people close to me all

396
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,880
died including my mother you know I I

397
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,440
really never dealt with death up close

398
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,920
and personal before that and so it was a

399
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,720
big wakeup call and through that process

400
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,199
realized that uh finance plays a pretty

401
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,880
big role in cancer drug development you

402
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,320
know I was pretty naive at the time I

403
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,839
just thought that if there was a patient

404
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
in need and there was some great

405
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,880
technology that could help that patient

406
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,720
that somehow magically money would just

407
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,040
come sprinkling down and develop the

408
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,800
drug um But when I looked into it and

409
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,440
talked to my colleagues uh here in

410
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,680
Cambridge, uh it became very obvious to

411
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,560
me that that was not the case. That that

412
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,000
there were many examples of good drugs

413
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,639
that could help lots of patients that

414
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,320
will never ever see it to market because

415
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,959
there was not enough financing to bring

416
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,199
that to the patients. So that's when I

417
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,880
started uh thinking about how finance

418
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,480
could play a role in that. And it was

419
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,760
actually totally selfish. I wanted to

420
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,680
figure out how to help my friends and

421
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,480
family uh and how to get better drugs to

422
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,120
them. uh but in doing so it just made me

423
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,000
realize the power of finance and and the

424
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,920
responsibility that we have uh given

425
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,839
that we understand the kind of things

426
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,160
that other people don't about how to

427
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,720
finance certain kinds of projects about

428
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,720
how to bring money to a particular area

429
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,480
and really make it go faster. Um that

430
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,000
that we also have a responsibility to

431
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,639
take some of these ideas and implement

432
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
them for those really high impact high

433
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,000
societal impact kinds of uh uh pursuits.

434
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,680
Um so I started with that and then one

435
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
thing led to another and I began

436
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,720
thinking more broadly about how finance

437
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
uh impacts society in general and

438
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
realizing that there are many things

439
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,120
that we can do to further all sorts of

440
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,360
different goals. Climate change uh

441
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
energy transition. There are so many

442
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
different issues that really are crying

443
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,880
out for new business models and

444
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,880
financing strategies and these are you

445
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,320
know well-known tools that all financial

446
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,600
economists know but we haven't really

447
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
spent time thinking about the

448
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,920
applications. So that's been a really

449
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,560
rewarding aspect of my current focus.

450
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,120
Yeah. Could you give an example of how a

451
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,279
different business model might radically

452
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,839
change the climate trajectory that we're

453
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,800
on? Sure. Let's talk about energy

454
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,480
transition because clearly we are not in

455
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,480
the process of transitioning very

456
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,160
quickly. That's right. In fact, right

457
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,559
now about 82% of the world's energy

458
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,959
usage is in the form of fossil fuels. I

459
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:17,760
think that might be down from 83 or 84%

460
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,079
10 years ago. It's not enough and we're

461
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,760
not making a difference fast enough. A

462
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,280
number of people who know a lot more

463
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,319
about the issues than I do have said

464
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,319
that we're not really right now in the

465
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,240
business of transitioning because it's

466
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
not as if we're declining our usage of

467
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
energy. If anything, it's growing. So,

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
what we need to do is to come up with

469
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,760
new sources of energy, energy addition

470
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,840
as opposed to energy transition. Oh,

471
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,000
that's interesting. And so what do you

472
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,960
do with that? Where do you go? There are

473
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,039
three totally green sources of energy

474
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,679
that my colleagues tell me right now

475
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,720
that that are um not in the renewable

476
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,559
space. Obviously solar, wind, hydro is

477
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,080
important, but they're not always there

478
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,760
when we need it. We need to develop

479
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,240
better battery technologies and that's

480
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,640
all happening. That's good, but again,

481
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,400
not enough. So if we want to speed up

482
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
the process of energy addition, we need

483
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
new sources of green energy. And there

484
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,440
are three. There's nuclear fision.

485
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,840
nuclear fusion and

486
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,799
geothermal. And all of these should be

487
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,960
areas that we pursue. And so imagine if

488
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,679
we could support all sorts of different

489
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,480
investment projects in all three areas

490
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,240
and really make a concerted effort to

491
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,559
develop these new sources of green

492
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,120
energy. That's an example of what

493
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,760
finance can do. But we need to develop

494
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,320
the the political will to be able to do

495
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,000
that. And and even part of that can be

496
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
uh hastened by finance because if you

497
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,320
can show that governments can actually

498
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,840
save money in the long run by investing

499
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,160
in these if they can get a good rate of

500
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,440
return on these investments they're much

501
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,679
more likely to be able to write the

502
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
checks that we need now. Yeah, it really

503
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,400
does all come down to money.

504
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,280
Unfortunately um in most cases that

505
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,919
seems to be true. Uh but fortunately the

506
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,400
world has become wealthier and largely

507
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
that's happened because of

508
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,240
industrialization and the innovations

509
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,039
and technology that we have pioneered.

510
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,799
Uh but the wealth is not equally spread.

511
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,880
There's definitely winners and losers

512
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,520
and I would argue that the wealth is not

513
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,000
necessarily being allocated in the most

514
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,600
efficient way. If we were to change some

515
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,440
of that allocation, we could actually

516
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,160
get better outcomes for everybody.

517
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,559
Nobody has to lose. So it all sounds so

518
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,280
logical when you explain it. Uh but then

519
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,600
you introduce

520
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,640
humans. Talk to me about humans. You

521
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,360
know, human behavior is one of the most

522
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,559
interesting and most confounding aspects

523
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,720
of what I do in finance because we can

524
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,640
write down all these wonderful equations

525
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,360
that predict various kinds of

526
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,280
opportunities for financial investments,

527
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,600
but the at the end of the day, you're

528
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,440
talking about people. Yeah. And people

529
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,320
can react. Sometimes they can overreact.

530
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,320
Uh you know for example during the

531
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:02,160
pandemic the stock market lost something

532
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,160
like 30% in a matter of a few days. Wow.

533
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,240
And right if most of your retirement is

534
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,039
tied up in the stock market that was a

535
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,520
really big hit. Yeah. So a number of

536
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,039
people responded by what? By pulling out

537
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,200
their money from the stock market

538
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,559
putting it in

539
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,880
cash. That's in and of itself is not a

540
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,720
necessarily bad decision. The problem is

541
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,400
that many of these individuals, they

542
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,919
took too long to put the money back into

543
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
the stock market and they missed the

544
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,120
rebound, which actually happened just a

545
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
few weeks after that 30% decline. The

546
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,440
market went right back up. And if if you

547
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,159
had taken a vacation between, you know,

548
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,000
middle of March 2020 and middle of June

549
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,919
2020, if you had taken a vacation and

550
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,840
done nothing, you would not even have

551
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,159
noticed that the stock market moved. It

552
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,559
just went down and then back up.

553
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,240
So I think that understanding these kind

554
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,559
of dynamics is important because we

555
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,960
often allow ourselves to engage in

556
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
behaviors that can be really

557
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,000
counterproductive. And that's part of

558
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,559
what I do as a finance professional is

559
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,240
to understand how human behavior factors

560
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:07,760
into this. And it's amazing how bad we

561
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,280
are as uh homo sapiens in managing our

562
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,039
finances. And that's one of the reasons

563
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,240
why I do what I do. I'm really excited

564
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,559
about it. Yeah. You have a

565
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,880
hypothesis. What is it called? So my

566
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,440
hypothesis is the adaptive markets

567
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,440
hypothesis. And uh it was developed in

568
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,799
contrast to one of the most popular

569
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
theories in my field called the

570
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,280
efficient markets hypothesis. Okay,

571
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,880
that's a theory that says that markets

572
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,280
always and everywhere reflect all

573
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,679
available information and that means

574
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,400
that the prices that you see are

575
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,480
generally correct. And it turns out the

576
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,720
deficient markets hypothesis is not

577
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,679
wrong. It actually works most of the

578
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,919
time, but it's not complete. It doesn't

579
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,200
work all the time. And for the times

580
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,960
when it doesn't work, where human

581
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,720
behavior overwhelms the kind of

582
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,799
rationality that you typically see in

583
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,039
the markets, that's where you need to

584
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,600
understand how the mechanics of human

585
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,280
behavior interacts with the beautiful

586
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,600
logic of financial markets. That's the

587
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,080
adaptive markets hypothesis. Yeah. So,

588
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,960
as a fellow human, what can I do to

589
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,679
counteract my own um irrational

590
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,799
tendencies? Well, the first step is to

591
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,120
recognize that this is an issue. So, uh

592
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,280
if you recognize that we all have this

593
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,200
problem, that's the first step in

594
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,799
recovery in trying to understand how to

595
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,600
deal with it. The the second step is to

596
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,760
do scenario analyses in our brain. So,

597
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,480
one one of the most magnificent gifts of

598
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,320
human evolution is the ability to engage

599
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,480
in abstract thought. Okay. In

600
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,280
hypotheticals. Yeah. We can hold in our

601
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,799
mind all sorts of what ifs of what if I

602
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
decided not to go to work today? What

603
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,280
would happen then? What if I decided to

604
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,760
become a doctor, a lawyer? Uh what if I

605
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,760
decided uh to save money uh so that my

606
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,120
kids can go to college? Those kinds of

607
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,360
whatifs we can often work out in

608
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,440
reasonable detail in our heads and then

609
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,159
pick the what if that is the most

610
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,559
attractive. Uh-huh. So, right now, if

611
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,080
we're not in the middle of a financial

612
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,919
crisis, we can do the what if and say,

613
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,440
"What if it turns out the stock market

614
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,120
crashes by 20%." Okay. Given my age,

615
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
given the likelihood that it's going to

616
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
come back because based on the last

617
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,559
hundred years of history, when the

618
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,640
markets go down, eventually they go back

619
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,799
up. It takes a while, but you we can

620
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,120
actually see when things are recovering.

621
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,039
What if I decided not to sell out

622
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,600
everything? What if I decided to wait

623
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,440
and see how things go? What if I were to

624
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,919
wait two years, three years, five years?

625
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,720
Can I afford to wait? By doing those

626
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,320
kinds of what if analyses, we can go a

627
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,080
long way towards preparing for these

628
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,240
kinds of events. And this is where

629
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,840
financial planners are really helpful.

630
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
They have a lot more sophisticated

631
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,280
whatifs than you and I might be able to

632
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,159
come up on our own. And there I think we

633
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,080
can get AI to play a role because AI now

634
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,080
with large language models are

635
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,640
remarkably good at coming up with all

636
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,159
sorts of interesting whatifs. And so to

637
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,400
be for ararmed is to be to be foreworn

638
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,440
is to be forarmed. We have a lot of

639
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,200
YouTube comments pointing out that you

640
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,360
tend to make finance very accessible

641
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,400
through your lectures and I'm wondering

642
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,559
if you could articulate what it is you

643
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,640
think you do that opens the door for

644
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,159
students in your classes and around the

645
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,320
world when they watch your open

646
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,159
courseware videos. Well, first of all,

647
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,200
thank you for that observation. I'm

648
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:30,480
really uh humbled and and grateful for

649
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,600
that. If that's true, it's because I

650
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,320
often develop my lectures with an eye

651
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,320
towards being a student myself. I was a

652
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,400
high school student in New York City at

653
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,600
the Bronx High School of Science is a a

654
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,600
school that specializes in STEM and uh

655
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,960
wonderful education that money didn't

656
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,000
need to buy because it's a p public

657
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,520
school. And I u I learned more from my

658
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
classmates in Bronx Science than I think

659
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,600
I did from any other uh time in my

660
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,880
educational career. It's a phenomenal

661
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
school. But one of the things that I

662
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,880
learned from Bron Science that wasn't

663
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,960
quite right and this is my own fault. I

664
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,760
identified intelligence with STEM. So if

665
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,440
you were smart at Bronx Science, that

666
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,799
meant you were good at science and math.

667
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,640
I mean, you know, we had history,

668
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,200
English, social studies, all of those

669
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,840
other fields, but those weren't the real

670
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,279
focus of the kids that went there. It

671
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,360
you went there because you wanted to

672
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,840
study science, math, and engineering.

673
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,320
And it wasn't until I got to college

674
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,279
that I was completely disabused of that

675
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,960
notion. And it happened because I met

676
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,960
somebody who was completely innumerate.

677
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,159
I mean, he he wasn't even able to take

678
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,159
the introductory math class at in

679
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,919
college and needed my help to get

680
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,080
through it. And so, I would tutor him

681
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,840
every once in a while and um you know,

682
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,840
he would eventually learn, but it took

683
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,000
him a while and it was never easy. He

684
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,120
really sweated it out and ultimately I

685
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,799
think passed with a a C or something.

686
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,000
And yet, may or may not have been that

687
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:01,200
person, but go well. The the thing about

688
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that person uh is that he was one of the

689
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,080
smartest people I ever met in college.

690
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,679
And I didn't expect that. And let me

691
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,279
explain what I mean by that. We'd be

692
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,919
sitting at dinner and no matter what the

693
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:17,600
topic of conversation was, politics,

694
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,400
religion, music, anything that you would

695
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,000
talk about other than

696
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,720
mathematics, he was just incredibly

697
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,840
well-informed,

698
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,840
articulate, and extraordinarily

699
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,520
analytical.

700
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,640
So that really threw me for a loop

701
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,640
because again, analytical math but not

702
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,360
in his brain. Yeah. So he ultimately

703
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,320
went to law school, became a very very

704
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,880
wellrespected attorney and you know he

705
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,919
could argue anybody uh you know into the

706
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,640
ground because he had a mind sharp as a

707
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,120
razor blade. Yeah. How is it possible

708
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,799
that somebody could be so smart and yet

709
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,559
innumerate? That was a big wakeup call

710
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,080
for me and it pointed out the fact that

711
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,000
there are different kinds of

712
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,240
intelligence. So up until recently when

713
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,120
we think about artificial intelligence

714
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,880
and computation it's all computational

715
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,400
quantitative right for the very first

716
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,400
time and this is why I think large

717
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,159
language models are such a breakthrough

718
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,120
we are now confronted with a very

719
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,720
different kind of artificial

720
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,919
intelligence this is intelligence that

721
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,320
is like my friend in college it becomes

722
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,279
analytical but in a way that uses

723
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,679
language not numbers and equations and

724
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,840
so I think that large language models

725
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,760
is a different type of AI than what

726
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,520
we're used to. That's what makes it so

727
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,919
powerful, but it does have some

728
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,600
weaknesses. Just like my friend who if

729
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,919
you ask him to prove a very simple

730
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,400
theorem in calculus, he'd sweat bullets

731
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,200
doing it, but he was incredibly

732
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,559
intelligent in other ways. And so I

733
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,919
think that opens up all sorts of new

734
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,679
insights for me in terms of my own

735
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,440
students, myself, and how we think about

736
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,600
intelligence and sometimes how limited

737
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,840
we are in thinking about intelligence.

738
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,640
We measure intelligence with tests,

739
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,600
reading comprehension, vocabulary, and

740
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,840
uh, you know, mathematical problems. But

741
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,200
I wonder if there's many forms of

742
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,880
intelligence that we're not capturing

743
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,720
with those tests. And there are whole

744
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,760
swaths of society that we have somehow

745
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,360
neglected and underappreciated because

746
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,120
they have an intelligence that we don't

747
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,960
know about, we can't measure, but we

748
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,480
really could benefit from. Well, I

749
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,120
couldn't agree with you more. I used to

750
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,679
be an elementary school teacher, so I

751
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,520
saw the ways in which schools pinpoint

752
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,760
intelligence and measure it and leave

753
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,440
out large groups of people. Yeah. So,

754
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,960
we're on the same page there. Well,

755
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,679
speaking of elementary school, that was

756
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,080
one of the important and formative

757
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:43,200
experiences of my life. It turns out

758
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:46,240
that um uh in retrospect, I uh have a

759
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,640
learning issue. Uh it's the mathematical

760
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,000
equivalent of dyslexia, dcalculia. You

761
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,279
do? Yes.

762
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,880
Wow, that is so surprising. Well, you

763
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,080
know, people say that because of what I

764
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
do now. Yeah. But, um, it was definitely

765
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,840
the case that math was my worst subject.

766
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,240
And, you know, for an Asian growing up

767
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:09,039
in New York City in the 1970s, that was

768
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:12,720
not easy. Wow. So, um, it wasn't until I

769
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,520
went to the third grade that I finally

770
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,840
found a teacher that recognized

771
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,480
something in me. Mrs. Barbara Ficolora,

772
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,760
third grade, PS13 in Queens. And

773
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,480
um she knew that I was struggling with

774
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,120
math. Yeah. But yet she also saw that I

775
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,279
was really curious. I would always enjoy

776
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,880
going to the library once a week. I

777
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,120
would take out a stack of science books

778
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,080
and read them and be really interested

779
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,880
in that. And uh so she tried to boost my

780
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,039
confidence by by making me the class

781
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,559
scientist. Okay. Now, I didn't know that

782
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,480
that position existed. I certainly

783
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,799
didn't apply for it. But what it meant

784
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,159
was that I got to demonstrate one of

785
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,640
these science experiments that I was

786
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,520
concocting at the back of the room every

787
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,360
free period I could get uh and just talk

788
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,880
to the whole class about, you know, how

789
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,360
to make um a battery out of lemons uh

790
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,080
and um uh magnets. And I think it was

791
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,640
that experience that allowed me to get

792
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,320
through my elementary years despite the

793
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,000
fact that other teachers that I had who

794
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,240
were not so supportive um were pretty

795
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
discouraging and to me and and to my

796
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,480
mother back then there was no diagnosis

797
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,520
of ADHD or disalculia, right? Um so you

798
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,520
know I basically solded on until uh I

799
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,039
went to high school at that Bronx High

800
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,200
School of Science I mentioned, right?

801
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,520
That was in the 1970s when New York City

802
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
was undergoing this radical experiment

803
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,279
called the new math. I don't know if

804
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,120
you've heard about that, but it was a

805
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:44,399
widely renowned failure because it was

806
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,480
replacing the basic concepts of algebra,

807
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,640
geometry, and trigonometry with all

808
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,720
these mathematical concepts of groups,

809
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,320
rings, fields, isomorphisms, and other

810
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,799
transformations.

811
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,039
And while mathematically it was more

812
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,440
rigorous and intellectually more

813
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,200
pleasing, most of the New York City

814
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,320
school teachers were not prepared to

815
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,760
teach in this way. And so for most uh

816
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,799
schools, it was really a a failure. But

817
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,000
for me, it was night and day. I came

818
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,760
from being a C student in math to an A

819
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,720
student overnight because it was more

820
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,039
analytical and less focused on numbers.

821
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,799
No numbers. I I to this day I have a

822
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,360
hard time memorizing numbers. I never

823
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,200
memorize the multiplication tables. Uh I

824
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,880
still have trouble with 6* 7. I have to

825
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,320
actually do the calculation in my head

826
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,480
and takes me a little bit longer than

827
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,120
most people. Yeah. Uh but when you

828
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,679
replace numbers with equations, that was

829
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,440
like a huge relief. It's like, you know,

830
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,279
wearing shoes that are two sizes too

831
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,960
small and then you take them off and you

832
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,880
put on shoes that are just exactly the

833
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,640
right size. It felt wonderful. And

834
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,559
because I struggled as a student with my

835
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,120
own learning issues, I could tell the

836
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:54,399
difference between good teaching and bad

837
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,880
teaching. And of course, for a while, I

838
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,640
blamed it on myself. But then once I

839
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,279
learned a bit more about my own learning

840
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,799
issues, I began to understand what

841
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,720
certain things would allow me to see a

842
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,320
concept versus other things that would

843
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,320
confuse me. Now, when I write my

844
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,640
lectures, I often have to step into the

845
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,799
students role and ask myself, if I

846
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,600
didn't know anything about this, what

847
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,919
would be the fastest way to get me to

848
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,080
have some kind of a grasp of what it is

849
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,840
that I'm trying to teach? And again,

850
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,440
looking at it from my own lens. The

851
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,919
other part is that I've had the the

852
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,000
great gift of having a number of really

853
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,159
incredible teachers. When I was a high

854
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,640
school student, my calculus teacher,

855
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,399
Mrs. Henrietta Amazin, was amazing. uh

856
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,799
when I was a college student uh Saul

857
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,399
Levmore, Sharon Auster, Herb Scarf,

858
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,200
amazing as a graduate student, Andy Ael,

859
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,760
uh Jerry Hman, I I remember all of these

860
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,440
teachers names, uh it's because they

861
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,600
just made a huge impact on they changed

862
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,440
my life. And so part of why I spend time

863
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,000
on teaching and I think this is another

864
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,840
aspect. Some of my colleagues uh are so

865
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,679
focused on research that they feel like

866
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,919
they can't afford to spend time on

867
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,320
teaching. But because I remember what it

868
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,640
was like as a student when faculty

869
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,279
didn't take the time to try to explain

870
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,399
something in a way that would be more

871
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:16,559
understandable, I decided to spend the

872
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,519
time on working on my lectures. Someone

873
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,600
once said that um great writing is not

874
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,919
writing so that other people can

875
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,080
understand. It's writing so that other

876
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,240
people cannot possibly misunderstand.

877
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,880
Oh, that's a good one. Yeah, that's a a

878
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,799
very difficult uh standard to uh adhere

879
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,519
to. But I think that's the same with

880
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,640
teaching. teaching is lecturing so that

881
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,679
students cannot possibly

882
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,760
misunderstand and that does take a

883
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,320
little bit more time but you know when

884
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,480
you are able to land a concept with an

885
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,720
audience there is no better feeling from

886
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,559
my perspective it is you know it is like

887
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,720
you know I don't know a gymnasts you

888
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,399
know hitting a perfect landing uh ice

889
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,840
skaters being able to do a triple axle

890
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,799
without falling uh for me that is you

891
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,960
know just an incredible feeling a rush

892
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,120
that I can communicate something that

893
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,440
somebody didn't understand and now their

894
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,119
faces light up and I get it now. I mean

895
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,599
and they will forever from that point

896
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,000
they will forever have that uh to use

897
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,599
and to benefit from. And also one of the

898
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
things that um makes me particularly uh

899
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,000
grateful to open courseware is that it

900
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,280
is the great equalizer. You know, there

901
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,599
are so many people that that can't learn

902
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,159
on a schedule and that have all sorts of

903
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,280
issues that don't allow them to excel in

904
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,440
a classroom with 30 other kids. And yet

905
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,200
they're perfectly intelligent, in some

906
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,040
cases, super intelligent, but they have

907
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,679
these challenges. open course where it

908
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,440
gives them a platform at least to be

909
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,679
able to learn at their own pace, to be

910
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,119
able to stop the video, to think about

911
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,320
it, to start it up again when they're

912
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,599
ready, and there's nobody looking over

913
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,000
their shoulder seeing how well they're

914
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,879
doing relative to their competitors. It

915
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,639
it it changes the learning field and I

916
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,400
think gives opportunities that weren't

917
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,839
available. So, I I I can't tell you how

918
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,760
honored I am to be part of this and to

919
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,839
be part of the institution that came up

920
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,440
with this platform and and basically

921
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,119
gave knowledge away to the rest of the

922
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,720
world. You brought something with you

923
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,400
today.

924
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,640
I did. So, you know, when I was asked to

925
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,720
come on this program, um, you asked me

926
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,640
to bring a a meaningful momentto,

927
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,320
something small that I can carry. Yeah.

928
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,079
And I have to tell you that was a that

929
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,079
was a terrible assignment. It just took

930
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,359
me a long time cuz, you know, what

931
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,200
should I bring? A little art objects

932
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,839
that my kids made, you know, very dear

933
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,240
to me. Um, you know, my my high school

934
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,280
diploma. Uh, but I decided to bring the

935
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,960
most important um reason for where I am

936
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,960
today. And this is a picture of my

937
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,320
mother. Oh, so I um I mentioned that um

938
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,880
you know, we grew up in in New York

939
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:48,560
City. Um we were a single parent

940
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,720
household. She um uh worked um one job

941
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,240
uh with overtime, you know, to be able

942
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,880
to raise three kids by herself. I was

943
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,200
the youngest of three. and um instilled

944
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,839
in me and my brother and sister a love

945
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,640
of learning and uh the importance of

946
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,960
hard work and um you know focusing on on

947
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,359
the the longer game as opposed to you

948
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,240
know short-term issues which is ironic

949
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,200
because most of her young life as a

950
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,119
mother was focused on trying to make

951
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,160
ends meet. I would remember

952
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,560
conversations about finance pretty much

953
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,720
every single month. And it was uh it was

954
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,240
tough because uh we did not grow up with

955
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,440
a lot. Um and uh you know she was uh

956
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,760
divorced um at and that was a time when

957
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,920
um it was very difficult to to uh

958
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,480
survive as a single woman uh with three

959
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,880
kids. Yeah. But uh she did an amazing

960
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:43,119
job and um so I owe her a lot. So, if

961
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,280
she was here with us now, what would she

962
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,520
say to me about balancing the um meat

963
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,599
ends meet with the long game? Yeah.

964
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,480
Well, I I don't know that her advice

965
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,920
would be something that anybody would or

966
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,520
could do because she sacrificed her

967
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,079
career for us. She was a a lawyer by

968
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,359
training. Um left uh China when the

969
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,119
communist revolution took place. Um then

970
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:15,760
uh married someone who was uh not ideal

971
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,920
um a an abusive uh husband. Um took a a

972
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,960
long time for her to see that and get

973
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,119
divorced as she did. It was a very messy

974
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,800
divorce. Um and because he was a foreign

975
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,359
national and ended up being a diplomat.

976
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,040
Uh he was also the best thing about that

977
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,480
marriage was that he was an absentee

978
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:37,520
father because he was uh abusive when he

979
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:41,839
was around. And um so she dedicated her

980
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,839
life to her kids and um uh you know held

981
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,480
a a menial secretarial position despite

982
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,960
the fact that she was educated uh in law

983
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,760
from China and um ultimately um I think

984
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,280
uh really put the three of us through

985
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,560
school so that we could have the careers

986
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,440
that we do now. I don't know that that's

987
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,119
the right advice in general um for women

988
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,599
that are in that position because I

989
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,240
think there has to be more of a balance,

990
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,440
but for her it was just really important

991
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,440
for her kids to um reach the career

992
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,760
goals that she set out for us. What's

993
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,760
her name? Julia Yao Lo. That's lovely.

994
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,839
Thank you. Thank you for being here. I

995
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,400
really enjoyed getting to know you and

996
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,960
you've completely changed my perspective

997
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,119
on what's possible in terms of my

998
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,240
relationship to mathematics and to

999
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:36,200
finance. Good. I uh am honored to have

1000
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,200
played that role. Thank you.
