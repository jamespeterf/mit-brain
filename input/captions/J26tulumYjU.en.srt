thank you all so much um and as Dal

139
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,039
mentioned we do have a couple

140
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,759
pre-planned questions and then we'll

141
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,319
open it up at the end and have plenty of

142
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,160
time for questions that the audience may

143
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,720
have uh I'm sure something that is on a

144
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,479
lot of people's minds is career

145
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,000
progression career growth um so one

146
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,199
question that I have for you all is how

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,280
has MIT Sloan helped you navigate your

148
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,160
career options post uh program whether

149
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,759
it's MBA mban lgo or

150
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,800
mfin um and anyone can kind of jump in

151
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,080
and take this I guess I can just start

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,080
off a little bit um in my experience as

153
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,360
part of the master of business analytics

154
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,720
obviously I think all sonon we can say

155
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
that you know there's a really big

156
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
culture of sonon helping slon so that

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,400
manifests in many ways whether that's

158
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,160
Career Fairs or speaker series um I know

159
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,800
Sarah swim does a lot of those as well

160
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,919
um those are all really good ways that

161
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,919
the Alumni network and the network at

162
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,879
Sloan um really helps in career

163
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,680
development there's also the career

164
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,759
development office um one program

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,879
specific resource that I found super

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,840
helpful was the um Capstone and also the

167
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,560
uh analytics lab that we had in our

168
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,960
program and so both of those were

169
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,120
opportunities to actually work with

170
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,759
sponsor companies we had a range of

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,000
companies from biotech to finance

172
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,720
fintech Consulting and it was

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,639
opportunities for students in small

174
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,120
groups or in pairs to essentially work

175
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,960
uh like an internship with these

176
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,919
companies uh a lot of them actually did

177
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,160
have Sloan alumni running the projects

178
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,400
and mentoring us and those were some of

179
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,560
the connections that I found most

180
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,599
valuable um personally I was able to

181
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,560
work with Macy's and also visa and um

182
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,960
obviously um I really enjoyed working

183
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,240
with Visa I liked the data that they

184
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,120
were doing I liked their techniques and

185
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,479
uh that definitely helped to influence

186
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,440
where I am now a lot of my classmates

187
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,919
also found their current roles through

188
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,319
these analytics lab and Capstone

189
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,639
opportunities uh so I'd say slone really

190
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,319
does a good job of setting you up um and

191
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,759
putting you in good

192
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,120
position thank you I love this really

193
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,520
specific examples of how you know

194
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,400
classroom translate into real life thank

195
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,000
you Britney anyone else want to add

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,599
anything on that question I can go next

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,159
yeah oh Lauren and then I saw

198
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,039
you gon go after um well in my case and

199
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,879
actually kind of related to one of the

200
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,400
questions that have that has just been

201
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
asked through the Q&A I actually come

202
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,959
from a non-traditional NBA background

203
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,279
because I I studied Clinical

204
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,800
Psychology like very very different from

205
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:45,040
the business world and I was already

206
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,200
transitioning um before um joining Sloan

207
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,560
and the MBA and kind of why I wanted to

208
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,000
do the MBA it's because I felt that I

209
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,959
had already some experience working in

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,760
business development but again I wanted

211
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,959
to go to the tech world and I felt that

212
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,640
you know MIT loan was just that perfect

213
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,160
um compliment that I needed on my resume

214
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:12,000
especially because of why MIT is known

215
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:15,880
for um and so for me I was able to I was

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,959
able to see this career change and

217
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:23,040
career progression as well and kind of

218
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,360
similar to what BR said um for me I did

219
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,800
my summer internship at U in the MBA

220
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,519
program as you probably know we have two

221
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,640
years and there's a summer internship

222
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,160
ship um between the first and the second

223
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,160
year and it was hard to do all of the

224
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,320
recruiting and a lot of work but I think

225
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,480
it allowed me like the whole ecosystem

226
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,240
the alumni the career development office

227
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,240
they really helped me in trying like in

228
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,079
understanding what I wanted to do next

229
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,640
and what could be some possible options

230
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:57,480
for me and after a lot of effort during

231
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,079
recruiting I was able to secure this um

232
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,000
summer internship in something related

233
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,760
with machine learning which is what I

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,720
wanted to do and then I got the

235
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,440
full-time offer and you know the good

236
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,959
part of that is that I didn't have to

237
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,440
the recruitment process all over again

238
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,120
um for the second year or before

239
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,399
graduation so definitely that is

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,519
something that I would say for career

241
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,800
progression do take advantage of

242
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:27,640
everything that there is for everyone to

243
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,440
um leverage and and also especially the

244
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,800
summer internship which you know not in

245
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,040
every case you will have the returning

246
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,200
offer but if that if there's that

247
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,839
possibility then like it really helps

248
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,000
for the second

249
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,920
year really great advice paa thank you

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,079
and Lauren you had something to

251
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,279
add yeah I think it's quick um with the

252
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,600
lgo program it works like just a little

253
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,560
bit differently um where we have set

254
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,440
companies that we can intern with that

255
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,680
are like partner companies the sponsor

256
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,800
companies for our program um but similar

257
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,519
to The Experience they talked about like

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,079
the fact that they we already have these

259
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,360
relationships within lgo and set up

260
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,200
within Sloan um it's really helpful for

261
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,079
well for us we get matched to an

262
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,880
internship we have set companies that we

263
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,399
get to you know try out potentially

264
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,399
something totally different like for me

265
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,040
I tried out a private Equity internship

266
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,000
very different from my like more heavy

267
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,200
quantitative background so it was really

268
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,399
great to have this very like safe

269
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,040
lowrisk opportunity to try out something

270
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,680
new um and then obviously I ended up

271
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,320
going to a company well not obviously

272
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,720
but this is actually a company that is

273
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,600
one of the lgo sponsor companies so

274
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,839
again that's just an area where you know

275
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,279
there's a lot of these set up

276
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,160
established MIT relationships which was

277
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:46,920
really helpful in the recing

278
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,800
process cool thank you um and then

279
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,360
shifting gears a little bit um we all on

280
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,680
this panel identify as women uh we were

281
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,720
in some way related to swim slown women

282
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,279
and management during our time on campus

283
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,839
um so so I'd love to hear from you guys

284
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,880
kind of how you would describe the sense

285
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,800
of community among women at Sloan and

286
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,560
how it kind of impacted your experience

287
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,199
within Sloan during your time at Sloan

288
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,639
and also maybe Beyond um if at all um

289
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:19,320
Elizabeth we haven't heard from you in a

290
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,560
while so I'll I'll pass this over to you

291
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,560
thank you sure um so well first of all I

292
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,920
would say that MIT and MIT loone in

293
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,320
particular are very special for and

294
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,040
really

295
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,680
valuing diversity so at all times you

296
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,560
can see that and it is a community of

297
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,160
very smart people but also like people

298
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,480
from very different backgrounds and uh

299
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,399
when you're part of this community you

300
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,760
can see that and it's it's it there's

301
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,360
really a lot of opportunities to connect

302
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:00,320
with people from different backgrounds

303
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,720
and there is a whole setup for you to to

304
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:08,279
engage in interest groups so for example

305
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:13,040
in my case I I am Latina and new women

306
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:16,160
so I ended up being part of the Latino

307
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,199
and graduate student Association and

308
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,760
also I was involved in

309
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:27,720
The Graduate woman at MIT community so

310
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,639
in in general I would say that it was

311
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,680
very valuable to have access to these

312
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,959
interest groups and uh to be able to

313
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,560
participate in those so I would say that

314
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:45,240
it's it's just a a a great experience to

315
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,040
be part of of these groups and if you're

316
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,680
interested in in being part of the

317
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,040
leadership there's always opportunities

318
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:56,120
for people to join those um so really

319
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:59,639
the the the opportunities are are

320
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,800
unlimited great thank you um anyone else

321
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,800
want to add anything on this

322
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:10,120
topic um I can so something that'll

323
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,759
happen probably the first day that you

324
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,639
come to Sloan is you'll be added to one

325
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,199
of many WhatsApp chats and they'll just

326
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,360
keep expanding and multiplying over time

327
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,959
um so there's tons of WhatsApp tracks

328
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,320
that get created I feel like everyone

329
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,240
creates one for almost every Infinity

330
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
group and also every Niche interest you

331
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,079
might have like literally anything um

332
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,880
and one that we have that was actually

333
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,000
particularly active was just our like

334
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,079
the sloy like women chat and it was

335
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,680
really nice to just have this chat that

336
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,680
where people could you know drop in

337
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,279
surveys for a class they were working on

338
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,320
or ask where they should get their nail

339
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,759
zone or say hey we have friends in town

340
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
what are some you know really good

341
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,320
restaurant recommendations so I think

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,959
that there's just so many different like

343
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
formal channels but also lots of

344
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,639
informal channels to bolster community

345
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,519
and I would say Sal is very active in

346
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,240
those especially over chat

347
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,079
love it and happy to report that that is

348
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,560
a continuing tradition on campus so um

349
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,720
and Britney I think you also wanted to

350
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,519
add something or was it Paula

351
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,079
sorry yeah sure I can add I I have to

352
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,000
agree 100% with what Lauren and

353
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,839
Elizabeth already said um at Sloan and

354
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,040
especially an M program I never once

355
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,040
felt like underrepresented as a woman I

356
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,519
always felt like there was this network

357
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,399
and no shortage of mentors and people

358
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,839
you know you could be friends or just

359
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,519
take a lot of advice from um of course

360
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,480
there was that SLO women and management

361
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,560
chat a lot of free food there as well I

362
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,319
will add as with all the Salo programs

363
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,199
but I also remember some great events

364
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:42,000
like push for parody and um even in the

365
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:45,560
M program itself it's a pretty small

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,079
cohort 78 students but 37% of us were

367
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,000
women and so you know I do feel like

368
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,880
that number is growing over time as well

369
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,160
and it's really inspiring to see that

370
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,319
and definitely we are strong here at

371
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,440
Sloan and it's really nice to see it's a

372
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:02,639
great community

373
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,480
love it thank you um and I guess

374
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,040
carrying these themes over a little bit

375
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,360
more into the classroom I wonder if any

376
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,680
of you have sort of specific examples

377
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,720
that illustrate maybe like how receptive

378
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,040
faculty and you know professors might be

379
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,399
to adjusting their curriculum or their

380
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,839
teaching methods to kind of include more

381
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,079
diverse perspectives and voices and

382
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,399
opinions does anyone have some sort of

383
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,800
um maybe anecdote on that topic

384
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,040
I don't know if it's exactly I mean

385
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,839
first of all I would say that of course

386
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,079
um I think that at least in my

387
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,639
experience I did feel that in almost

388
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,319
every class the professors would try to

389
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:52,199
actually bring that diverse perspective

390
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:55,560
either through choosing business cases

391
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:59,959
from different types of Industries um or

392
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:02,480
from inviting um guest to speak ERS from

393
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,679
different kind of backgrounds and and

394
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,319
representing diverse groups so I do feel

395
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,760
that overall I felt that that was

396
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,959
represented um even um since the very

397
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,439
beginning during the course semester I

398
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,880
was really lucky to have half of my

399
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,000
professors and being women and half of

400
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,799
my professors being men which was like a

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,480
really I would say a bit of a surprise

402
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:28,520
but of course like a positive surprise

403
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,120
and that being said that being said I

404
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:36,480
think um at least in the MBA we have a

405
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:39,320
very um a strong um like a lot of

406
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,880
options that are especially dedicated to

407
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:46,679
courses or classes that will deal as

408
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,559
their main subject with diverse issues

409
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:53,760
there's one that I took um which was

410
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,039
about like um managing difficult

411
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,080
conversations across differences and um

412
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,080
with a diverse with with the diversity

413
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,120
mindset and and it was one of my

414
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,640
favorite classes with Professor car

415
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,799
blackborn so if you even want to go

416
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,760
deeper into those topics you can and

417
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,039
then one thing that happened that I

418
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,679
remind as anecdote that I that I recall

419
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,159
as an anecdote that um was truly

420
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,440
enlightened I would say is that we had

421
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,280
one of these classes where we would have

422
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,880
guest speakers every week and by the

423
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,880
fifth week we realized that we had three

424
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,039
guest the speakers that were men and two

425
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:39,360
that were women and we ended up asking

426
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:42,080
only to the women um how was their work

427
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,280
life balance and so we reflected upon

428
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,000
that because we said like oh you know we

429
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,960
are actually falling into this

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,039
stereotype of only asking the women how

431
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,640
they are dealing with their work life

432
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,799
balance instead of bringing this

433
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,240
question to everyone and I think that

434
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,159
the atmosphere the environment the

435
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,280
community that we have allows us to

436
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,760
bring those questions to the table and

437
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,000
actually make a change and you know we

438
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,440
did like kind of a class agreement that

439
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,360
from there on we would always try to

440
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:19,880
think um about our questions with a um

441
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,320
diverse perspective in mind as well so

442
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,200
that was something that that I really

443
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,039
that I still you know recall and use as

444
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,480
an example because it is again like the

445
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,640
environment the culture that allows you

446
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,679
to bring these questions to the table

447
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,240
and make a change from that and I feel

448
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:41,080
that in every class love it I I really

449
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,919
love the the kind of idea of collective

450
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,480
accountability and you know having

451
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,520
everyone in the class sort of agree to

452
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,200
this um new contract I love it um any

453
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,840
anyone else or any other thoughts on

454
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,320
this topic um before we move on to a

455
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,320
couple other

456
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:03,039
questions cool okay um and

457
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,280
another question that I have is you know

458
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,880
this is obviously about gender identity

459
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,640
but you know these questions don't

460
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,840
necessarily have to be or your responses

461
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,720
don't necessarily have to be um but what

462
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,520
was the most unexpected challenge that

463
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,039
you faced at Sloan and maybe how did you

464
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,840
overcome it um what resources did you

465
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,159
use where who did you lean on um where

466
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,159
did you

467
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,640
go and you can take a second to think

468
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,640
about

469
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,000
us I would say for me um I guess

470
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,960
somewhat of a challenge for sure is the

471
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,159
mam program is one of the smaller

472
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,799
cohorts in all of SLO um and so we tend

473
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,280
to kind of be in our own little bubble a

474
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,760
little bit separated off from the rest

475
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,679
of the slones and I think when it comes

476
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,880
to having a greater identity at Sloan

477
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,960
being involved that's something that you

478
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,080
know doesn't obviously come naturally

479
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,600
for a lot of the students and so I think

480
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,240
that was something that I really you

481
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,080
know knew I wanted to do is just get

482
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,679
involved in this amazing Community

483
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,159
whether that's women or um clubs career

484
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,080
oriented clubs um and so most of my

485
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,080
involvement was um with the Council of

486
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,240
mban as vice president but also I was

487
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,679
fortunate to be on the Sloan Senate and

488
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,919
I thought Sloan Senate was it's

489
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,080
essentially just like the student

490
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:25,720
government um and a liaison between the

491
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,799
Sloan students and then the

492
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,000
administration and we did a lot of fun

493
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,720
planning of EV EV uh there are several

494
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,720
subcommittees so health and wellness

495
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,080
committee that always planned you know

496
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,480
these little petting animal uh petting

497
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,440
zoo fairs and then there's also Dei

498
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,799
committee um there's the academics

499
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,080
committee so there there's also a bit of

500
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,640
curriculum reform whether that's for you

501
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,799
know greater equality in the education

502
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,279
or just changing certain lessons or

503
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:55,360
cases that we're studying um but I think

504
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,200
just taking those steps um to broaden

505
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,200
your horizon while at Sloan is really

506
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,240
important and it's actually not very

507
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,799
hard at all all the slones are extremely

508
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,960
welcoming um whether that's swim or at

509
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:07,600
Career Fairs so you know once you're at

510
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,600
Sloan just really make sure to take

511
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,200
those steps to interact with people in

512
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,279
the MBA lgo um mfin I've met so many

513
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,640
great classmates who are really

514
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,520
inspiring um great to hear about their

515
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,159
career progression and their goals for

516
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,799
the future um and so yeah it's once

517
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,960
you're at slone just make sure that you

518
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:27,600
take those steps and uh really broaden

519
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,360
your network because you'll meet so many

520
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,559
amazing inspiring

521
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,200
individuals love it thanks Britney um

522
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:41,039
anyone else have something to share yeah

523
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,880
uh so in my case I think the biggest

524
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,600
challenge was the recruiting process and

525
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,279
the recruiting process in my case I was

526
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,559
going to recruit for an internship

527
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,880
program during the summer after the

528
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,600
first year and it was the first time I

529
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,000
was recruiting in the US for a job in

530
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,000
the US um so

531
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,320
the process was challenging not only

532
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,760
because it's like a completely different

533
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,520
like setting and and in the US for

534
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,679
example like networking is very

535
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,559
important uh in my case like in Mexico

536
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,320
is not not as relevant so that was

537
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:19,120
something I had to learn and second like

538
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,760
I was trying to enter a more

539
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,520
quantitative field than my what I made

540
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,600
at my undergrad uh in which like most

541
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,440
people have like math or computer

542
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,919
science backgrounds so I think that I'm

543
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,080
having access to connecting to lumni and

544
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,000
also connecting to my fellow classmates

545
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,240
really helped me in this process because

546
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,200
they could give me a lot of advice on

547
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,559
what were the things that I had to learn

548
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,880
which were the courses that I had to

549
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,640
attend which people I had to talk to and

550
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,159
then at the end of the day I could fill

551
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:58,679
the knowledge gaps that that I needed to

552
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,679
get to the job where I am right now

553
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,880
cool thank you and then finally very

554
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,039
last question before we open it up to um

555
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,520
audience questions is uh you know sort

556
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,919
of looking back on your experience I

557
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,559
know it doesn't feel like it was that

558
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,039
long ago but looking back you know when

559
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,919
maybe you were applying or when you were

560
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,720
starting your programs at Sloan um what

561
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:22,600
do you wish you had known before

562
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,000
starting your program what piece of

563
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,559
advice do you have for uh the people on

564
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,840
this um webinar who are looking to

565
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,840
attend

566
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,440
SL and maybe we can start with Lauren

567
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,080
because I think we haven't heard from

568
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,919
you in a

569
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,440
while yeah sure um I think what I wish I

570
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,200
would have known probably found contrary

571
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,360
to what you hear is there's not actually

572
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,320
that much pressure to be like quote

573
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,000
unquote like networking all the time I

574
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,760
feel like I always went in I was like

575
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,120
okay mbas you're here to build a network

576
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,279
I need to Network all the time I need to

577
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,840
be friends with everybody

578
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,240
um and meet all these people which you

579
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,399
definitely should do but it's also can

580
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,919
be really stressful and really

581
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,520
exhausting and you can wear yourself

582
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,279
down really fast and I wish I had known

583
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,520
that the the slow Network that you get

584
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,880
is people in your class it's the people

585
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,200
outside of your class um it's really

586
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,919
nothing to stress about just like be a

587
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,840
great person and help people out when

588
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,559
you can and like this network will be

589
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,960
here for you and what I really got out

590
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,159
of the network honestly was a lot of

591
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,000
just like cultural experiences and

592
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,159
international travel opportunities I

593
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,520
didn't expect to have so many

594
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,399
opportunities to go on tracks to

595
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,080
different countries sometimes led by my

596
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,159
classmates that were from that country

597
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,240
and that was such a unique experience

598
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,679
and I was really glad that I got to do

599
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,480
so many of those

600
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:50,399
tracks I really appreciate that take

601
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,159
Lauren I feel like uh yeah it can be

602
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:57,120
hard to kind of bring yourself down to

603
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,720
reality um and I also feel like you know

604
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,679
echoing what everyone has said the

605
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,720
community here at Sloan we are a smaller

606
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,399
um school so I feel like the people that

607
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,960
you're bound to meet you will meet them

608
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,840
eventually so there's no rush you know

609
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,200
networking like crazy in the first few

610
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,880
weeks of school um and maybe let's move

611
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,720
on to Paula any kind of advice or

612
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,320
anything you wish you had known

613
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,799
before Oh my God I feel like this is a

614
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:29,039
really hard question because there's so

615
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:33,480
much that I could talk about and

616
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:37,279
I guess that of course you'll always

617
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,720
come with an idea an expectations about

618
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:44,159
how is it going to be and but I guess my

619
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,120
advice would be just like try to be as

620
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,760
open as you can during those two years

621
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:55,159
to truly enjoy everything that might

622
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,600
come that you didn't plan for um and and

623
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:02,080
and also because I think like I mean I

624
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,240
don't know anyone who had the experience

625
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,600
that the NBA didn't leave up to the

626
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,559
expectations I think like that's like a

627
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,880
really good thing that happens like

628
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,399
everyone is just Overjoyed with how the

629
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,520
experience is going I cannot say how

630
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,120
that goes in other schools but it was

631
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,679
definitely um the experience for my

632
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:24,320
class um and I know that it sounds

633
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:29,039
overly positive but like it's true and I

634
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:33,080
think a key part of that was that we all

635
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,200
um came with not low expectations but

636
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,799
with a really open mind to go ahead and

637
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,600
do those things that might surprise us

638
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,640
right like what laen you said in terms

639
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,000
of like going into tracks or like I

640
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:50,039
don't know experiencing something new in

641
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,919
my case um I knew that I wanted to go

642
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:55,480
into deep like classes that could take

643
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,640
me deeper into technology and machine

644
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,200
learning and AI but I was also very

645
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:04,559
nervous because of course a lot of

646
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,440
people had a background um that which

647
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,640
which do they had already acquired

648
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,720
knowledge regarding those topics and I

649
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,559
guess um one advice that I would give is

650
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,880
that even if you feel that you're not as

651
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,960
prepared as your as your classmates go

652
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,519
to the classes and enroll in the classes

653
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,880
that you want because it is true that

654
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,919
the community it is a learning community

655
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,600
where you can where it's actually a good

656
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,080
thing that other people know more than

657
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,960
you because that means that you can

658
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,720
learn from them and the the I think like

659
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,240
the humbleness and just like the the

660
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,880
openness to share knowledge is really

661
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,919
inspiring and again like if I wouldn't

662
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,360
if I hadn't done that I wouldn't be

663
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,080
where I am today so that would be like I

664
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,960
I guess that those would be my two sents

665
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,200
like go with an open mind and also H

666
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,960
just try to learn as much as you can

667
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,880
without without any like um preconceived

668
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,519
ideas on what you can do or cannot do

669
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:08,640
because of what other people already

670
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,679
know totally agree thank you for that I

671
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,679
love it um I I always say that slon are

672
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,679
are the best cheerleaders so even if you

673
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,799
feel like you're um you know not

674
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,640
adequate there will always be people who

675
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,840
are saying you're crazy and you should

676
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,360
just go for it so just do it and

677
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,200
Elizabeth any kind of advice uh from

678
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,919
your

679
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,159
end yeah uh well my advice is similar to

680
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,200
what Paula just mentioned so I think

681
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:37,760
that in my case at the start of the

682
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,480
program I was really nervous like I knew

683
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:45,200
that I wanted to do um slight career

684
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,919
shift into more quantive field and I

685
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,480
knew that like so many of my classmates

686
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,360
already had that background and I was

687
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,120
afraid of taking like harder classes H

688
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,399
at the end I ended up make doing it and

689
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,440
it didn't it it wasn't that hard at the

690
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:01,720
end of the day because and I think a big

691
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,080
part of that was just having the

692
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,480
community so like whenever things get

693
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,880
very challenging you can always H rely

694
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,159
on your classmates or on all of the

695
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,799
resources that you have at MIT um like

696
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:20,720
like additional time with professors or

697
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,519
with teacher assistants so at the end of

698
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,880
the day there there's always like the

699
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,559
resources there for you to learn and you

700
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,519
just have to be uh open and you just

701
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,039
have to like want to achieve a bigger

702
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:36,240
bigger goal and then the the resources

703
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,760
will be there so so I would say that you

704
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,159
just you just need to H know what you

705
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,159
want and then just go for

706
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,320
it great and then finally Britney any

707
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,640
kind of concluding advice for all of our

708
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,799
listeners here or Watchers sure yeah I I

709
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,440
would say um one thing as well and one

710
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,039
of the reasons I chose Sloan is because

711
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,279
of the such vibrant diversity within all

712
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,320
of the programs um even um M had 20 uh

713
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,000
students from 24 different countries and

714
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,919
you know within the MBA all the other

715
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,440
programs I noticed the same and that's

716
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,240
one of the things that I really stood

717
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,559
out to me about the school itself and

718
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,639
that I really got to love and really

719
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,519
Embrace and I think coming in with an

720
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,720
open mind and really getting to

721
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:20,840
experience all these cultures was really

722
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,919
so much fun so definitely com in with an

723
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,120
open mind and touching on the whole

724
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,159
point about fun definitely tons of

725
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,919
opportunities for that too sponsored by

726
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:33,120
Sloan uh one of my favorites was the C

727
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,399
functions um with with the letter c but

728
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,320
also u c as an sea at the beginning I

729
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,360
remember there was one uh yacht function

730
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,559
hosted by Sloan where all students from

731
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,559
different programs were able to go onto

732
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,159
the Boston Harbor kind of like a very

733
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,639
big nice classy party ship and that was

734
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,039
kind of the kickoff event to the

735
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,919
semester um throughout there's also

736
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:56,559
other events like Sloan Gala um where a

737
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,799
lot of students were able to go to this

738
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,519
very fancy um dance essentially event

739
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:04,440
and then host it at a mansion as well

740
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,360
and of course along the way there's a

741
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,720
Sloan Foles which is a student run

742
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,960
comedy show so just so many ways to

743
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,480
really get involved and meet people from

744
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,080
around the world and I think coming with

745
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,760
an open mind and just be ready to

746
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,760
embrace those new

747
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,960
experience cool thanks so much and with

748
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,039
that I guess I'll pass it back to Terell

749
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,840
is that correct um for the questions

750
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,840
from the chat

751
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,360
thanks s we have some questions that we

752
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,039
flag from the chat that I can ask the

753
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,760
moderator and the panelist to answer so

754
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,840
we have flagged a few um so the first

755
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,159
question we have is um what does

756
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,240
mentorship mean to you and how have you

757
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,240
found mentorship at

758
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:56,519
Sloan it's a pretty loaded question s

759
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,120
yeah I can take this because I feel like

760
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:02,039
the the panelists have been doing a lot

761
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,559
of talking so um I can talk very con

762
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:08,039
concretely about the mentorship program

763
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,720
that we actually have through swim uh

764
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:15,480
which is basically a program where a

765
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:19,559
secondy year um MBA is partnered with a

766
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,600
incoming um first year MBA uh and it

767
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,799
kicks off over the summer so it's just a

768
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,360
very you know friendly face friendly

769
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:28,159
name to kind of introduce you to the

770
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,639
Sloan Community um it's really to the

771
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,840
mentors and the mentees how they want to

772
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,639
structure this relationship but um I've

773
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,679
remained really close friends with my

774
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:38,600
mentor from last year who has now

775
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,880
graduated um and I hope to kind of

776
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,039
foster that same relationship with my

777
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,519
two mentees that I have this year who

778
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,600
are First Years um and in terms of

779
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,279
mentorship what I really gain from it is

780
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,519
just having some sort of sounding board

781
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:56,600
that is removed from you know your

782
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,519
day-to-day classes removed from your

783
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,600
day-to-day worries and just having

784
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:04,799
someone else that's outside of um what's

785
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,760
currently occupying your mind to uh sort

786
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,960
of talk to you about whatever it is that

787
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,119
you need help with um and having sort of

788
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,560
that third-party um voice to help you

789
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,280
through anything that that you'd like um

790
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,599
and then it also is great that you know

791
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,760
you have this sort of mentor that you

792
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,760
can look up to and ask for advice um and

793
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,240
then vice versa in terms of being a

794
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,119
mentor to other people um it's really

795
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,760
rewarding really gratifying I think it's

796
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,079
one of my favorite programs that we do

797
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,079
through

798
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,359
swim thanks sah another question we have

799
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,359
is for those who are coming from

800
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,320
non-traditional backgrounds uh so can

801
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:47,079
you speak to the academic workload at

802
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,720
Sloan and how you've navigated uh that

803
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,119
process whether it was the core semester

804
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,520
or all the elective that you have the

805
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,760
opportunity to

806
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,440
take I can take that um as I shared

807
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,800
before I did call psychology for

808
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,000
undergrad so when I arrived to the MBA I

809
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,280
knew that the C semester was going to be

810
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,400
challenging for me because I've never

811
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:15,200
taken um any accounting class or econ

812
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,520
class or data models and

813
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,920
decisions class which is one specific

814
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,880
class that MIT loan has at least for the

815
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:28,000
MBA and program which is part of the

816
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:31,079
course semester um I think that you know

817
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,359
first of all everyone who I know that

818
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,440
came from a diverse background we all

819
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,320
survived so I think that you know if you

820
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,720
put the effort of course um you'll be

821
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,119
able to navigate through the classes in

822
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,079
my case I actually loved it and that was

823
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,320
one of the reason why I decided to come

824
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,160
to MIT because I wanted to have a course

825
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,040
semester where I could have these data

826
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,440
models and decisions class and and of

827
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,920
course it came from an interest um from

828
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,200
a personal interest of course because I

829
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,319
wanted to go to Tech but I would say

830
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,640
that this was the best way for me to

831
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:07,920
confirm if I actually wanted to go

832
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,160
deeper into that world at least that was

833
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,480
the reality for me for DMD and for data

834
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,560
models and decisions and then I liked it

835
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,440
so much even though it was really really

836
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:20,680
challenging um that I decided to do the

837
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,839
business analytics certificate as part

838
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,119
of the MBA for which we decided to which

839
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,839
I decided to take um a lot of classes

840
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:33,920
that were heavy on again like um machine

841
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:37,040
learning um generative AI whatever those

842
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,920
things um

843
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,000
so if you only want to use the course

844
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,560
semester to go through those classes

845
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,480
you'll be able to um there are also

846
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,079
tutour that you can reach out to there's

847
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:55,880
a lot of resources study groups the

848
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:57,880
office hours like honestly I think

849
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,839
everyone will be able to do it and I

850
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,440
wouldn't I wouldn't be that much

851
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,960
concerned about it because it also

852
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,760
depends on how much you know like how

853
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,119
how good you want to do it if maybe like

854
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,599
it's a class that doesn't matter that

855
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,880
much to you or like it like it does it

856
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,560
depends but everyone will survive and

857
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,200
we'll learn from those but again if you

858
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,920
want to actually get a lot of Knowledge

859
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,800
from it you can no matter what your

860
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,800
background is you'll probably have to

861
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,400
put a little bit more effort but it's

862
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,960
doable and and for me again it was one

863
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,960
of the reasons why I wanted to come to

864
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,920
MIT thank you for sharing uh so the next

865
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,520
question we have is kind of a a great

866
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,560
segue from that previous question so um

867
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,800
what was something at Sloan that lived

868
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,560
up to your expectations and something

869
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,920
that went beyond or surprised you while

870
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,920
you were

871
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,800
here I can take that one and I think uh

872
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,040
I would also recommend this for anyone

873
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,960
with a non-traditional business

874
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,280
background but something that really

875
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,000
exceeded my expectations at slone this

876
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,040
sounds nerdy but it was Corporate

877
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,520
Finance I think it was like the best

878
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,079
cause of think get loan would recommend

879
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,160
anyone especially if you're not coming

880
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,920
from a business background to take it I

881
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,040
wasn't expecting to really like any of

882
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,400
the finance courses that I took um in

883
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,960
corporate finance but it's really

884
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,960
awesome so I highly recommend

885
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,880
that yeah similarly for me it's also

886
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,640
course related um in mban we were able

887
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,359
to take machine learning optimization

888
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,760
courses um also Hands-On deep learning

889
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,599
um as well as some other technical

890
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
courses like reinforcement learning and

891
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,680
really you know obviously because it's

892
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,480
MIT a lot of these Technologies are the

893
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,880
state-of-the-art um a lot of the

894
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,240
methodologies we were using were

895
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,000
actually formulated by one of our

896
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,880
programs professors he's the one who

897
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,680
wrote The Textbook so you know when you

898
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,960
come to SLO and MIT this is the

899
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,480
experience you're getting is really the

900
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,040
Forefront of the industry um at least on

901
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,400
the data science side and then as well

902
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,240
as the management side on the management

903
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,319
side I really enjoyed um some of the

904
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,119
courses with some mbas as well like

905
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:07,119
power and negotiation or consumer

906
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,280
behavior and a lot of the research

907
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,560
coming out of those classes is also uh

908
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,440
industry leading so it's really

909
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,520
inspiring every case study is really at

910
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,520
the top and uh it was a great

911
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,280
experience thank you both for sharing so

912
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,280
the next question we have is um about

913
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,119
pursuing the degree so given that

914
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,520
pursuing a specialization or joint

915
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,880
degree program ENT entails additional

916
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,880
coursework how does it impact the time

917
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,240
available to participate in other

918
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,520
activities and how does one balance all

919
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,520
the activity together um at

920
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:51,040
SL um I can answer that one so in my

921
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,319
case um I really want to make the most

922
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,319
of my time at MIT academically so I

923
00:39:53,319 --> 00:40:01,440
enrolled in a very U hard courses um in

924
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,680
different parts of MIT and also Harvard

925
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,640
H but I think that you can always find

926
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:12,400
the time to um comply with your academic

927
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,160
and like obligations and also be part of

928
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,200
the community and even if you want like

929
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,800
H be part of a sports team so in my case

930
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,000
like I I could do this these hard

931
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,880
courses but and also I have the time or

932
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,480
I made the time ER to um

933
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,920
be the social chair of the Latin

934
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,960
graduate student Association and I was

935
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,680
also part of the gymnastics team so I

936
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,599
think that it's really up to yourself

937
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,839
you you have to think about what are

938
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,680
your priorities for your time at M and

939
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:51,760
and then you can always make time for

940
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,720
what matters to you so I think that um

941
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,040
you can you can get the most out of

942
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,040
different worlds

943
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,839
awesome awesome uh a few more questions

944
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,880
that I've identified that I think this

945
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,520
is really good for our panel um so one

946
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,280
of them it says uh did any of you

947
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,319
participate in any prep programs such as

948
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,680
MBA launch through Forte and also the

949
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:16,680
second part of that question is now that

950
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,040
you have concluded your time at Sloan

951
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,560
and can reflect on your time as a

952
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,440
student what Rec what programs would you

953
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,839
recommend um to support throughout the

954
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,760
application process whether it's

955
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:30,720
internal at slan or any external

956
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,720
programs you all may have participated

957
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,359
in no prep programs that anybody

958
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,920
participated in or anything that SL this

959
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,599
swim uh Club did prior to your

960
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,240
enrollment that you found that was very

961
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,280
useful

962
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,079
well I'm gonna toot swims horn for a

963
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:07,680
second um I did not participate uh in I

964
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,520
actually did participate in 4te um for a

965
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,079
little bit and then I actually stopped

966
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,359
because I thought I was going to apply a

967
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,280
year later but that's a separate story

968
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,560
um I found it very helpful for the three

969
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,680
months that I was in it um so if you are

970
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,119
interested in it I would say go for it

971
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,559
um but I can't really speak to it much

972
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:27,839
more than that um in terms of swim and

973
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,400
admissions what we do obviously I'm one

974
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,599
of the um VPS of admissions for swim a

975
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,160
lot of what we're doing is interview

976
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,680
prep sessions we're doing a lot of

977
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,520
Outreach sessions um specifically for

978
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,160
women and underrepresented um gender

979
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,760
identities um for applicants who are

980
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,920
interested in coming to Sloan so last

981
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,440
year we started actually um you know

982
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,240

983
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,400
interview prep session so if you are

984
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,079

um interview process that's just one

994
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,520
thing um that we do in admissions along

995
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:23,920
with other events you know obviously

996
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,160
helping out Terell and the rest of the

997
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,760
admissions team for on-site visits um

998
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,400
lots of happenings and we're also always

open to answer any questions if you guys

1000
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,200
have

1001
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,599
them thanks Sarah another follow-up

1002
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,599
question this was mentioned earlier uh

1003
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,599
the push for parody event um so someone

1004
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,359
asked could you all speak more to that

1005
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,040
event and the impact or reaches has

1006
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:48,319
amongst women and allies at schan um and

1007
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,359
they say they Googled it and it sounds

1008
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,440
awesome but they want to know more

1009
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,079
information about it if they

1010
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,760
can yeah so I um was actually not on the

1011
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,640
organizing committee so I don't want to

1012
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,839
m speak but it is a really really

1013
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,119
awesome um event it's evolved a lot over

1014
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,160
the years but it has existed for a long

1015
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:09,800
time in some sort of version this year I

1016
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:14,200
believe it spent three weeks of non-stop

1017
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:18,359
events which then culminated in a um big

1018
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:20,960
swim hosted party that rang in at

1019
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:22,680
midnight of international women's day I

1020
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,280
think which was just really nice and

1021
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,559
symbolic um events rang from everything

1022
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,680
uh from

1023
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:34,319
you know events around like uh fertility

1024
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,839
conversations um double income

1025
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,599
households uh how to kind of break

1026
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:41,160
gender stereotypes in various different

1027
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,920
Industries we had a session on women in

1028
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,040
sports and sports analytics um and then

1029
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,160
we also had you know evening events with

1030
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,400
that were like dinner um dinner groups

1031
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,000
with women faculty which was also really

1032
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,960
special so small group dinners with um

1033
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,079
some of our amazing Rockstar faculty

1034
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,800
um who are also women um so really cool

1035
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,880
range of events they change every year

1036
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,400
we have a couple events that um do

1037
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,720
really well every year so we want to try

1038
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,920
and keep them um but I do think it's

1039
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,040
going to be a similar format this year

1040
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,440
in February another sort of three- week

1041
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,119
twoe event um with lots of different

1042
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,640
programming and um programming that's

1043
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,119
also open to and approachable for

1044
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,200
everyone not just

1045
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,599
women thanks here looking forward to it

1046
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,040
uh so the last question have before we

1047
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,079
transition to our wrap up um is um did

1048
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,559
you all take any classes outside of

1049
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:38,440
Sloan um if so why and how was your

1050
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,760
experience with the registration process

1051
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,440
whether it was at the Institute or the

1052
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,760
class that you can take uh within the

1053
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,760
graduate schools within the Boston

1054
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:55,480
area um I can answer that one so I ended

1055
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:58,319
up taking many classes outside Sloan um

1056
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,520
I took a couple classes that in Harvard

1057
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,680
in the PHD G

1058
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:06,400
Department um and in like Harvard

1059
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,440
Kennedy School and the registration

1060
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,319
process wasn't hard at all and uh to get

1061
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,800
there it was really easy I had a bike so

1062
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:16,960
I would just bike there it took me about

1063
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,480
20 minutes to back there so so yeah it

1064
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,680
was pretty easy and like even inside MIT

1065
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,680
I took courses outside SL as well in the

1066
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,119
course six in computer science and also

1067
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,520
in the PHD in economics again I I would

1068
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,520
say that sometimes it was it was even

1069
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,800
easier to register for these courses

1070
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,480
than to register for courses at slan

1071
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,599
just because there is so much demand for

1072
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,319
courses at loan that you have to

1073
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,640
sometimes B for the courses and it's

1074
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:46,480
hard to get in whereas like these other

1075
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,800
courses um they were like just bigger

1076
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,440
classes in the case of the computer

1077
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,720
science department or in the PHD Eon

1078
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,240
classes it was just very small classes

1079
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,920
so and like very meant for for people to

1080
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:03,079
join those classes so really there is a

1081
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:07,400
anle opportunity for students to to H go

1082
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:11,760
and uh study in in other parts and uh it

1083
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,760
was a great experience as well
