00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,120
Hi, welcome to Robbesity Machine

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,520
Learning Competition tackling metabolic

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,360
diseases and thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,519
My name is Chiago Batista and I'm a

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
senior scientist at the Broad Institute

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,599
where as part of the Bro Diabetes

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,080
Initiative, I work to apply functional

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,480
genomics to understand the genetic risk

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,560
of cardtabolic diseases. Together with

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,119
Julie Laffy, we've put together a

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,920
three-part lecture series to introduce

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,480
adipose biology, its role in metabolic

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,640
diseases, and how we may use machine

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
learning to better understand and treat

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,920
these complex diseases. In recent years,

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,520
our ability to perturb genes as a way to

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,640
understand their function has

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,719
dramatically expanded. Now by bringing

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,280
these approaches to disease relevant

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,399
cellar models in combination with

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,960
complex highdimensional and multimodal

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,760
data we have the unique opportunity to

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,920
convert disease biology insights into

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,079
therapeutic solutions.

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,719
However to interpret and derive

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,439
translational insights from such complex

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,520
data we also require advances in machine

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,960
learning methods. And that's where you

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
will have the chance to bring your

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,240
skills to really make a difference.

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,320
So let's get started.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,920
First I'll give an overview of the crash

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,640
course. We'll have three lectures going

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,520
from the biology of adipos tissue and

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,600
its contribution to metabolic diseases.

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,040
Then we'll follow to talk about the

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,799
technologies to perturbosite biology and

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,799
we'll talk about the data that we

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,280
assemble for this competition and the

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,799
three crunches that we'll be working on

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
during the challenge.

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
So let's start with the biology of

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,880
adipose tissue and its role in metabolic

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,119
disease. In this lecture, we'll cover

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,560
three key topics.

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,960
What is adipose tissue? Edipost tissue

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
and metabolic diseases and how is

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,479
edipost tissue formed. So what is

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,119
adipose tissue?

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,399
Adipose tissue or most commonly known as

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,280
fat tissue is found throughout the body

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,480
either right under the skin or what we

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,440
call subcutaneous adipose tissue or in

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,360
close proximity to the internal organs.

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,239
That's what we call visceral adipost

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,720
tissue. The main cell type of adipos

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,680
tissue are the adiposytes which can be

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,879
subdivided into white adipocytes, brown

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,680
adiposytes and beige adipocytes which

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,680
will share functions with both white and

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,239
brown adipocytes.

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,800
An adipose tissue serves many functions

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,959
to support our body. It can provide

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
thermal insulation so we can maintain

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,400
our body temperature. It provides

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,239
mechanical protection and intraorgan

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,879
cushioning and also it provides a safe

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,120
harbor for lipid storage and handling

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,519
which is linked to the many metabolic

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,160
functions of adapost tissue. Adipost

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,959
tissue particularly white adapost tissue

72
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,760
it's a major site for lipid storage and

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,239
release when necessary.

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,080
After a meal, our food will be converted

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,200
into glucose, amino acids and fatty

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,440
acids which are a kind of lipids

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,959
and reach the adiposytes through the

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,120
bloodstream

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,440
which then will be converted into lipids

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,319
and stored under structures that we know

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,640
as lipid droplets.

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,480
Now under conditions of prolonged

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,799
starvation, code exposure or ex

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,959
extensive exercise,

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,480
our body will send signals to the

86
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,760
adipose tissue. So these stored lipids

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,799
can be released into the bloodstream and

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,799
reach distal organs to be utilized as

89
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,760
energy sources.

90
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,400
And in between cycling this storage and

91
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,560
release functions, adipose tissue plays

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,200
a critical role in the regulation of

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,439
energy homeostasis and maintaining blood

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,680
glucose levels.

95
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,480
In most cell types, including white

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,840
adiposytes, nutrients are processed in

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,040
the mitochondria by the TCA cycle which

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,880
will result in energy production in form

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,919
of ATP.

100
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,840
Now in brown and beige adiposytes

101
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,120
there's the expression of a special

102
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,280
protein known as uncoupling protein one

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,400
or UCP1 which can bypass this energy

104
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,240
producing step and generate heat

105
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,040
instead.

106
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,320
We call this energy dissipating process

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,280
thermogenesis and it's currently under

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,000
active investigation by researchers as a

109
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,600
tool to promote energy expenditure to

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,520
combat metabolic diseases.

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,320
In addition to energy storage and

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,400
thermogenesis, adipose tissue also

113
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,639
contributes to metabolism through

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,360
communication with other parts of the

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,479
body. This involved the release of

116
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,520
bioactive molecules which will include

117
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,400
peptides and hormones, metabolites,

118
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,960
inflammatory cytoines and others which

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,960
will enter the bloodstream reaching

120
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,000
distal organs such as the brain, muscle,

121
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,360
liver and others where will regulate

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,880
functions including appetite, energy

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,600
expenditure and others.

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,080
In addition to adiposytes, adipos tissue

125
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,639
also contain many other cell types that

126
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,039
will support its function. Recent

127
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,600
progress in single cell transcripttoics

128
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,080
which is a method that enable us to

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,720
measure gene expression patterns in

130
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,520
individual cells has dramatically

131
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,720
expanded our understanding of the cell

132
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,720
types that compose adapost tissue. So

133
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,120
here's a general workflow where we can

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,160
go from sampling

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,800
tissues from donors. We can either

136
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
process or freeze those for later uh

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,080
experiments and then we can go under

138
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,400
single nucleus or single cell uh

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440
sequencing workflows.

140
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,160
With this data, we can map not only the

141
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,720
adiposytes but other many cell types

142
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,919
that will include endothelial and other

143
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,360
vascular cell types, many classes of

144
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,360
immune cells and also adipos adipocy

145
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,360
progenitors.
