1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,120
and you know you heard Bruce talk about

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,759
the manufacturing at MIT initiative uh

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,400
our next speaker Chris love is not only

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,920
a professor of of chemical engineering

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,240
at MIT but he's also one of the leaders

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,879
of manufacturing at MIT and you know I

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,720
think there's some similarities and some

8
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:19,880
differences with with Bruce Becker

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,039
whereas you know Chris has an academic

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,359
appointment and he's um an entrepreneur

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,560
um and I think in contrast to what Bruce

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,199
was talking about is applying new

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,680
technologies in in many Legacy sectors

14
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,280
Chris has experience applying new

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,320
manufacturing techniques and thinking

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
about new ways of manufacturing in an

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,200
emerging sector of uh biotechnology and

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,480
biomanufacturing so uh Chris so glad to

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,879
have you here and I'm really excited for

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,120
your

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,520
talk thanks Ben really appreciate the

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,039
opportunity here to share a little bit

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,399
about the bioeconomy uh I'll start with

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,480
a quote you know a new era is beginning

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,559
uh this was a quote that Steve Jobs gave

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,359
not about the Silicon Valley

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,079
Technologies but rather about about the

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,439
impact that biology would have in the

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,159
21st century uh so what I'd like to do

30
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,119
here is with the next 25 minutes we have

31
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,200
uh including your questions is to talk a

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,400
little bit about what is the bioeconomy

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,320
going to look like going forward what

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,040
does this really mean and where are the

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,040
opportunities in manufacturing to kind

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,840
of really fully participate and enable

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,720
that economy uh which stands to be you

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
know quite an important one in terms of

39
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,280
both uh how we deliver materials but

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,439
also things that we appreciate like

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,720
medicines as well

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,200
so the bioeconomy depending on how you

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,360
consider it what you uh you know how you

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,439
measure it it really can touch

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,079
everything that we have going forward in

46
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,240
fact some estimates have put this at you

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
know approximately $4 trillion dollar of

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,840
Economic Development over the next 10

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,000
years uh with about a trillion of that

50
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,479
attributed to the United States and this

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,119
really cuts across really every sector

52
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,880
that uh is a key part of our economy

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,039
biology is going to have a role in

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,159
contributing to production in each of

55
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,640
these different spaces and some of you

56
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,759
might already have some experience in uh

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,440
materials and products that are already

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,879
enabled by biology picked a few examples

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,239
here there's many more I'm sure but if

60
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,000
you've had an impossible Burger

61
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,680
somewhere uh you have had a bioeconomy

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,080
type product Stella McCartney and many

63
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,000
other designers are really thinking

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,440
deeply about how to use materials that

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,519
are made from biological sources uh as

66
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,040
part of their fashion uh wees and we see

67
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,920
a number of different chemicals now

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,720
especially fine chemic chical fragrances

69
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,200
and intermediate ingredients starting to

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,720
be made by biological methods and so in

71
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,120
all of these different areas you know

72
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,840
there's some estimates that as much as

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
60% of raw materials around the world

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,879
could be produced by biology in the next

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,159
10 to 15

76
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,360
years what's really powerful in thinking

77
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,800
about the bioeconomy is that it is

78
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,800
something that offers a completely

79
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,120
circular approach uh the the the source

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,440
of energy in biology to generate plants

81
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,680
and such of course is the Sun these

82
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,000
plants can be broken down or different

83
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,080
kinds of materials can be broken down

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,640
and processed into other raw ingredients

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
and materials that can be used then to

86
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,599
create what I would call Value ad

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,400
products uh Fine Chemicals specific uh

88
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,879
proteins uh cells that we need for

89
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,680
different kinds of uh other products and

90
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,920
if done in the right way these are uh

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
circular types of processes and what's

92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,720
really interesting about this is an

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,000
economic style is that this can occur at

94
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,040
a very macro scale level right across

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,920
the globe but it could also be done at a

96
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,519
very local level and so there's

97
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,959
opportunities as we think about what the

98
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,000
bioeconomy is going to look like uh to

99
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:43,200
think both locally and globally in terms

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,200
of how these systems might uh

101
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,360
interact and just to put it in

102
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,439
perspective I I really like this

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,799
analysis which looks specifically at

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,040
growing plant-based Pro proteins you

105
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,480
know through a variety of different

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,760
mechanisms but you can see the sort of

107
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,799
impact that uh investing in this

108
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,239
particular space of ology can have on

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,519
things like uh sustainability uh this is

110
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,519
just looking across several different

111
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,760
sectors as to money invested in what's

112
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,079
the the largest impact on reducing

113
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,400
carbon uh emission equivalents and the

114
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,680
bioeconomy because it's natural you know

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,160
using water and and uh natural energy

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
sources is intrinsically a more

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,960
sustainable type of approach and so a

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,639
place where you get a lot of of benefit

119
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,320
from it and so I think intrinsically

120
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,039
linked into

121
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,479
the creation of the bioeconomy that's

122
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,440
emerging is this need to think about how

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,400
do we do this in a in a more sustainable

124
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,560
way as

125
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,919
well and just to put it in perspective

126
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,000
you know just to put some numbers around

127
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,759
it this effectively like for for

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,240
plant-based uh materials if we reached

129
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,240
kind of 11% penetrance of the of the

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
proteins into the overall market for

131
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,759
ingredients and Foods you could save

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,280
roughly a gigaton of CO2 emitted a year

133
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,320
this is roughly you know one year of

134
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,919
carbon neutral Japan or enough water for

135
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,320
London for 40 years so I think kind of

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
starts to put into perspective the

137
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,000
potential impact that even just a small

138
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,360
amount of this economy can have uh more

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,680
globally in total but the question of

140
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,479
course becomes like how do we think

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,600
about starting to unlock this potential

142
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,039
right this all sounds great and there's

143
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,240
a number of different elements that are

144
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,160
starting to emerge here uh we're seeing

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,800
the first wave of these kinds of

146
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,400
companies moving into the

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
space the nature of all products right

148
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,080
at the heart of it is

149
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,319
manufacturing we are as a as a nation

150
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,240
very uh good at Ting lots of new ideas

151
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,160
in fact the tools in synthetic biology

152
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,880
and metabolic engineering some of these

153
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,160
uh disciplines that have emerged to

154
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,120
reshape biology and to build things new

155
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,720
that weren't possible before are vastly

156
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,319
exploded right we have a number of

157
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,039
different research centers and labs

158
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,479
around the country startup companies

159
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,520
that are creating new ideas in this

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,880
space uh but as we can kind of see from

161
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,360
this uh pcast report uh presidential

162
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,360
advisory Council report uh from a couple

163
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
years ago now biomanufacturing is that

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,039
critical link it links that product idea

165
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,160
and the research that we're doing in

166
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,759
that space to the marketplace and so the

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,479
question becomes given all of the

168
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,240
potential of the bioeconomy what's going

169
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,240
to be necessary to really truly

170
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,639
transform the biom manufacturing base

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,560
that we have in order to be able to

172
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,759
realize this economy at

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,960
scale and so I appreciate that not

174
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,759
everyone maybe is is fully firsts in

175
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,840
what goes into biomanufacturing and this

176
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,000
term I I find gets thrown around in a

177
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,919
lot of different ways right now uh in in

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
the the broader uh community

179
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,520
when we think about biomanufacturing

180
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,360
this is really about establishing

181
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,440
reliable processes to make and package

182
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,639
products that use biology at the core of

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,599
it uh and so this is at scale these are

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,280
you know tools that are being used to

185
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,759
produce uh the the material to purify it

186
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,520
and then the example that I've given

187
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,240
here is in formulation for a medicine

188
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,879
but some type of packaging that is you

189
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,639
know could be for a food product or a

190
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,440
fragrance for example um what what this

191
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,000
typically involves is cells and cells

192
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,919
are messy cells are biology they grow

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,759
and they're not perfectly understood but

194
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,599
what's amazing is that the tools for

195
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,759
uncovering that biology are starting to

196
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,720
change quite drastically and so we're

197
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
starting to be much more precise in our

198
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,240
ability to Define and understand these

199
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,160
and so what I want to do in the time

200
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,639
that we have here left together is kind

201
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,240
of unpack a little bit about what

202
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,599
biomanufacturing looks like today and

203
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,080
where it might be headed next uh based

204
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:30,280
on some of these uh convergences of

205
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,120
better understanding of the biology

206
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,000
Automation and the advances that are now

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,479
possible at the interfaces between these

208
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,680
two spaces we heard in the last session

209
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,840
about AI that certainly has a component

210
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
in this as well uh and something that we

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,000
can we can think more about perhaps in

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,960
the panel

213
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,879
discussion all right so let's start with

214
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,840
what biomanufacturing looks like today

215
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,520
it's complicated it looks like you went

216
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,240
into your lab and you have a a little

217
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,080
flask that you grow some cells in and

218
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,159
then you you purify them through some

219
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,000
type of filter and you do something a bi

220
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,199
Manu facturing facility today largely

221
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,319
looks like that benchtop experiment

222
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,360
expanded at a much larger scale it's

223
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,960
very manual it's very complex and it has

224
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
a lot of touch points and so this means

225
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,400
that quality assurance and other types

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,039
of processes that we consider when we

227
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,960
think about manufacturing to ensure you

228
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,560
know reproducibility and reliability of

229
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,599
the products that are being produced has

230
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
a very different connotation we have to

231
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,319
be able to look at different

232
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,039
intermediate points to make sure that

233
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,000
things didn't get changed when somebody

234
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,479
took the VAP of material from one room

235
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,080
to the other one to start something new

236
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,320
and so this kind of lends itself not so

237
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,120
well right to thinking about this this

238
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,560
other vision of of a transformed

239
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,000
bioeconomy in which making products with

240
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,680
Biology becomes much more fasile and so

241
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,480
it's at this interface that we have to

242
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,959
think about what could be possible

243
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,200
next today to build one of these types

244
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,120
of facilities like the one that I've

245
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,560
shown you uh it depends a little bit on

246
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,200
the industry and the specifics that

247
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,160
you're interested in but you know

248
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,959
anywhere between 30 million and up to 2

249
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,519
billion

250
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,320
to build and it could take as long as 2

251
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,399
to 5 years to actually get all of the

252
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
physical equipment into a building

253
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,480
qualified validated and ready for

254
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,000
production uh so the lead times to build

255
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,959
this very large capital expenditure is

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,040
long uh and one of these facilities

257
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,880
typically only operates maybe 20 to 40

258
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,600
campaigns per year of operations and of

259
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
any kind and so as a result right that

260
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
you know building one facility is only

261
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,240
linearly scaling the Capac capacity that

262
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,200
we have access to in addition we need a

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,880
really large and expert trained

264
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,760
Workforce many of the folks that work in

265
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,880
this industry have advanced degrees or

266
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,279
uh you have trained with very specific

267
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,640
skill sets to be able to uh to operate

268
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,600
these types of protocols and to make

269
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,440
sure that the quality management is

270
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,440
there and so you know from an economics

271
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,560
standpoint right we really need to do

272
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,200
more with less how do we get to smaller

273
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,640
facilities that are faster to stand up

274
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,399
that cost less capex and perhaps use a

275
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,880
different kind of skilled labor in order

276
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,360
to actually operate these and so it's at

277
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,720
this intersection that we've been

278
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,800
thinking a lot over the last couple of

279
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,680
years uh and we'll talk about that a

280
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
little bit more

281
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,720
here the other challenge in

282
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,519
manufacturing that we have to think

283
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,440
about how to overcome is the complexity

284
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,920
and diversity of products I've shown

285
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,240
here sort of one one way to Envision

286
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,480
this this sort of paramal scheme where

287
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,000
at the base of this are the core

288
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,320
elements that we need to make anything

289
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,720
in biology this is salts and sugar

290
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,000
sugars and uh amino acids you might need

291
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,200
some plastic so the chemicals these are

292
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,639
used to produce things like DNA or

293
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,160
proteins which are then used to make

294
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:43,000
more complex products like mRNA vaccines

295
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,959
or uh alternative food products or

296
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,399
microbiome type uh Solutions and then

297
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,519
these might even be integrated a step

298
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,519
further into artificial tissues the

299
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,959
challenge is kind of the one that's

300
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,800
shown on the left that as we start to

301
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,360
scale the the biology into more and more

302
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,040
complex Solutions the cost of manufa

303
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
facturing those is

304
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,839
increasing there's also a challenge in

305
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,000
that as we want to introduce new

306
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,000
products into the marketplace we have to

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,720
have access to capacity I've mentioned

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,079
how expensive the capacity is to build

309
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,680
out if we think about where that

310
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,000
capacity lies a very large amount of it

311
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,519
lies in other parts of the world so in

312
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,880
Europe and and and Asia these are not

313
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,079
facilities that are available in the

314
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,000
United States for manufacturing and so

315
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,880
there's a kind of crunch overall in the

316
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,519
capacity that's available in thinking

317
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,079
about bringing those Innovative new

318
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,519
ideas and new products that could be

319
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,399
really important for the economy overall

320
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,800
into the marketplace in a timely and

321
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,839
efficient

322
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,320
manner the other challenge of course I'm

323
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
sure as you appreciate is the capital

324
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,440
expenses and the Returns on investment

325
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,079
are best suited at the more complex

326
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,279
biological products which means that we

327
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,000
are also at a point where we need to

328
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,639
think carefully about what it looks like

329
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,480
to to assure supply chain of some of the

330
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,680
basic building blocks of the bioeconomy

331
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,560
chemicals and and uh bi biological

332
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,800
components plasmas and and proteins

333
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,839
lipids that can power some of these more

334
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,440
advanced and exciting ideas that are uh

335
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,760
you know really at the heart of what's

336
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,800
in a number of different startup

337
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,000
companies and academic institutions

338
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
these

339
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:18,519
days so when we think about like how do

340
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,560
we transform this underlying Base today

341
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,000
we're sitting at this this standpoint

342
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,880
where we have you know very complex

343
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,639
largely manual uh and centralized

344
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,920
facilities that cost a lot to build out

345
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,040
and you know I think as we kind of

346
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,880
appreciate in order to scale up

347
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,600
production we really want to scale up

348
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,040
certain aspects that you know for

349
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
certain types of products it's going to

350
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
be necessary to go to very very large

351
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,000
scales in order to drop that denominator

352
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,760
in the economies of scale and so for

353
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,800
certain products like you commercial

354
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,959
scale you know Global Supply of certain

355
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,800
foods or materials this is going to be

356
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:53,279
very very important uh to be able to do

357
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,519
but the question is how do we innovate

358
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,959
fast in this this realm these are very

359
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,880
expensive facilities to build they take

360
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,560
a long time and they will take you know

361
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,079
they will basically be fit for purpose

362
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,560
for one use and so what we've kind of

363
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,639
been thinking a bit about and seeing uh

364
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,120
happen as a result of kind of movement

365
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:10,560
in other Industries we might look at

366
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,680
like additive manufacturing or even

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,199
inkjet printers as other examples of

368
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,160
distributed production small footprint

369
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,680
manufacturing that complements this kind

370
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,360
of very large scale uh represents a

371
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,880
really unique opportunity in the

372
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,360
biomanufacturing landscape to bring low

373
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,680
Capital expense uh entry points in for

374
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,120
small and medium Enterprises that are

375
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,399
trying to get started and to allow for

376
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,560
from vertical integration in this uh

377
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,720
particular uh sector these are going to

378
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,040
be absolutely dependent on a high degree

379
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,680
of automation uh but would enable kind

380
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,160
of pilot and entry new product

381
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,480
introductions uh and allow for you know

382
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,279
special use complex products things like

383
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,240
cell and Gene therapies that are you

384
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,680
know sort of a unique and special uh use

385
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,480
case so what would what would physically

386
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,079
technology-wise be necessary to

387
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,160
transform this uh you I've mentioned

388
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,320
doing more for Less we need the

389
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,199
processes to be continuous today as I

390
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,680
kind of showed you Manufacturing in this

391
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,560
industry is largely done in batch so

392
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,959
these are staged operations where you

393
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,399
transform from one to the other that

394
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,120
demands very large volumes by going to

395
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,759
continuous I can reduce my overall

396
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,600
footprint I can reduce the amount of

397
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,320
materials that I'm using there's also an

398
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,199
opportunity to switch to single use

399
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,240
these are disposable elements as opposed

400
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,600
to the stainless steel type tanks that I

401
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,040
showed you seems counterintuitive at

402
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,759
first but when you start to consider the

403
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,519
energy cost the chemical cost and the

404
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,040
water costs of actually cleaning those

405
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,880
stainless steel facilities in order to

406
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,959
uh remove any residuals from one product

407
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,120
to another one single use materials

408
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,079
become much more interesting and if you

409
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,880
combine that with as we're seeing across

410
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,720
some of the vendors now thinking about

411
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,839
bioplastics that are degradable suddenly

412
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,399
the footprint of being able to

413
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,199
manufacture by the biology even though

414
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,839
it's using a plastic base as opposed to

415
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,880
a chemical stainless steel base uh is

416
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,639
quite

417
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,240
compelling all of this means

418
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,959
intensification

419
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,399
uh reducing the total volume of the

420
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,839
facility itself the energy costs for the

421
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,800
HVAC in many of these facilities is 50%

422
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,199
of the carbon footprint so getting to

423
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
smaller and smaller facilities

424
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,000
facilitates that but the only way to get

425
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,480
to smaller of course is going to be to

426
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,680
automate some of those steps and to

427
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,040
remove barriers between

428
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,199
steps and we're already starting to see

429
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,079
this transition occur in a in a high

430
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,839
value industry this is occurring in the

431
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,079
biopharmaceutical space where they've

432
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,240
made the conscious decision over the

433
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,000
last 10 years to really move from fed

434
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,639
batch operations into single use

435
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,120
intensified continuous processing for

436
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,000
very specific applications like

437
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,000
monoclonal antibodies used in in uh

438
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,680
biopharmaceuticals but this chart kind

439
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,600
of gives you a sense of between the blue

440
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,120
arrow and yellow arrow the the real

441
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,399
saving and that present cost of being

442
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,440
able to stand up a new facility based on

443
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,639
these newer principles compared to more

444
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,399
traditional ones there's an opportunity

445
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,240
now for the other Industries in the

446
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,560
sector to really think deeply about how

447
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,319
they can also so achieve these economies

448
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,480
uh in in production uh cost but also uh

449
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,480
in in improving their

450
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,560
sustainability to kind of put all of

451
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,120
this in perspective and to show you kind

452
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,880
of technologically what a process like

453
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,120
this might look like today this is a

454
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,160
state-of-the-art continuous monoclonal

455
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,319
antibody production process there's a

456
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,800
bunch of blocks on here but effectively

457
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,519
you know you have cells in the top left

458
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,440
they produce the monoclonal antibody

459
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,920
that flows through all of the the green

460
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,120
lines through a number of different

461
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,759
steps into the bottom left where it says

462
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,800
bulk these are uh the individual steps

463
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,399
that are required to assure the safety

464
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,680
and sterility of the material that's

465
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,759
produced as well as to to to make it

466
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,880
efficacious but what's interesting is

467
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,800
this is where there's now an

468
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
intersection and convergence between the

469
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,880
biology and what we're learning on that

470
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,519
front and the engineering that I just

471
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,079
showed you the mechanical steps of

472
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,079
moving fluids around hosts the biology

473
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,040
for making things like proteins is

474
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,199
becoming a lot like software and we can

475
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,319
think about this a lot in the same uh

476
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,959
mindset I can have a a host maybe it's a

477
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,520
simple host a yeast that I can reprogram

478
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,760
based on reading its genome and writing

479
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,720
its genome to be able to do tasks that I

480
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,400
want make that monoclonal antibody make

481
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,839
a food protein make a fragrance uh make

482
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,000
a single cell protein for cattle feed

483
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,760
stocks these are all different tasks

484
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,160
that I might accomplish I can read and

485
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,559
write them now in very efficient ways uh

486
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,200
We've started a Consortium here at MIT

487
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,919
that is building some of these basic

488
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,520
building blocks uh we have a very

489
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,480
diverse membership as you can see from

490
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,960
biopharmaceutical companies to vendors

491
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,559
to uh companies that are interested in

492
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,080
very large scale uh protein production

493
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,679
and really trying to understand like

494
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,559
what are the key levers and how do we

495
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,480
start to build an open source platform

496
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,280
for advancing these types of biologies

497
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,640
in a new new

498
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,640
light and if you have these new

499
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,159
biologies as we're advancing in this

500
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,840
this particular area it allows you to

501
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,600
revisit some of that engineering mindset

502
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I've shown here what you could do if you

503
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,280
used an alternative biology to power

504
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,840
that same platform for protein

505
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,679
production I've cut out three or four

506
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,799
distinct key steps that are key cost

507
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,000
drivers reduce the complex ability

508
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,840
reduce the interfaces between it and

509
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,720
based on some modeling work that we've

510
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,120
done uh with a couple of our

511
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,960
biopharmaceutical company Partners we've

512
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,799
shown that actually getting to uh

513
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,799
similar cost targets is possible with

514
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,559
even less physical output from the

515
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,760
facility just because of the speed with

516
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,600
which some of these other Al biologies

517
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,600
operate and so you can start to really

518
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,159
shrink this thing down into a different

519
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
type of form factor and so our idea you

520
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,360
know one idea that we're we're exploring

521
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,880
is you could you build this to be

522
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,720
something that's easy as agile as

523
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
printing this is not to replace

524
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
centralized facilities but we all have

525
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,159
the experience of having a desktop

526
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,159
printer I have one here sitting next to

527
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,080
me it costs like 80 bucks and I can

528
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,840
print anything I want and when I'm done

529
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
printing something I can take that same

530
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,280
file and take it to the commercial

531
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,159
printer and print that exact same thing

532
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,559
how do we enable the bioeconomy by

533
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,520
building these this kind of uh simple

534
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,320
Technologies to facilitate that we had

535
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,159
an opportunity in MIT to build one such

536
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,080
system as a prototype system we built

537
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,520
and demonstrated a few years ago we

538
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,039
showed that we could use the same

539
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,919
physical system using that yeast toast

540
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,840
that I described a moment ago to produce

541
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,640
three different FDA approved

542
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,600
biopharmaceutical products all with

543
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,200
phase appropriate clinical grade quality

544
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,880
uh all in a fully automated and fully

545
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,400
hands-free manner we've now gone on and

546
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,400
made a number of different proteins on

547
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,480
this particular platform

548
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,520
uh and we're we moved this into a

549
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,039
company that's now starting to

550
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,520
commercialize this uh this is an example

551
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,919
of one of their systems here shown in

552
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,640
the picture at sunflower Therapeutics

553
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,559
where they're building you know GMP

554
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,360
grade versions of these kinds of

555
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,440
facilities they can fit in a small room

556
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,840
like an office space or seminar uh kind

557
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,320
of facility and what's cool is that each

558
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,039
one has the capability of making a set

559
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,400
of different products they showed during

560
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,919
the the pandemic that they could

561
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,799
actually produce a couple of different U

562
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,360
materials gcsf used a number of cancer

563
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,559
treatments and a covid-19 vaccine

564
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,000
subunit they were able to do all of this

565
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,240
with one of those systems like I showed

566
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,760
you in a warehouse that was not GMP

567
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,159
grade that was not you know something

568
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,799
that you would typically see in a biom

569
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,480
manufacturing space but uh met all of

570
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,640
the requirements to be clinical great

571
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,280
because it's fully closed and fully uh

572
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
you know automated in the way that it

573
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,080
operates so I think these are some of

574
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,360
the directions that are going to be

575
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,720
possible with these types of

576
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,000
Technologies and what you can now

577
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,400
imagine is as we think about Regional

578
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,559
innovation hubs how do we start to

579
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,919
enable a wide range of different

580
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,480
innovators to be able to plug into the

581
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:38,400
manufacturing uh to be able to

582
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,840
facilitate their ideas for the

583
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,559
bioeconomy uh these types of low

584
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,320
footprint uh small footprint

585
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,240
manufacturing Solutions are now

586
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
available for a wide different range of

587
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,000
different um types of products I've

588
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,720
showed you one for proteins but there's

589
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
ones for small molecules mRNA and cells

590
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
and so we think that not only does this

591
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,080
address sort of the robustness but it

592
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,720
also adds a strong complement to the

593
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,679
base in thinking about how do we enable

594
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,679
more products into the

595
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,720
bioeconomy there is still work to be

596
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,679
done and I'll just highlight here the

597
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,720
last couple of slides here that that the

598
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,919
science of the biomanufacturing itself

599
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,559
still needs a lot of work we as a nation

600
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,919
have spent a lot of time thinking about

601
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,480
the front end of biotechnology how do we

602
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,080
build new drugs how do we build new

603
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,120
products uh how do we engineer the

604
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,400
organisms we spend less time thinking

605
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,039
about the scaling of that particular

606
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,120
question and outline here a few

607
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,320
different topics that I think are

608
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,679
critical in being able to build those

609
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,760
Next Generation facilities that are

610
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,600
going to be able to meet the cost

611
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,240
targets and such uh but what's

612
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,679
encouraging is even those models that I

613
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,960
showed you for small footprint the costs

614
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,799
per gram because they're highly

615
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,240
automated and use very little labor can

616
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,400
be very equivalent to large volume

617
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,080
manufacturing uh at certain inflection

618
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,640
points this certainly works in the

619
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,919
biopharmaceutical space and now the

620
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,400
opportunity is to bring some of those

621
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,120
ideas into some of these other ones

622
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,799
where we have to drive the cost of

623
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,120
production down even further so I'll

624
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,919
stop here and I'll just you know I just

625
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,640
encourage you I think as we think about

626
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
what the bioeconomy means it really is

627
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,039
going to mean Transforming Our biom

628
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
manufacturing approach and if we can

629
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,760
make it more accessible we can really

630
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,360
Empower circular bioeconomies to occur

631
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,360
at really any scale of our economy and

632
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,320
ultimately lead to larger uh more

633
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,480
sustainable uh infrastructure thanks for

634
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,080
the time Ben and look forward to uh to

635
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,600
the panel discussion

636
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
later great thanks so much Chris and and

637
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,320
we'll be sure if you have any questions

638
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,240
for for Chris please put them in the

639
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,240
chat we can revisit in the panel
