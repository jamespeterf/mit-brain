1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,120
Hi. So, yes. So, I'm Kathleen Kennedy

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,120
and I work now at Open Learning,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,679
although I used to work with David at

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,320
technology review. So, it was really fun

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,800
to see that. I'm going to talk to you

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,960
about a new initiative that we're doing

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,920
over at Open Learning. But before I jump

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,119
into that, I want to ask how many people

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,039
in this room are MIT alumni? How many

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:32,800
people went to school at MIT?

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,800
Ah, so like maybe 5%. That's really

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,840
interesting. So I'm going to guess that

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,040
the rest of you come here to hear

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,760
conversations like this, to learn new

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,520
things, to figure out what's going on in

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,879
the world and how do we make sense of

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,559
it, right? MIT is really good at that.

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,600
And we're also really good at figuring

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,680
out new technologies. So MIT Open

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,960
Learning, let me level set about what we

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,159
do at MIT Open Learning. So we basically

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,479
take right the MIT mission of advancing

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,400
science and technology and creating

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,600
really really smart people that are

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,600
changing the world. We look at how can

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,240
we do that in our industry which is

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,880
education and how can we push the

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
boundaries and innovate in the education

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,479
space.

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,119
Let me take you through a little

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,000
timeline. So I've been at MIT for 25

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,720
years and so like I love looking at

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,960
something like this and seeing you know

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,640
what are the things that we have done.

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:43,200
So MIT became the first institute of

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,159
higher education to offer free education

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,880
for the world. Right? So we opened up

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
what it is that we do and made it free

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,720
to everyone. That was with something

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,680
called OCW.

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,840
Fast forward to 2011 2012 we created

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
actually an a group that was going to do

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,799
that not just creating muks but

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,800
basically looking at how do we really

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,280
innovative in this space of education

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,680
then in 2015

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,760
on the solve stage I don't know if any

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
of you have ever heard of MIT solve but

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
it's something that we actually launched

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,200
at technology review and then and then

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
spun it out for the whole institute

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,360
um that

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
education was one of the key aspects of

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,680
the things that we did. So we w launched

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,160
that there. Then in 2019, we launched a

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
program that I now lead called MIT

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,239
Horizon. That is an enterprise level

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,440
content library and way that we can

59
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,519
bring emerging technologies to everyone

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,920
in the world to understand what do they

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,560
do and that's specifically fine-tuned

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,800
for large organizations.

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
In 2020, we launched something called

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,879
the DCC, which is looking at how do we

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,040
do digital credentials in new ways.

66
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,280
And then what I'm here to talk to you

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,680
about today, what we're really excited

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,879
about is how do we bring MIT

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,680
to everyone in the world?

70
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,560
How do we deliver personalized learning

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,319
for a billion people powered by MIT,

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
powered by AI?

73
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,000
built by MIT and you think maybe we

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,360
built AI too. We'll see. We are building

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,159
a lot of AI around to power this. So

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,680
this summer we launched something called

77
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,640
MIT Learn which is a new front door for

78
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,000
all of the education things that you can

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,280
do with MIT. So everything that is not

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,360
being a student at MIT,

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,319
executive education,

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,920
open courseware, lifelong learning and

83
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,400
basically you can see on any MIT page

84
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,879
there's a footer now called lifelong

85
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,720
learning. So how do you do this with

86
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,879
MIT? So it's a singular destination that

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,040
we've basically brought together all of

88
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,400
the offerings that we have across the

89
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,920
institute to help you understand how

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,239
does AI work? How do you use it? How do

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,799
you become sort of a leader in supply

92
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,720
chain? How do you how do you like

93
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,520
understand a lot of the things that you

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,240
just heard at this panel and are hearing

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,479
throughout this conference today? Now,

96
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,880
we are adding a lot of really cool

97
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,759
things in doing this. One of them is

98
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,759
called Ask Tim. So, you can sort of

99
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,880
figure that out. That's MIT backwards.

100
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:45,040
Tim is MIT's mascot. And we've actually

101
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:49,199
created MIT mascots for our online

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,360
learning. So, they're AI tools. So,

103
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,080
we've got a number of Ask Tims on the

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,360
site now that are that are different

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,040
fine-tuned AI GPTs that we've built for

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,880
all of this content. So, basically, how

107
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,680
do you have a guidance system on what

108
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,080
you need to to learn next or what do you

109
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
choose to do?

110
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,880
How do you go deeper in understanding

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,600
what the different things are? How do

112
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,120
you have a TA, your own personal

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,280
teaching assistant to help you to learn

114
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,840
what you're doing? And then how do you

115
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,280
have your own tutor? Right? So instead

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,759
of like having to depend on a human to

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,800
do things, we've got a fine-tuned AI

118
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,520
that is doing that for all of our new

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,039
learning materials. Now, what's very

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,840
exciting is what we're building next. So

121
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,759
to truly be able to deliver personalized

122
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,360
learning and to be able to deliver on

123
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:51,120
this mission, we are figuring out how to

124
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,560
do holistic assessments on all kinds of

125
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,840
learning so that you really understand

126
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,120
how someone's truly following the

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,039
program. How to do translation, right? I

128
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,680
would imagine this is a very global

129
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,919
group. How do we how do we deliver

130
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,039
things in

131
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,759
20 40 any language, right? And how can

132
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,919
we do that instantaneously?

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
How do we deliver it in a a perfectly

134
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
mobile friendly way? Now, we mostly

135
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,199
already do that, but we know a lot of

136
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,680
the world that's what they use.

137
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,360
And then how do we do this personalized

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,560
instruction? like how do we get to what

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,520
every single one of you in this audience

140
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,479
how do we deliver just for you what you

141
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,880
want so that's what we've got some

142
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,080
really smart MIT students and faculty

143
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,360
working on so Dmitri Bert Seamus is the

144
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,199
associate provost of open learning and

145
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
let me just show you a few things that

146
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,319
that he and his students are working on

147
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,600
so first is thinking about online

148
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,039
learners all all of You have different

149
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,080
things that you want, different

150
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:06,000
interests, backgrounds, goals, right?

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,039
So, how do we deliver what you want?

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,360
Then secondly, each of you learn

153
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,160
differently. Some of you like listening

154
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,039
to people talk, some people like reading

155
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,599
things, some people like doing, right?

156
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,479
So, everyone learns in different ways.

157
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,160
So, how do we help with the time that

158
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,440
you have, the pace, all of these

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,759
different aspects about things?

160
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,759
So right now

161
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,639
online learning is sort of one

162
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,199
sizefits-all right so you have

163
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,120
>> let me give you some of the details of

164
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:46,240
multiple linear regression model we are

165
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:50,080
given data of the dependent variable y I

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,400
the price realization of auction I and

167
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,680
independent variables

168
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:01,520
x subscript i

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Okay, MIT class, MIT level learning

170
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
brought to you from an MIT professor.

171
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,879
That's one way of doing it. And he's

172
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,800
it's a one to many, one-sizefits-all.

173
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,960
But you're in the healthcare industry.

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,800
That example didn't make sense to you.

175
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,319
We have a a way to be able to turn that

176
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
lecture

177
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,800
into

178
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,400
different examples so it could be

179
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,800
customized in real time for a different

180
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,960
industry. Right? Then it can be

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,919
customized for length. So

182
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
>> 30 second summary.

183
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,959
>> There you go.

184
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,279
>> We model log wine price as yi= beta plus

185
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,320
beta 1 x1 plus e fitted by minimizing

186
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,279
the sum of squared errors. SSE R² equals

187
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,600
1 my S SSE SST measures how much better

188
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,519
we do than predicting.

189
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,519
>> Now imagine that we want that

190
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,120
And then imagine that you are a student

191
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,519
and you got this question wrong.

192
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,080
How do we have a personalized tutor that

193
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,360
is going to give you the right answer?

194
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,880
Imagine that there's someone talking

195
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,240
right there and telling you what the

196
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,720
right answer is. So, there's going to be

197
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,040
also ways that you can this can be

198
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,519
customized very easily and quickly using

199
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,000
a back-end system of how we're doing

200
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,480
this because we're also developing this

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,040
not only for the world, but we're

202
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,519
actually building tools that all of our

203
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,600
MIT faculty can use and then we're

204
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,720
working with partner organizations all

205
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,120
around the world to bring this new type

206
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,680
of learning that is personalized for

207
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,440
everyone. on to do. So what we're

208
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,399
looking to do is actually bring learning

209
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,080
right now MIT students are one in a

210
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,920
million that in fact we want to deliver

211
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,560
MIT

212
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,959
learning to one in seven people in the

213
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,600
world. So we would love it if you joined

214
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,399
us. We've got a table in the next room.

215
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,959
Come check us out and thank you. Enjoy

216
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,959
