1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,119
All right. It is the last session. You

2
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,680
have survived the first day almost.

3
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,800
And

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,399
I'm really excited about this session uh

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,800
because we started the day we started

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,480
the day looking at the planetary scale

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,960
and

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,440
honestly from a little bit of a a

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,239
slightly grim perspective. I don't think

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,320
anyone left that session feeling really

11
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,079
light and excited about the state of the

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,440
world.

13
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,199
Um so now we proceeded to talk about

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,640
people because no change happens without

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,879
people and then about what people can do

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,799
in set rules policy and now we are going

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,960
to go ahead and go back to the scale

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,680
question but from the perspective

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,479
of with people with technology with

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,600
ideas with rules

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,600
what can we accomplish?

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
Um, so I hope we're going to end the day

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,240
with a lot of excitement. Um, and we

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,240
also have two um relatively new friends

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,360
of mine who I deeply admire and I'm

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,040
excited to have joining us. Both not

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,840
present. So we have two videos

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,360
sandwiching our our session today. Um,

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,840
and I am going to start with one uh the

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
growth of gens in Europe. Sanjie Kumar

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,439
is joining us I believe. Are you in

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,799
Brussels Sanjie? Yes, I am. Lovely.

33
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,799
Lovely evening in Brussels. You're

34
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,439
>> you lovely to see you up there.

35
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
>> Uh and I am going to ask you to

36
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,399
introduce yourself to everyone and then

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
go ahead and proceed with your

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
presentation.

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,080
>> Brilliant. Thank you. Thank you so much

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,239
Z. Firstly for the kind introduction and

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
for the the opportunity to come and uh

42
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,720
talk to everybody in the room. Um my

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
name is Sanjikuma.

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,959
I'm the head of policy at the European

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,120
Geothermal Energy Council, which means

46
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,000
that my role is to really grow markets

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
for geothermal across Europe. Um, that's

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,120
the European Union, but also countries

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,480
outside such as, um, uh, Iceland,

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,800
Norway, uh, down to Turkey, the Western

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,239
Balkans, and Ukraine. So, I look at what

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
are the regulatory frameworks, what are

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,280
the financial structures that we need to

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,840
grow geothermal. And what I'm going to

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,160
do is kind of share some of the

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,560
experiences that we've had in Europe.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,440
Um, let me start off with some pretty uh

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,080
basic uh things about uh the kind of the

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,360
content of Europe. Um, and then I'm

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
going to kind of give you some ideas

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
about how you can perhaps build upon the

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
session that you've had before the

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
discussions you've had uh this morning

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,360
and then the discussions you're going to

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,840
have um uh tomorrow. So let's start off

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,840
with some basics. uh there about Europe

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,840
is uh generally um our um heat gradient

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
is quite low. We have lower temperatures

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
so we don't have a lot of power

70
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,760
generation. Uh what we do have is a lot

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
of heating. Um our market is geared

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
towards heating and that heat market is

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,360
transitioning. As it stands at the

74
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,599
moment there are about 10 million people

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
across Europe who benefit from different

76
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,799
types of geothermal heat pumps. These

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,599
are small uh closed loop systems to uh

78
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,200
large openloop systems. uh we have

79
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,239
district heating uh direct use um and

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,599
that's really for uh cities. We also in

81
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,840
a few countries have a lot of district

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,319
heating systems just for the agriculture

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
community. So when it comes to thinking

84
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
about your your doing new kind of

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,280
customer base I know a lot of the

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,599
conversation is going to be around

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,120
residential consumers. There is a whole

88
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,280
world outside the residential space. Um

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,159
and people like farmers we found in

90
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
Europe are very very vocal and generally

91
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,080
tend to get their own way. So and they

92
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
have a desire to have a permanent supply

93
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,480
of heating and cooling. So it's a

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,319
fantastic customer base. Factories.

95
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,879
There's some of the big car makers in

96
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,519
Europe have just uh uh installed

97
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,759
geothermal heating and cooling systems

98
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,919
um uh for their uh for their factories,

99
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
for their head offices. It's it's really

100
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,720
big. And of course, we've got 11 million

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,720
consumers tapped into geothermal power.

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,479
Um, but what I want to do is just to

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
deep dive a little bit into what the

104
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,680
situation in Europe is, why it's perhaps

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,280
different to the US, but the challenges

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
that we face are the same challenges

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,840
that you're going to face as you start

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,160
to scale up uh geothermal in particular,

109
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,160
especially network geothermal. So, let's

110
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
start off with some basics. Um like

111
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,360
everywhere else in the world, the bulk

112
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,759
of our heating and cooling supply is

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
fossilbased. Um where we have

114
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,639
non-fossilbased heating cooling, it's

115
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,360
largely coming from combustible biomass.

116
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,919
Um and over the last five or six years,

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,440
there's been a quite a ugly discussion

118
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,759
around toning down the amount of biomass

119
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,759
uh to just focusing on that can be that

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,080
which can be sustainably sourced. And

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,320
what that's effectively done is put a

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,479
ceiling on the amount of biomass we're

123
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,320
going to use uh in heating. So the

124
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
growth market that they've had in the

125
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
past is going to start to diminish. And

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,120
what that's really doing is it's kind of

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,199
paving the way for um heat pumps um and

128
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,120
for kind of direct use geothermal. And

129
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,120
when we talk about heat pumps in a

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
European context, almost everybody

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,759
thinks of airsource heat pumps. So the

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,759
language that we use to describe uh

133
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,680
electric heating with uh ground source

134
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
heat pumps, geothermal heat pumps is

135
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
something we're going to come back to

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,000
later on. We also have a legacy system

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,320
of district heating. So, a lot of these

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,479
are in former Soviet countries, but you

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,120
also have them in Baltic places, sorry,

140
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,199
in the Scandinavian countries such as

141
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,000
Denmark um and Finland um uh where you

142
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,479
have effectively heat networks that were

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,560
built on the back of a a coal plant, a

144
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,400
gas plant or a waste incineration plant,

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
and you take the excess heat and you

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,840
pump it at high temperatures at vast

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,880
quantities through um a network. Um

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,280
these are extremely inefficient. They're

149
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,199
very very polluting. And what's been

150
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,000
happening over the last 20 years is that

151
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,600
people have just been jumping using uh

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,520
things like airsource heat pumps,

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,360
geothermal heat pumps to get themselves

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,600
off of these district heating systems.

155
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,840
So this industry has a tarnished

156
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
reputation. But if we're serious about

157
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,919
decarbonization, we're going to have to

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,120
rethink uh district heating and cooling

159
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,199
systems. And this becomes really

160
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,639
important to you. So it's within that

161
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,120
context of a multitude of supplies. um

162
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,280
renewable energies incumbent fossils

163
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,400
that network geothermal has to operate

164
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,440
in. So that's our competition base. Um

165
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,919
the other thing which is quite important

166
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,560
to us and will become an issue for you

167
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,960
later on um is the fact that we have a

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
largely densely populated uh

169
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
geographical spaces. So we don't have

170
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,800
vast lands in which we can do drilling

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,199
and great uh um uh big uh uh uh

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,919
networks. we have to operate in tightly

173
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,960
confined spaces. Um, and environmental

174
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,360
protection is absolutely key. And what

175
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,759
we found is is that as the geothermal

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,120
sector grows, the regulators,

177
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,520
particularly those that are looking at

178
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,400
protecting water,

179
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,560
drinking water, surface water, those

180
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,479
that are very very nervous about uh kind

181
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
of geothermal activities around them,

182
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
but also are very concerned and are

183
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,599
driven by the perception of negative

184
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,680
impacts. This has in some cases slowed

185
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,759
down a lot of growth that we've seen in

186
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
in some of the the really advancing

187
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,520
countries such as the Netherlands where

188
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,319
now it's much harder to for us to get a

189
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,879
permit. So permitting becomes an issue

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,160
once you start to see a a reasonable

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,960
size of growth um within uh your

192
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,599
geothermal systems. The other two things

193
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,280
from this one um is that when we often

194
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,680
talk about geothermal in a European

195
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,759
context, you can see from the three uh

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,000
different types of uh geothermal heat

197
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,240
pumps that we tend to focus on the first

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,599
two. Um so vertical ball holds or uh two

199
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,319
vertical ball holds linked to a

200
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,080
hydrothermal source. The the the example

201
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,000
that you have at the end with a loop

202
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,520
that's quite shallow, there's just not

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
enough space for that to really operate

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,240
in a European context. So that means

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,800
that we are looking at deeper pipes of

206
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,279
drilling much more sophisticated

207
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,200
uh and access to land that becomes more

208
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,760
important as well as being able to get

209
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,880
drilling rigs into uh people's gardens

210
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,800
or whole uh down streets. One of the

211
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
other things that's happened is in a few

212
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,920
countries where the market has started

213
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,920
to grow and it hasn't been regulated. Um

214
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,160
we've had the issue of thermal

215
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
interference where people have been kind

216
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,160
of installing geothermal heat pumps in

217
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,480
their back gardens but they're too close

218
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,720
to somebody else's back garden and what

219
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
you do then is they install a heat pump

220
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,200
a geothermal heat pump and you're

221
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,120
effectively diminishing the the overall

222
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,560
thermal efficiency of that one. there's

223
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,440
le lawsuits in Ireland uh for example it

224
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,360
kind of again dampened down uh the

225
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
growth in that market. So these are the

226
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,600
kind of things that you're going to have

227
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
to start to think through and for us the

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
the the most important issue becomes

229
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
permitting. Um you can see from the the

230
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,480
map at the bottom that's a map of France

231
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,920
at a 100 meter depth. um all the areas

232
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
where if you're going to install a

233
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
geothermal heat pump, the zones in

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
green, you just have to do a simple

235
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,360
email to your local government just to

236
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,320
say, "Hey, this is where I'm installing

237
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
my uh ball hole. Uh this is how this is

238
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,839
the kind of depth it's going to be. Um

239
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,839
and this is the kind of the geoloccation

240
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
as possibly

241
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,320
get it. Um and then that can be noted

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,160
somewhere in a registry so that later on

243
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
in maybe 1015 years time if somebody

244
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,080
else wants to plot something they can

245
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
very quickly check and see if there's

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
going to be any kind of uh negative

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,959
impact on any additional systems coming

248
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,480
on. Then you have orange areas. Orange

249
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,480
areas are sensitive subsurface activity

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,200
and you need to get some form of an

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,640
external recognition. Again this is for

252
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,920
like a 100 m 200 m depth. there needs to

253
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,680
be some form of third party assessment.

254
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
And then the red areas are really where

255
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,040
you need to have a full environmental

256
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,240
impact assessment. They're very

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,519
sensitive areas. Um and you can see that

258
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,720
the what the kind of the the

259
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,800
congregation of red dots um uh on the um

260
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,200
on the eastern part of France is the

261
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Alsas region and the Alsas region is a

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,079
volcanic uh region. There have been

263
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,560
examples where people have drilled uh uh

264
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,720
geothermal heat pumps and in one case

265
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
actually uh damaged eight or nine

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,519
properties within a village and that led

267
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,880
to a variety of lawsuits um and really

268
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,560
did give a negative impression to

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
geothermal even though France is one of

270
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,120
those countries that's really gung-ho um

271
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,279
in our SAS the mayor of ours all of them

272
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,519
don't like geothermal and they lump all

273
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,959
geothermal into this uh basket so we

274
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
need to be very very sensitive around

275
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,320
the environmental impacts as your market

276
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,839
starts to grow. Um, just a kind of quick

277
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
thing, I I noticed you might not be able

278
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
to see this graphic clearly, but you can

279
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,760
blow up the screen when you get the the

280
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,480
slides. Uh, Sweden is the largest

281
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,440
country in terms of installed capacity.

282
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,040
Germany second, uh, France is third. But

283
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
really, the countries to look at if

284
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
you're going to look at them are

285
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,959
Belgium, the Netherlands, and Poland.

286
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,680
These these really have grown uh roughly

287
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,360
over the last decade. is a new entrance

288
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,279
and that that's where all the innovation

289
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,040
is happening and part of the innovation

290
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,880
story in a country like Belgium is

291
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,959
around network geos. I'm going to come

292
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,519
on to that later on as to why that's the

293
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,000
case. Um and then what you can see here

294
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,240
is is on the figure 14 is the kind of

295
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,079
the density of heat pumps uh per

296
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,880
thousand households. So again Sweden is

297
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,800
the most populous country. In Sweden,

298
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,519
home buyers generally tend to look at

299
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,600
five criteria uh when they're purchasing

300
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
a new property, and a geothermal heat

301
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
pump is normally the fourth orif fifth

302
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,600
thing that they look at. Um before the

303
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,160
construction industry collapsed in

304
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,959
around 2000 2020, um geothermal houses

305
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,160
with geothermal heat pumps sold for 12

306
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,839
to 15,000 euros more than houses that

307
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,160
didn't. Um, so there was a clear

308
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,480
recognition in a mature market that this

309
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,399
really does add value to your property.

310
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,720
Um, we haven't quite seen that in other

311
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,560
countries, but as they start to grow and

312
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,200
they become much more populous, we

313
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,519
expect this to be the Estonia to be the

314
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,839
next big country. Um, where you've got a

315
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,079
lot of geothermal heat pumps in there.

316
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,279
Um now what's happened is is that you've

317
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,320
had kind of conventional story around

318
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,320
district heating and uh um uh geothermal

319
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,880
heat pumps and then out of nowhere

320
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,279
network GFL came onto the scene and they

321
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,040
were young and sexy and fresh and

322
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,800
everyone's like oh my god I need to have

323
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:06,000
this. Um but this has come uh really

324
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,480
from three uh angles. So the first angle

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
is is that district heating, you had a

326
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
lot of people leaving district heating

327
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240
systems and what you started to find is

328
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,839
that they were in communities and once

329
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,839
you start to take a community off a

330
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,760
district heating system, the overall

331
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,360
cost profile and the efficiency of that

332
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,800
district heating system become a

333
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,240
problem. Um so it's it's caused negative

334
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,560
tension with the district heating

335
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,639
community. On the other hand, you've had

336
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,720
lots of uh people who were looking at

337
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
doing their own individual installation

338
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,440
and then they suddenly realized well

339
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
actually we can band together and create

340
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
a community energy scheme. And in a

341
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,800
country like Belgium, community energy

342
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,639
is really the thing that's driving uh

343
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,560
this push towards network geothermal.

344
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,560
It's not just communities. It's, you

345
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,320
know, property developers. It's rural

346
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,240
communities. It's a variety of people

347
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,320
just saying, "Look, it makes sense for

348
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,160
us to work together to build a common

349
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,399
infrastructure because then it's so much

350
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,240
cheaper." And just for full disclosure,

351
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm trying to set one up in my street. I

352
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
live opposite the school. I want the

353
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,240
school to to have all the bore holes and

354
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,440
for us to pay a small fee to connect to

355
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,040
their system. I've got um of uh of the

356
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,040
72 uh houses in my uh uh in my my two

357
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,399
blocks, we've got 30. so far who were

358
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,680
keen. We need to get everyone else on

359
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,760
board and then we need to lobby the

360
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,399
school to agree to do this one and get

361
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,600
some way in which we can finance it. But

362
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,680
you know individual installations are

363
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,839
not the default option anymore. People

364
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
want to be part of a um a collective

365
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,079
system. It's part of the normalization

366
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,600
of the technology as well. And then the

367
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,040
third element and I'm going to spend a

368
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,720
bit of time on this later on is the

369
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,760
planning aspect because Europe has been

370
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,600
heavily dependent upon imported gas and

371
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,000
the crisis that happened after Ukraine

372
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,440
was invaded. Uh the kind of response was

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,079
saying okay well we need to make someone

374
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
responsible for planning a transition.

375
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,360
Um and you know whilst you'll have all

376
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,800
the kind of campaigners saying look the

377
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,680
revolution is going to be exciting.

378
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,160
We're going to be manning the

379
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,079
barricades. It's not true. The energy

380
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,800
revolution is all about logistics and

381
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,839
planning and finance. That's all it is.

382
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,079
Um I can see Hela smiling K

383
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
on this point, but it really is that

384
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,680
pedantic. You need to know, you need to

385
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,839
get out maps of streets and start

386
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,320
working out well actually what parts can

387
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,079
we convert quickly who goes first, who

388
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
goes second, who goes third. But more

389
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,120
importantly, who makes those decisions?

390
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,279
So let me give you some examples to kind

391
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
of illustrate this transition. and and

392
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,320
Sanjie, I'm gonna I'm gonna briefly say

393
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,240
because you're on the screen that um a

394
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,959
couple minutes for the examples would be

395
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
wonderful. Thank you.

396
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,000
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, no, I I'm gonna race

397
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,360
through these ones. In fact, I'll just

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,920
give you one example here. Enfield

399
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Council, this is a local authority. They

400
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,160
converted to geothermal not because they

401
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,480
loved their network geothermal, but

402
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
because their uh the people who were

403
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
living in the four tower blocks, you can

404
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,199
see two of them behind you. they were

405
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,360
massively massively indebted in terms of

406
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,399
their energy costs. So they had a social

407
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,320
political crisis. Um they looked at all

408
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
sorts of options and opted for network

409
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,720
geothermal. Instead of refurbishing one

410
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,399
building and one building block by by

411
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,160
block, what they decided to do was all

412
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,920
four of them in one go. And then you got

413
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,920
the real system efficiencies kicking

414
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,199
through. And you can see the savings,

415
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,440
you know, between 450 to 700 pounds per

416
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,040
year uh depending on the residents. to

417
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
the energy consumption within those

418
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,480
buildings. This is my favorite project

419
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,199
simply because this is in the heart of

420
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,519
Brussels and it proves that where you

421
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,360
have listed buildings, you can actually

422
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,199
do geothermal projects and that's part

423
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,720
of the sexy thing about it and that's

424
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
really where network geothermal has

425
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,800
kicked off in Brussels. Our SPA hospital

426
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,800
is a 16th century uh site. You cannot

427
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,519
touch this building place at all.

428
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,560
There's a huge complex of uh uh schools.

429
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,240
It's a UNUSCO heritage site. geothermal

430
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,240
was the only option and rather than

431
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,839
doing individual ground source heat

432
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,959
pumps creating the heat network was

433
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
really where you got the system

434
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,800
efficiencies coming through the biggest

435
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,160
project in Spain this is really what I

436
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,199
want to talk to you about couple of

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,199
things policy matters now um what's

438
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,959
absolutely essential is that even if

439
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,039
geothermal isn't mentioned in the first

440
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,120
round of policy once you start to get

441
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,640
people thinking about what zero looks

442
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,199
like what a fully renewable system uh uh

443
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,959
uh uh could be they'll almost always

444
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,880
come and discover geothermal and then

445
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,120
they'll start complaining by saying why

446
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,120
didn't you tell us this existed before

447
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
and what happened in Wunia which is a

448
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,080
small part of Belgium um is they

449
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,000
invested just put 35 million euros up

450
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,400
front for some very basic grants they

451
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,720
did a lot of iconic projects but more

452
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
importantly you had Carlo the energy

453
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,559
company all of a sudden become a

454
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,799
national champion in network geothermal

455
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,960
and Resiolia who were the engineering

456
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,120
design company are now winning contracts

457
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,039
all across Europe so there's an

458
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,520
industrial policy story more than just

459
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,520
the energy savings but what I said

460
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,679
earlier the planning bit is absolutely

461
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,760
essential and the two key things in the

462
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,440
planning bit is to make sure that

463
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,080
whenever you're conducting a plan it has

464
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,320
to be based on local renewable energy

465
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,080
supplies if you take those two words out

466
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
of it you will end up with you know

467
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,240
biomass you'll end up with a variety of

468
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,679
you know Frankenstein solutions if you

469
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,600
want to keep it towards geothermal

470
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,640
you've got to focus on the locality and

471
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,120
the renewable aspect around it But

472
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,280
really what's super pertinent around

473
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,600
this is the the fact that words matter.

474
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,360
So when we describe uh network

475
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,280
geothermal, the reason why we'd say

476
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,919
network geothermal and not fifth

477
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,720
generation district heating or network

478
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,240
uh uh uh sorry heat pump networks is

479
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,840
that they don't have the word geothermal

480
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,520
in. And if you don't have the word

481
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,120
geothermal, you're going to miss all of

482
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,320
the things that you need to go through

483
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,600
to get to the network geothermal system.

484
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,440
Always focus on who makes the

485
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,799
investment. So in the some of the

486
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,039
examples I've showed you, it's the local

487
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,280
government, it's a community, it's a

488
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,880
property developer, their needs are

489
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,960
completely different, but the way in

490
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,880
which they access finance is also

491
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,840
completely different. So it changes the

492
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,160
gambit. Um business models are the most

493
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,760
important thing. It's not about can you

494
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,080
do the project, it's about how do you

495
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,400
make it profitable for everybody and

496
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
that's where the innovation around you

497
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,640
know whether you have an onbalance or

498
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,880
offbalance sheet. um what's the size and

499
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,480
the length of the project? How do you

500
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,039
build in the modules? How do you kind of

501
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,880
seg uh disagregate the different prices

502
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,080
that people pay? This is the most

503
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,640
important thing when it comes to

504
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,280
designing a system at scale.

505
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
Uh super important drilling is sexy. So

506
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,039
whilst everyone talks about the energy

507
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,080
savings, the greenhouse gas emission

508
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,679
reductions, that's great, but in the

509
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,799
geothermal world, once you've done an

510
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,960
installation, you will not see

511
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,600
geothermal ever again. apart from two

512
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,640
black pipes coming out into a into your

513
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
heat pump.

514
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,559
>> So, the drilling bit is where you get

515
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
people attracted.

516
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,400
>> Two more things, super important. You've

517
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,799
got to have more and more people

518
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,039
providing the service of uh designing

519
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,720
and install installation. The more you

520
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,200
do that, the more competitive the price

521
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,280
becomes, the more you start to get

522
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
suppliers chasing markets. And this is

523
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,480
really the space we want to get to. And

524
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,600
then the final thing is is that whilst

525
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,400
we talk about the energy service

526
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,559
delivery, the real political win is an

527
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,280
industrial policy. Can you set up

528
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,559
manufacturing uh uh any part of the

529
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,400
component features? Can you create

530
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,559
companies with design experts or

531
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,080
training experts or drilling experts?

532
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,360
That's where you get the real value for

533
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,440
money. That's where the competitions

534
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,760
really start to wake up. So on that

535
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,560
note, think global,

536
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
think global, go.

537
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,320
[Laughter]

538
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,720
>> Thank you. Thank you, Sanjief. And I I I

539
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
see that you uh your previous slide you

540
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,320
apparently agree with our

541
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:45,000
administration's drill baby drill. Um

542
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,000
so thank you for covering so much.
