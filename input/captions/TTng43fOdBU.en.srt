19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,559
she says we tend to be siloed at MIT and

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,719
don't talk enough to people in the real

social political and economic realities

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,080
leading change is difficult requiring

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,640
different strategies for different

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,080

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,600
students to believe they could lead

Andrea Christina Ruiz signed up for the

52
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,119
IP class to get a survey understanding

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
of the different lenses that could be

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,560
applied to understand the energy

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,720

59
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,800
course Ruiz was charged with advancing

60
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,080
the use of evidence and promoting

61
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,000
evidence-based policymaking toward

change policies and interventions

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I wanted to see where the gears are

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,319
turning in scientific technological and

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,760
other communities which are all part of

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,560
the solution to understand how I fit in

68
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,959
says Ruiz who is now an economist at the

71
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,959
interdisciplinary nuanced and holistic

72
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,959
take on key challenges in the energy

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
transition a transition that is

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,400
essential if we want to avert the worst

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,120
impacts of climate change she says some

76
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,640
of the insights she found particularly

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,799
useful came came from emray genser a

78
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,720
mighty research scientist who weighs the

79
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,280
costs and benefits of new carbon

80
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,080
reducing Technologies based on Cradle to

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,000
grave emissions in his presentation

82
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,760
genser outlined the importance of moving

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,440
as swiftly as possible to an all

84
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,599
electric vehicle Fleet we must

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,280
immediately cut emissions but how we get

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,120
there is very important he said instead

87
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,400
of waiting until we have widespread

88
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,159
electric charging infrastructure we can

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,200
switch from internal combustion engine

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,599
vehicles icevs to plug in hybrids or

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,640
hybrids immediately he also proposed

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,840
Banning

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,000
ICS in another session Christopher kidle

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,280
the George P Schultz professor of energy

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,599
economics at the MIT Sloan School of

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,080
Management and deputy director for

97
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,959
policy at Mighty discussed policy

98
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,280
options for driving the energy

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,840
transition climate change represents a

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,200
case where markets don't work well he

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,120
noted pointing to persistent resistance

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
to the idea of a carbon tax saving the

103
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,920
planet will mean paying more for clean

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,760
energy so Distributing this burden

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,920
equitably will be Central to any

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,360
successful policy kidle suggested I care

107
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,400
deeply not just about efficiency but

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,680
about the winners and losers associated

109
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,199
with climate change policy kidle

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,400
said he shared research demonstrating

111
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,400
that a small carbon tax whose Dividends

112
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,440
are distributed to the most economically

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,639
vulnerable in society could have an

114
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,520
outsized and Rapid impact on emissions

115
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,960
these presentations made the dimensions

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,240
of the climate change problem more

117
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,280
accessible says say Ruiz I'm not an

118
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,000
expert on decarbonization or

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,360
electrification but knowing what

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,080
policies exist and what economic models

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,479
can be used will help me ask the right

122
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,000
question she

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,479
says finding a

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,440
balance leading the energy transition

125
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,759
Drew several hundred participants over

126
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,560
the duration of the course from current

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
MIT students and MIT alumni to globally

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,520
based students and professionals eager

129
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,759
to glean ideas for their studies and

130
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,360
careers in core centry surveys many

131
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,600
noted their desire to accelerate the

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,720
energy transition and identified

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,160
specific interests and economically and

134
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,440
politically feasible paths for

135
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,639
decarbonizing the electric grid

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,320
commercializing nuclear fusion and

137
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,199
achieving climate Justice some students

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,919
thought a sense of the speaker personal

139
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,560
experiences managing their day-to-day

140
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,880
responsibilities and

141
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,000
expectations what tactics do you find to

142
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,960
balance pragmatism about the timelines

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,560
of technological development with

144
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,000
excitement over opportunities for

145
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,840
shorter-term impacts as Catherine Papa

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,240
George a fellow in the MIT system design

147
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,039
and management Masters program you can

148
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,120
be scared of the scale of the challenge

149
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,240
but finding solutions for the future is

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
really the opportunity of a lifetime

151
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,680
said Len V the global key account

152
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,440
manager medals at Shell energy when

153
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,319
people come to tell me all the reasons

154
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,759
something can't work I tell them I want

155
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,120
to hear how we make it work V also noted

156
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,800
that a lot of Technology moves fast and

157
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,319
what we thought we couldn't do 2 years

158
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,039
ago is happening today the next

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,280
generation of leaders in the energy

160
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,039
transition must cultivate a unique set

161
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,080
of skills including a significant amount

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,919
of patients because no solution is

163
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,720
perfect said Joanna Troy the director of

164
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,520
energy policy and planning at the

165
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Commonwealth of Massachusetts her job

166
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,560
which involves expanding clean energy

167
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,720
across the state and region requires

168
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,759
listening to stakeholders with competing

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,440
demands the road map is always changing

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,800
and you need to maintain a certain

171
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,400
internal calm focusing on making

172
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,599
decisions with the evidence you have in

173
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,520
front of you and then evaluating and

174
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,160
restarting the problem multiple times

175
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
she said course participants had ample

176
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,440
time to question practitioners such as

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,280
Troy and Robert aier the vice president

178
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,479
of system planning at ISO New England

179
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,360
not just on the specifics of their jobs

180
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,080
but for a glimpse of the future whether

181
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
widespread adoption of electric heat

182
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,560
pumps generation of green hydrogen or a

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,199
massive buildout of new transmission

184
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,879
lines what does history teach us

185
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,879
but instructors also caution

186
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,599
participants that technological fixes

187
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,280
for the future cannot in themselves

188
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,199
deliver Net Zero carbon results and even

189
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,520
good policy can get sidetracked emirus

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,400
served as director of the Central
