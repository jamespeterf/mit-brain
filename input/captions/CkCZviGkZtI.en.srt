need all the Champions we can find and

54
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,720
we need all the talent to not go to

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,360
waste and so because of some of the

104
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,440
self-identify as women or non-binary and

105
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,960
they're all majoring in computer science

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,039
and stem we found them they are here and

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,759
we want them to stay and that is what

108
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,039
our current cohort looks like and it

109
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,080

talent and as I mentioned we are at the

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
intersection of Academia and Industry we

113
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,479
would not be able to do this if it

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,039
weren't for our champions in the tech in

115
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,199

121
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,000
exciting to see the kind of proposed

122
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,880
machine learning projects that different

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,120
companies propose and how fascinated

124
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,759
they are with the fresh perspective that

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,560
our emerging talents can come up with

126
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,080

127
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,800
their critical thinking

128
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,840
skills and lastly one of the biggest

129
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,440
questions I get what what what's where

130
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,880

of our students secure a full Tech role

134
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,160
after successful completion of our AI

135
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,919
program I'm going to give you a little

136
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,319
snap shot of the core elements of what

137
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,160
makes this impactful in our program all

138
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,080
the students that are accepted and are

139
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,120
eligible in our program they start off

140
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,680
the program with a 9 weeks summer course

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,319
machine learning foundations because our

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,199
students are coming from various

143
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
backgrounds we want to make sure that

144
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,319
they have secured the fundamentals

145
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,919
knowledge to be prepared so then they

146
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,720
can apply what they have learned so they

147
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,280
start off with a summer course course

148
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,039
being taught by MIT faculty and graduate

149
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,800
Tas after successful completion they

150
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,000
will earn a

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,240
certificate and then from there they

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,280
will get to move into the next phase of

153
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,599
the program where we where we match them

154
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,280
with a real world project proposed by

155
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,759
company partners and as mentioned we

156
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,120
have a whole variety a whole diverse

157
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,800
pallet of machine learning projects from

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,800
various um tech companies that have

159
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
shown what are some of the ways how

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,919
they're applying AI in their day-to-day

161
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,199
work and our students are very excited

162
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,479
to apply what they have learned from the

163
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:18,639
machine learning foundations course into

164
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,199
this real world project Additionally the

165
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,120
power of community and mentorship is

166
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,599
critical to building the community to

167
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,919
strengthening self-efficacy for talents

168
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:35,560
and so we also extend their network with

169
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,039
Champions with mentors who have been

170
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,279
right where they were when they were in

171
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,959
their undergraduate or in a different

172
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,279
kind of career pathway they have they

173
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:48,440
get to form authentic meaningful

174
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:52,200
relationships with our mentors and so

175
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,440
they get to have close um close contact

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,720
and Communications to learn directly

177
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,120
from those of how to prepare for a

178
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,480
coding interview of how how to prepare

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,000
for a behavioral interview so having

180
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,040
that undivided attention and support

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,480
from somebody that have created a a safe

182
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,120
space for them to learn and grow and

183
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,880
that it is okay to ask all the questions

184
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,440
that you may have that is a PE uh

185
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,200
another key of our program component and

186
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,680
this is essentially a one-year program

187
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,040
that occurs where students are traveling

188
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,000

learned and put it into practice and

204
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,320
here are some key highlights that we

205
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,200
have heard from our partners in how they

206
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,920
have benefited from being a company

207
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,560
partner with us they were able to use

208
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,800
this partnership and demonstrate their

209
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,560
advancement towards their own diversity

210
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,200
and Tech objectives and as for the

211
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,760
employees it is a great way for the

212
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,320
employees to have an outlet to me mentor

213
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,800
and develop their managerial skills

214
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,680
their their soft skills to be able to

215
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,600
see the kind of uh impact that they have

216
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,079
on the Next Generation and essentially

217
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,200
it also helps with the greater good that

218
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,680
we are all shaping a future that

219
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,720
reflects the global world around us and

220
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,200
we cannot leave anyone

221
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,040
behind and so here are some of the ways

222
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,120
that we really wanted to encourage

223
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:05,200
people to join with us on how to engage

224
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,639

225
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,800
the people that are at your company who

226
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,000

227
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,720
that they do and want to pay it forward

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,880
we're looking for mentors we're Lo we're

229
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,720
also looking for subject matter experts

230
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,040
as well too because not only could they

231
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,279
be gifted and talented in their

232
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,000
technical expertise they can also share

233
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,920

who benefited from the program I share a

264
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,959
quote with you this is one of our

265
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,240
technical project advisors she proposed

266
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:10,760
a project on on an application to assist

267
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,560
blind people in describing the moments

268
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,160
and events and students were learning

269
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,480
sign language and many different ways to

270
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,800
think about all the different kind of

271
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,199
features that they can include in

272
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,720
developing this app and the project

273
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:28,079
advisor was

274
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,199
incredibly um impressed by the students

275
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,480
who are taking taking this as an

276
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,399
extracurricular bu uh skills building

277
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,600
program and being able to generate so

278
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,240
much um thoughts and and insights within

279
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,199
the time that they have together and so

280
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,760
I share this quote is because this is

281
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:50,279
not only a rewarding and fulfilling

282
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,759
experience for the talent but it's also

283
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:55,880
a way to really for those directly

284
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,759
involved in growing and cultivating the

285
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,399
talents they're also getting a

286
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,240
meaningful um impact throughout the

287
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,440
process as well and so I just wanted to

288
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,600
directly quote from this she said

289
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,320
serving as a challenge adviser was a

290
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,959
valuable experience for me and so this

291
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,880
is really a two-way street that it when

292
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,000
it helps it's not just only helping one

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,399
side of the group but it also helps both

294
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,759
sides of the

295
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:25,240
group and lastly I want to wrap up with

296
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,680
a closing quote of an alumni from our

297
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,639
very first cohort um I wanted to

298
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,880
highlight

299
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,360
her last statement in this quote being

300
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,560
the sense of accomplishment that

301
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,880
followed after completing the industry

302
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,560
project helped me find my footing as a

303
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,279
woman in Tech and these are the kind of

304
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,600
power compelling human elements that we

305
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,240
want to ensure that our program can

306
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,920
reach and continue to center

307
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,120
