laminated onto many different surfaces

solar traditional silicon solar cells

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,519
are fragile so they must be encased in

emerging class of thin film materials

72
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,519
that were so lightweight they could sit

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,680
on top of a soap bubble but these ultra

74
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,360
thin solar cells were fabricating using

75
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,920
complex vacuum based processes which can

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,640
be expensive and challenging to scale up

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,040
in this work they set out to develop

78
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,360
thin film solar cells that are entirely

79
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,959
printable using ink based materials and

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,720

cell structure using a slot dcoder which

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,720
deposits layers of the electronic

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,440
materials onto a prepared releasable

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,319
substrate that is only 3 microns thick

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,159
using screen printing a technique

90
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,360
similar to how designs are added to silk

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,879

93

the solar module the researchers can

94
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,439
then peel the printed module which is

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,599
about 15 microns in thickness off the

96
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,519
plastic substrate forming an ultra light

97
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,760
solar device but such thin freestanding

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,760
solar modules are challenging to handle

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,239
and can easily tear which would make

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,360
them difficult to deploy to solve this

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,519
challenge the MIT team search for a

102
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,159
lightweight flexible and high strength

103
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,920
substrate they could adhere the solar

104
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,920
cells too they identified Fabrics as the

105
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,079
optimal solution as they provide

106
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,400
mechanical resilience and flexibility

107
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,799
with little added weight they found an

108
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,200
ideal material a composite fabric that

109
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,919
weighs only 13 G per square met

110
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,160
commercially known as dyema this fabric

111
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,759
is made of fibers that are so strong

112
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,000
they were used as ropes to lift the

113
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,639
sunken cruise ship coasta Concordia from

114
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,199
the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea by

115
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,320
adding a layer of UV curable glue which

116
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,320
is only a few microns thick

117
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,080
they adhere the solar modules to sheets

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,919
of this fabric this forms an ultra light

119
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,520
and mechanically robust solar structure

120
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,320
while it might appear simpler to just

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,880
print the solar cells directly on the

122
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,880
fabric this would limit the selection of

123
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,800
possible Fabrics or other receiving

124
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,000
surfaces to the ones that are chemically

125
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,560
and thermally compatible with all the

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
processing steps needed to make the

127
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,919
devices our approach decouples the solar

128
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,360
cell manufacturing from its final

129
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,160
integration saravana pavanam explains

130
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,600
outshining conventional solar

131
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,680
cells when they tested the device the

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,560
MIT researchers found it could generate

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,479
730 watts of power per kgam when

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,280
freestanding and about 370 WS per kg if

135
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,000
deployed on the high strength dyema

136
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,720
fabric which is about 18 times more

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,600
power per kilogram than conventional

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,039
solar

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,080
cells a typical rooftop solar

140
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,000
installation in Massachusetts is about

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,240
8,000 watts to generate that same amount

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,600
of power our fabric photovoltaics would

143
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,360
only add about 20 kg 44 lb to the roof

144
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,400
of a house he says they also tested the

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,560
durability of their devices and found

146
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,440
that even after rolling and unrolling a

147
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,919
fabric solar panel more than 500 times

148
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,039
the cells still retain more than 90% of

149
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,199
their initial power generation

150
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,120
capabilities while their solar cells are

151
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
far lighter and much more flexible than

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
traditional cells they would need to be

153
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,680
encased in another material to protect

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,720
them from the environment the

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,600
carbon-based organic IC material used to

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
make the cells could be modified by

157
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,720
interacting with moisture and oxygen in

158
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,960
the air which could deteriorate their

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,000
performance encasing these solar cells

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,479
in heavy glass as is standard with the

161
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,160
traditional silicon solar cells would

162
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,400
minimize the value of the present

163
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,160
advancement so the team is currently

164
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,479
developing ultra thin packaging

165
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,880
solutions that would only fractionally

166
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,160
increase the weight of the present

167
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,759
ultral likee devices says maora we are

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,199
working to remove as much of the

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
non-solar active material as possible

170
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,080
while still retaining the form factor

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,319
and performance of these ultra light and

172
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,160
flexible solar structures for example we

173
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,639
know the manufacturing process can be

174
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,160
further streamlined by printing the

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,919
releasable substrates equivalent to the

176
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,039
process we use to fabricate the other

177
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,560
layers in our device this would

178
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,360
accelerate the translation of this

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,560
