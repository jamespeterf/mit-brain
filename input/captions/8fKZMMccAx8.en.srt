00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,680
every day we rely on a substance that's

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,120
harder than iron or steel our teeth

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,000
braces tether your teeth pulling them

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,599
together or pushing them apart and when

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,120
mechano receptors in the PDL sense this

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,640
kind of smaller but sustained Force they

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,480
signal cells called osteoclasts which

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,560
spew out acid and proteins to dissolve

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,800
parts of your jaw bone then the mech

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,800
receptors signal osteoblasts to come and

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,679
those cells deposit minerals that make

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,399
bone osteoblasts rebuild the jaw bone in

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,600
a new shape that lets the PDL hold teeth

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,480
in the new position but your body is

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,920
actually breaking down and rebuilding

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,680
bone using osteoclast and osteoblast all

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,480
the time not just if you have braces

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
it's easy to write braces off as a form

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,800
of medieval torture but it's kind of

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,960
amazing that this mouth torture actually

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,680
works and the technology that makes it

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,680
possible is not just in your braces it's

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,079
in your bones for more MIT moments from
