1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,640
Um, a a very very warm welcome, but I uh

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm going to turn it over to our um

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,720
hosts here at MIT to do the first

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,279
welcome.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
>> Cool. Um, can we move the slide one?

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,160
>> Oh, I got it. Okay, let's see.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,640
Um, do you want to talk about the flying

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,480
the plane?

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,559
>> Oh my gosh, I do. Um, all right. We're

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,480
going to get our This is actually the

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,040
perfect slide for our little start here,

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,280
which we coordinated and and rehearsed.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,600
Um, I I love this picture because it uh

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
basically embodies everything that is

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,120
the organization heat and and the

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,480
process of um moving forward in

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,000
uncertainty. So we are here today um

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
with this amazing course which you'll

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,160
about to hear more about uh building uh

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,280
and fixing the airplane while flying it.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,920
Um so I I I really want to know how that

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,799
picture came to be but

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,200
but it it stands. So it to that end I

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,640
want to acknowledge that you know we've

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,479
never done this before. Um it's really

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,799
can't it can't go wrong because of the

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,840
people in the room

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,280
and um we're really excited to see where

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,720
it does go. Uh and we're also really

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,119
excited to learn from it as always. So

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,200
for example, there is a lovely

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,840
whiteboard outside during your coffee

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,320
breaks that has two sides to it. One

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,720
side is who are the people and the ideas

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
and the topics that we need to add to

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,119
this conversation.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
Please please put your ideas there. Um

38
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,360
and the other one is just general

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,399
feedback. Um thoughts, ideas, learnings,

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,640
changes, etc. Um please don't hesitate

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,159
to give us the gift of feedback. Uh and

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
now for the part we probably should have

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,200
started with. Hi, I'm Zay McAfei. I'm

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,879
the executive director of HEAT. And heat

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,039
is a um is a a nonprofit that has been

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,440
focused on trying to solve climate

47
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,239
change for a lot of years uh from a

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,800
community level in the beginning and um

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,239
scaling. So

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,640
we um will talk more about the topic of

51
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,680
geothermal networks in a few minutes but

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,920
first I want to just um express a lot of

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,920
gratitude to all of you for being

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
present and here and offering yourselves

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,239
to this conversation and and journey

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
that might might look a little hazardous

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,319
at times. Um, and also I want to just um

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,280
thank MIT the inst the amazing

59
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,280
institution and both Chris and Kurt for

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,519
being our hosts and I want to turn it

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,000
over to them to introduce themselves.

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,480
>> Um, thanks Anab. Uh, so yeah, I'm so

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,920
excited uh to welcome heat here to MIT.

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,319
Uh, my name is Chris Rae. I'm the

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,879
education program director at uh MIT's

66
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,120
environmental solutions initiative. Um

67
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,280
the education program mission is to

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
better understand and expand climate

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,239
education across both uh disciplinary

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
contexts and institutional contexts. And

71
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,319
I'd really like to make sure that our

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,239
education our projects and activities

73
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,560
are connecting to real world uh

74
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
scenarios. So it's so exciting to be

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,159
working with heat and kind of

76
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,800
reinvisioning the way that energy can

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,120
work. Um this is a part of a few other

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,480
collaborations. So uh we started a new

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,640
course called environmental justice

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,720
science and technology and that has a

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,400
massive open online version and heat

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,239
participated with a really interesting

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,959
lecture. Um and then also we're working

84
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,360
on some K through2 curriculum in this uh

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,720
day of climate uh project through open

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,720
learning. So it's just really exciting

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,239
to be doing both the K through2 space

88
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
and the higher education space with

89
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,480
heat. So again just so excited for heat

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,480
to be here. Um thank you so much.

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
>> Good morning everyone. Um, my name is

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,519
Kurt Newton. I'm director of MIT Open

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,959
Courseware, another of the co-hosts for

94
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,200
this event. Um, and we're thrilled to be

95
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,120
participating in this, not just to host,

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,000
but also because this is all going to

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,159
flow out to the world. We're recording,

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,280
as you know, we've got video set up here

99
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,239
to um to capture and then share back

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,400
with the world this important emerging

101
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,639
knowledge. Um you know we've had the

102
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,800
pleasure at open courseware with serving

103
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
this broader mission of unlocking and

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,880
empowering people around the world both

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,240
learners and educators for over two

106
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,759
decades. Um you see a screenshot of you

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,520
know the first engagement that we had

108
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:41,040
with with heat with Zanb a uh a January

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,840
session workshop that we did uh about

110
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
gas leaks you know part of the maybe the

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,960
origin story for so what we're getting

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,639
up to here um and what we do at open

113
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,600
courseware is not just sharing this

114
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,759
knowledge again but to do so in ways

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,600
that um encourage practices of sharing

116
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,720
and the feedback that gets set up

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
through this through this sort of

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,040
broader open knowledge ecosystem. So

119
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,600
heat for instance, you know, putting all

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,720
of these resources in an open library

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,360
and gathering together to, you know, in

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,400
a really nimble sort of generative way

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,400
create this knowledge new. I I'm

124
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,440
recalling here at MIT in January 2020,

125
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,720
just before all kinds of stuff got shut

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,560
down, we we hosted here some design

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
cherettes to start this process. and

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,000
just what a what a thrill it is to us to

129
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
be kind of part of this journey

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
together. And just to let you know if

131
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,199
you're not familiar with open

132
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
courseware, you know, the the reach of

133
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,680
this content is considerable around the

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,560
world. 70% of our of our visitors come

135
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,840
from outside North America. So that the

136
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,520
interest around the world that's

137
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,919
developing in these technologies, we

138
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
want to plug into that. Our website gets

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,600
millions of visits every year. Um and

140
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,120
our YouTube channel where the videos you

141
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,440
know also live is also a really

142
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,960
important point of engagement. Um with

143
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
over five and a half million subscribers

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,880
on our YouTube channel it's the it's the

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,479
largest subscriber base of any sort of

146
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,680
educational institution out in the

147
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,400
world. So rest assured that that what we

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
come up with today you know flowing out

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,000
to the world is going to reach a lot of

150
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
people and it's really going to I think

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,440
further the the work that we're all

152
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:26,280
trying to get up to. So welcome.

153
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,280
But don't hesitate to talk after that.

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,520
>> Thank you. My name is Isabel Varela,

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,319
science director at HEAT. And I wanted

156
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,080
to briefly share this is the heat team

157
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,720
that is here to help you. If you have

158
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,520
any questions, uh don't hesitate to

159
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,160
reach out to us.

160
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,240
We've put together um an incredible

161
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,880
program. HEAT takes the aim to look at

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
uh for solving a problem bring identify

163
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
all the stakeholders that need to be

164
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,600
involved to make that change happen and

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,319
this two-day course reflects that. As

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,720
you see we have eight sessions for each

167
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,880
day and they vary from what is the

168
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,240
challenge that we need to solve? What

169
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,120
are the policies that need to be

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,520
implemented to do that? Um what are the

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
learnings that we can get from the

172
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
geothermal networks that are implemented

173
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,440
today? what are the design principles

174
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,680
that should be applied um and learn from

175
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
case studies.

176
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,960
We are excited that you're here and we

177
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,360
hope you get uh most out of this course

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,720
and participate your participation makes

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,720
the course more lively

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
and

181
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,280
we have an incredible lineup of 28

182
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,840
speakers that are here. Some of them

183
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,120
have come from uh around the country to

184
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,720
be here in these two days. And we have

185
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,880
organizations represented from

186
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,440
universities, gas utilities, regulators,

187
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,840
design firms, and community- based

188
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,080
organizations. So, thank you for all the

189
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,280
speakers uh that are here and making

190
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,280
this uh course happen.

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,520
Um

192
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,639
>> just a quick note about the nature of

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,319
the recordings that we're going to be

194
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,599
doing. So what we'll be sharing with the

195
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,639
world will be the the talks

196
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,639
um and just the videos of the talks.

197
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,360
There's a really important sort of Q&A

198
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,160
interaction segment that will happen for

199
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,560
each each of the sessions and we will

200
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,479
not be sharing those straight out with

201
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,919
the world. We want to have a you know a

202
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,680
frank um completely un you know

203
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,080
unconstrained conversation here in the

204
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,479
room. Our hope is though that we will be

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,560
sharing some kind of notes and takeaways

206
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,040
some summaries and synthesis from those

207
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,600
conversations. But rest assured um

208
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,000
unless you are a speaker up here. We're

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
not expecting you to show up in these

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,160
videos that we share on OCW. If you have

211
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,560
any concerns or questions about that uh

212
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,680
please reach out to me, be in touch, but

213
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,600
hopefully that's all right. Okay.

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,600
>> Uh yeah. And um our our format uh is

215
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,399
that each session is going to have a few

216
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,200
brief presentations. Every single one of

217
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:18,399
the speakers could likely speak for

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,640
hours uh on any one of the topics and um

219
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,640
and we're so aware of that. But we also

220
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,560
thought that the most valuable thing

221
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,720
here in the room is the interaction

222
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,920
between. Uh so for um many speakers

223
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,839
there will be a longer recorded piece of

224
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,440
content that's attached to the

225
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,680
courseware. Um but in the room we're

226
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
going to keep the presentations brief so

227
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,680
that we can get to that part of

228
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,160
interacting between and talking and

229
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,680
interacting with all of you. Um, and uh,

230
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,240
we've got a Slido. Um, it's a little app

231
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,720
that we'll introduce in a second um, for

232
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,279
you to engage so we can kind of get more

233
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,240
voices involved more quickly um, so that

234
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,920
we can get the conversation going. Um,

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
and then I've said this already, I'm

236
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,880
going to say it again. You know, this is

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,360
this is our first go at this. Um, I I

238
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,959
love that you mentioned the previous um,

239
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,760
wonderful events. The first one was a

240
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,320
hackathon to design a a a tool to

241
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,920
measure gas leaks. Um and the second one

242
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,640
was a sharet. And now we're now we're

243
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,320
trying um this this content. So uh

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
you you will you will be part of making

245
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,160
it um wonderful today. So please don't

246
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,640
hesitate to participate. All right.

247
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,880
One last comment for housekeeping. We

248
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,880
have uh breakfast in the morning

249
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,519
outside. We'll have coffee breaks. We'll

250
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,519
have lunch outside. Uh food is allowed

251
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
to come in here if you want to.

252
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
Restrooms are here immediately to the

253
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,920
right and there's another one in the

254
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,720
hallway uh to the left.

255
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,519
>> Thank you. And Isabelle planned this

256
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,640
incredibly. So

257
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,240
>> with the tea. With the tea.

258
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,320
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With with the tea.

259
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,880
All right. So one of the things that we

260
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,079
always do and and I know Kurt is always

261
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,320
in on this. It's open. So, uh, your

262
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,160
backgrounds here in the room are all

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
over the spectrum. We think that's

264
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,360
beautiful and exciting. And one of the

265
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,959
things we're going to try to do is make

266
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,600
sure that we move between um,

267
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,600
introductory and advanced. And we're

268
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,279
we're it may be a fire hose, but that's

269
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,360
why we're providing coffee. Um, so I get

270
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,279
to start us off with two quick ideas for

271
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,760
the entire two days and then we have the

272
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,880
most amazing panel to get going at a

273
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,279
very like high scale level of you know

274
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,519
the whole the whole world. Um, so

275
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
um

276
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,839
our our new our new uh tagline at the

277
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,440
moment at HEAT is think thermal

278
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,279
together.

279
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
Um it kind of embodies a lot of the

280
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,880
pieces that we're we've been learning

281
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,000
over the past few years as we move

282
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,040
forward with um networking ground source

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,160
heat pumps or geothermal heat pumps. And

284
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,240
um that idea of getting uh a problem

285
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,079
solved by working together that's that's

286
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,720
always been um there. But the piece

287
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,200
where we realized as we as we spoke

288
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,839
about geothermal that thermal energy

289
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,000
itself wasn't always on the table in the

290
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
climate solution space that people

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,959
weren't thinking, they weren't

292
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,959
measuring, they weren't talking about

293
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,040
thermal energy. So, I'm going to just

294
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,360
briefly start by getting us to take a

295
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,480
moment to put on our thermal energy

296
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,040
glasses. Um and then I'm going to do a

297
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,240
little bit of housekeeping on language

298
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,079
so that uh you know terminology and then

299
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,079
we'll move to our first panel. Um so

300
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,519
think thermal. Let's start with that

301
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,959
part. Uh this is an image. If you use a

302
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,040
thermal camera which actually we've

303
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,399
recently purchased for the sheer fun of

304
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,720
it. Um if you use a thermal camera you

305
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,040
see things differently. um our eyes

306
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,560
don't do that which may be why we don't

307
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,880
we ignore it so often. Um but there is a

308
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,800
huge amount of thermal energy in our

309
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,120
earth and really if you stop and think

310
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,839
about climate change what is climate

311
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,480
change except a thermal energy

312
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,440
regulation problem.

313
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,519
And so if that's what it is and we talk

314
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,440
about the rising temperature in air,

315
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,200
well the kind of stunning thing is that

316
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,839
uh there are a bunch of papers

317
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,079
calculating how much thermal energy the

318
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:38,160
earth has absorbed since say 1960

319
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,839
um and it's 630

320
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,800
times

321
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,800
approximately all of the energy humanity

322
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,920
uses every year.

323
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,519
So I I was delighted to learn a new

324
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,240
metric of energy, the zeta jewel. Um

325
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,079
apparently humanity uses half a zeta

326
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,560
jewel a year. All the energy we use. And

327
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:05,199
every year our oceans alone are

328
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,120
absorbing five zeta jewels.

329
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,399
So that's a kind of stunning

330
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,399
gut-wrenching challenge.

331
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,839
But if you start to think about thermal

332
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,440
energy, if start to look at it, if you

333
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,160
start to measure it, it's also an

334
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,480
extraordinary opportunity. It's a

335
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,760
massive amount of energy all around us

336
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,079
that we have been ignoring.

337
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,360
And we have the technology to tap it,

338
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
which is what we're here to talk about

339
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,639
today.

340
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,279
Um, a recent report from the IEA had a

341
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,600
rather stunning statement um that kind

342
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,680
of defines part of our our two days that

343
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
the technical potential of geothermal

344
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,399
would be more than enough to meet all

345
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,920
heat demand. That's all heat demand. And

346
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
they're not even talking about cooling

347
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
in Africa, China, Europe, Southeast

348
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,079
Asia, and the United States. So, I read

349
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,920
that and I thought, well, what about

350
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,920
those other places? Um

351
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,920
but I also want to just add into the

352
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,279
conversation not just that geothermal

353
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,399
energy that's in the world all around us

354
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,279
um but also

355
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,279
uh the energy we waste all that energy

356
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,480
we do use combust burn etc um the

357
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,040
majority of it is wasted

358
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,199
uh and a large large portion of that is

359
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,920
thermal energy. So that is where we can

360
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,680
think about yet another untapped

361
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,320
resource all around us. All right. So

362
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,600
taking the optimistic part of like wow

363
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,519
there's thermal energy all around us.

364
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
This is really exciting. Um what we're

365
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,360
here to do today for two days is talk

366
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,920
about um the technology we uh believe is

367
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,519
there and ready for us to tap it and

368
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,440
turn it into a solution. Um talking

369
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
about that technology sometimes has some

370
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
challenges.

371
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,720
Um

372
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
we we try to bring everyone together.

373
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
Lots of different groups have lots of

374
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,560
different language. Um this is kind of

375
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,360
the heat approach that we've been

376
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,320
talking about uh earlier with many other

377
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,720
events. Um you're now part of it being

378
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
in the room. Uh so coming together

379
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,199
around what we mean when we say things

380
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,800
is one way to start get us all on the

381
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,800
same page. Um, and

382
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,680
the first thing we have is a little

383
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
quick intro visual, which many of you

384
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,720
may have already seen. I apologize if

385
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,759
you have. Um, explaining the technology

386
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,680
of networking geothermal heat pumps in a

387
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
very basic level. Tomorrow, you're going

388
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,680
to get a very advanced level. For now,

389
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,920
this is right beneath our feet. The

390
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,440
Earth is soaking up energy from the sun.

391
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,160
And it's been doing this for a long

392
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,480
time. Near the surface, the ground warms

393
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,079
and cools with the seasons, but lower

394
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
down, it stays at a constant

395
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,320
temperature. In Massachusetts, that's

396
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,880
55° F year round. This store temperature

397
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,040
is a source of renewable energy. It can

398
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,600
be access to heat or cool a single

399
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,000
building without using fossil fuels. But

400
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,000
did you know we can also connect entire

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,439
communities to that renewable source in

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,679
the ground? How does it work? It starts

403
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,839
with underground pipes in the streets,

404
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,559
sort of like gas pipes, but filled only

405
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,400
with water. The water absorbs the ground

406
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,799
temperature of the earth and delivers it

407
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,120
to buildings. Pipes connect buildings

408
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,760
with different heating needs. So, energy

409
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,360
is never wasted. Instead, it's exchanged

410
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,760
between buildings or stored in the

411
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,480
ground until it's needed. Inside, a heat

412
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,280
pump moves heat in or out according to

413
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,000
the temperature you want. This system of

414
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,280
pipes can connect like Lego blocks.

415
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,520
gradually moving us all from gas to geo,

416
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,919
giving us cleaner air, efficient heating

417
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,559
and cooling, and a healthier planet. The

418
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,440
idea for this worked geothermal system

419
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,799
run at a utility scale originated at

420
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,640
HEAT, a climate solutions nonprofit.

421
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,000
Uh, all right, I'm going to really

422
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
quickly go through language and then get

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
out of here for so we can start this

424
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,120
amazing panel. Um the word geothermal uh

425
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,039
if any of you are thinking about uh you

426
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,720
know Iceland and hot lava that's that's

427
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:11,679
the stuff on the left. Um this is our

428
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,840
one way to try to clarify that

429
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,720
geothermal is like the last name of a

430
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,919
family of technologies and energies

431
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,960
both. Um and that uh the one we are

432
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,480
talking about today is on the right. It

433
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,559
isworked

434
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,600
geothermal heat pumps can provide

435
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,000
heating and cooling is what is typically

436
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,840
called shallow. You'll hear purple hear

437
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,039
people use the word shallow. Um but for

438
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,360
the usual person uh 1,000 or 1200 feet

439
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,400
isn't doesn't sound shallow but I I

440
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,559
promise that's shallow. Um and then uh

441
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
it is ambient temperature. In other

442
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,160
words kind of the average temperature of

443
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,120
the air and the ground. not super hot in

444
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,200
any way. Um, and uh, one of the things

445
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,840
that's really critical about this type

446
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,640
of geothermal energy is that it is

447
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,600
everywhere.

448
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,559
Um, you'll hear people talking about the

449
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,200
word district and certainly this is a

450
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,000
form of district energy and the

451
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,840
traditional naming system goes by

452
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,799
generation. first generation, second

453
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,520
generation and the type we are

454
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:26,000
discussing today primarily is fifth

455
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:29,600
generation. Um and

456
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,520
the next more advanced level of this is

457
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,160
okay. So why are we calling it a network

458
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,480
then? And uh our proposal which is not

459
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,400
universal um but there is kind of an

460
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,400
emerging nomenclature um is that within

461
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,400
fifth generation um if it has a single

462
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,679
pipe decentralized and renewable and

463
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,640
combustion free then it is a thermal

464
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,720
energy network and if that thermal

465
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,880
energy network is tapping geothermal

466
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,039
energy which changes some of the

467
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,919
outcomes then you could also call it a

468
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,360
geothermal energy work. That's what

469
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
we're going to use, but you'll hear

470
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,760
speakers use a lot of different

471
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,919
terminology. I just wanted to give you a

472
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,120
a quick lay of the land. Um, and our

473
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,039
last task before we begin is if you

474
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,200
could please take out your phone. We

475
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,440
have um this QR code you can scan and it

476
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,039
should work pretty easily to get you on

477
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,280
to Slido. And now you have um your first

478
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,200
quiz.

479
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,799
We did say class, right?

480
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,799
No, don't don't worry. There's actually

481
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:44,240
no test. Uh but um

482
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:48,440
let's see how you do.

483
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,440
Yeah, I made it too easy.

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,320
So, if you have any trouble getting on,

485
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,720
um, Erica back there is happy to help.

486
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,679
>> You can also, you can also open your web

487
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,679
browser and just go to slid.com and type

488
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,679
in.

489
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,840
>> All right.

490
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,559
I like watching them go out and back.

491
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,559
That's how I think.

492
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,840
All right. Are we good?

493
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,480
everyone on slidoh now for the rest of

494
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:59,280
the day. Okay. Uh so yes um the the

495
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:02,480
group um the group wisdom is prevailing.

496
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,720
Uh the type of geothermal energy we're

497
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,600
discussing today is ambient shallow and

498
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,840
everywhere. Um which is a lovely

499
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,320
feature.

500
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,200
Um all right. So, we're going to take a

501
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:22,200
a second and um begin our first uh

502
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
conversation.
