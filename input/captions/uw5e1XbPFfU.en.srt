1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,530

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,760
Well, Thanks to Governor Healey.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,160
I so appreciated her remarks.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,630
So let me start my own remarks
with a few essential thank yous.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,050
First, I have to say, in
reading through today's program,

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,900
I expect that we all
had the same experience.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,840
Holy Toledo, this
lineup is spectacular.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,200
The caliber of the speakers,
the boldness of their thinking,

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,390
the scale of their
accomplishments,

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,320
the range of frontier
subjects being covered

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,340
is just astounding, sort of
like a fantasy football team

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,160
if biologists played football.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,420
In any case, I want to start
by thanking the incredible team

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,670
that persuaded all of
these brilliant people

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,810
to bend their calendars
to make this day possible.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,600
Special shoutout to our Dean
of Science, Nergis Mavalvala,

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,850
to Dean of Engineering
and Chief Innovation

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,790
and Strategy Officer,
Anantha Chandrakasan,

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,390
to the entire Faculty Program
Planning Committee co-chaired

20
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,459
by Professors Amy Keating
and Katharina Ribbeck,

21
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,250
and especially to Marsha
Warren and the events team,

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,540
who orchestrated every detail.

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,450
We're all in your debt for
creating this extraordinary day.

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,180
And of course, I want to thank
all of our speakers from inside

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,830
and outside of MIT for
offering this amazing 14-course

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,430
intellectual banquet.

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,550
The talent assembled here--

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,620
from those who will
speak, to every one of

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,350
you-- has produced some truly
towering accomplishments.

30
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,990
But also, and I believe
more importantly,

31
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,430
you represent a deep well
of creative potential

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,320
for even greater impact, which
brings me to the insights that

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,400
inspired MIT HEALS.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,790
Since I still have
fairly fresh eyes

35
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,950
on the wonders of this
multi-institutional community,

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,050
let me start with a
little perspective.

37
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,880
So I started my career as a
cell biologist and then a cancer

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
biologist.

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,720
And my husband, Danny Lew,
also leads a research group

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,330
here focused on pure
curiosity-driven science.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,810
Well, we both had
long, happy careers

42
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,890
at another fine university.

43
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,919
But I will never
forget the expression

44
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,310
on Danny's face the day I
mentioned that I might interview

45
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,740
for the president's job at MIT.

46
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,460
MIT?

47
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,390
It was like those cartoon
dogs, where the eyes spin.

48
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,090
He was thrilled-- we
both were-- to think

49
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,460
we might join a place
with such a wall

50
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,880
to wall appreciation
for fundamental science.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,080
And you can imagine
when we got here--

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,870
like kids in a candy store.

53
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,210
But pretty quickly, you
realize it's not a candy store.

54
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,830
It's a candy factory--

55
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,040
not only MIT, but the whole bio
ecosystem, from Kendall Square

56
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,190
to the seaport, to the
legendary hospitals

57
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,890
and the countless corporations,
startups, universities,

58
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,540
venture capitalists,
incubators, and philanthropists

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,660
across the region.

60
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,030
You see it any time you meet a
clinician or a faculty member.

61
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,330
Even students, they're exploring
techniques or technologies

62
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,728
right at the frontier
of their fields.

63
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,770
And then they casually
tell you, oh, yeah, I also

64
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,290
started a company
or two or more.

65
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,430
As a source of new knowledge
and new tools and new cures,

66
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,250
and of the innovators
and innovations that

67
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,970
will shape the future of
biomedicine and health,

68
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,490
there is just no place like it.

69
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,820
And today, we're here
to talk about how

70
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,660
we can make it even better.

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,050
That is the ambition
behind MIT HEALS.

72
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,870
Our goal with MIT HEALS is to
inspire, accelerate, and deliver

73
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,620
solutions at scale to
some of society's most

74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,930
urgent and intractable
health challenges.

75
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,400
So with that goal in mind
and with expert guidance

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,480
and leadership from
many of you here today,

77
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,350
including Anantha and Nergis
and many other faculty leaders,

78
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,950
we've identified
three priority areas

79
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,440
where we have a
vital opportunity

80
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,300
to make a real difference.

81
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,880
In shorthand, these
three priorities

82
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,400
are talent, collaborations,
and bridges.

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,380
First, talent-- the caliber
of talent in this room today

84
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,580
is the caliber of talent that
this ecosystem needs every day

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,460
forever.

86
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,230
If we want to be the biotech
capital of the world,

87
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,330
to spawn the next
biotech revolution too,

88
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,560
we can't take this concentration
of talent for granted.

89
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,700
But nothing attracts
talent like talent.

90
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,060
So a crucial part of MIT
HEALS will be finding ways

91
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,140
to support, mentor, connect,
and foster community

92
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,430
for the very best minds at
every stage of their careers.

93
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,790
The second priority
of MIT HEALS is

94
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,160
to spark new cross-cutting
collaborations

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,120
between individuals, both
within MIT and with allies

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,310
in the hospitals and industry.

97
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,690
To encourage faculty to pursue
high-risk, high-impact ideas,

98
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,720
were going to be providing
substantial MIT funding.

99
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,080
So why is this?

100
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,760
Now, certainly because
daring, unproven ideas

101
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,460
can often be the
most transformative,

102
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,400
but also because federal
dollars are only shrinking.

103
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,510
Federal funding seems to
get more and more cautious

104
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,750
all the time.

105
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,730
I mean, I remember
this frustration--

106
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,090
and I'm sure many of you
experienced this frustration

107
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,290
firsthand-- to get a grant.

108
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,550
Sometimes people prefer you've
actually finished or almost

109
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,930
finished the work that
you're proposing to do.

110
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,560
This doesn't lead to
transformative discoveries

111
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,710
necessarily.

112
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,150
I also want to emphasize that
this internal funding will

113
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,550
support not only translation,
but deep, fundamental,

114
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,340
curiosity-driven research.

115
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,700
For people outside
academia, it's

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,170
very easy to see the
value of translation.

117
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,600
They see the cures that
make it to the bedside.

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,540
Yet for some outside of
the scientific community,

119
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,270
it can be a mystery why we care
so much about basic research.

120
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,670
But it is fundamental
curiosity that

121
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,820
has driven the discovery
of so much of what we know

122
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,210
and now take for granted
in the life sciences.

123
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,030
And I have to say--

124
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,790
I always say this-- even for
those focused on translation,

125
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,700
you can't translate nothing.

126
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,820
You have to think about the
fact that today's cutting-edge

127
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,820
approaches-- immunotherapy,
AIDS therapy, the mRNA vaccines,

128
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,240
the new sickle cell cure,
thanks to things like CRISPR,

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,840
things discoveries made based
on just fundamental curiosity--

130
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,410
all of them sprang
from a robust pipeline

131
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,950
of breakthrough knowledge.

132
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,640
So we're investing
enthusiastically

133
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,070
to keep that pipeline strong.

134
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,630
And of course, in
terms of translation,

135
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,800
we're eager to empower
MIT's unique community

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,100
at the juncture of
engineering and bioscience

137
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,250
in an era powered by
incredible new tools.

138
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,010
We want to give these faculty
members the confidence

139
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,080
to collaborate freely
with colleagues

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,590
from across disciplines-- from
AI, policy, and economics,

141
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,680
to the humanities, to design.

142
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,330
We want them to take
on the hardest problems

143
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,810
and pursue their biggest ideas.

144
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,790
We see great potential
for producing

145
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,660
practical, scalable solutions
in a wide variety of fields

146
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,020
such as AI and life science,
low-cost diagnostics,

147
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,370
neuroscience and mental health,
environmental life science, food

148
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,290
and agriculture, the future of
public health and health care,

149
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,920
and women's health.

150
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,600
Third and finally, MIT HEALS
will prioritize building bridges

151
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,980
between institutions, developing
even stronger, more effective

152
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,280
relationships with the
region's world-class hospitals

153
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,960
and biotech and
pharma industries.

154
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,590
Several of our
faculty, many faculty,

155
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,260
have established very
fruitful research programs

156
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,350
with hospitals
across the Charles.

157
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,400
I think about the work of
Regina Barzilay and J-Clinic

158
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,990
as standout examples.

159
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,840
But we want to
make it much easier

160
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,780
to make these relationships
spring up and flourish.

161
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,850
We want them to be
in reach for everyone

162
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,710
so that each PI doesn't
have to reinvent the process

163
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,430
and re-navigate the same
barriers around data sharing,

164
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,950
computing power, and more.

165
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,460
And at the same time,
while MIT has always

166
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,770
had a distinctive openness
to working with industry,

167
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,800
we believe that
there is much more

168
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,630
we can do to connect
our researchers

169
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,010
with the full power
of the ecosystem,

170
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,300
from biotech to pharma.

171
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,940
I have to say, I can speak
from my own experience--

172
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,370
even though it's receding
into the distant past--

173
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,650
working on basic science of a
particular drug-resistant breast

174
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,460
cancer.

175
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,429
We published a paper in
Science Translational Medicine.

176
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,299
We even patented our findings.

177
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,780
But it felt absolutely
impossible to take it further.

178
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,620
We didn't have an
ecosystem to plug into.

179
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,540
Here we definitely
have the ecosystem.

180
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,300
And MIT HEALS will help to very
deliberately improve and deepen

181
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,100
those connections, too.

182
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,730
Overall, MIT HEALS
is an opportunity

183
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,840
to make our work as individuals
and institutions collectively

184
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,820
add up to more than
the sum of our parts.

185
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,030
And I believe this
effort could not be

186
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,520
more timely or more important.

187
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,220
A key next step will be
selecting a faculty member

188
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,480
to serve as a director.

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,130
And a team of faculty
from across the institute

190
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,440
are conducting the
search right now.

191
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,720
In each of the
areas I described--

192
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,930
talent, collaboration
between individuals,

193
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,580
and bridges between
institutions,

194
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,600
we feel that action
is imperative.

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,030
And it gives me
great pleasure to let

196
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,610
you know that MIT
HEALS has already

197
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,850
attracted major support from
several sources, for instance,

198
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,550
in the area of talent.

199
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,430
An important aspect
of MIT HEALS is

200
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,580
supporting our graduate students
to explore new directions

201
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,690
in life science, particularly
interdisciplinary research.

202
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,060
I'm pleased that MIT
will be able to provide

203
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,790
new internal support
for an initial cohort

204
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,470
of graduate fellows
for MIT HEALS.

205
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,110
And we're delighted
that the founder

206
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,780
and CEO of Flagship Pioneering,
Noubar Afeyan, who's

207
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,540
here today--

208
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,850
one of our long-time
collaborators,

209
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,240
a member of the Executive
Committee of the MIT

210
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,200
Corporation, and a former MIT
Course X PhD student himself--

211
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,100
has committed to supporting
additional graduate fellowships

212
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,255
as part of MIT HEALS
So thank you, Noubar.

213
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,971
[APPLAUSE]

214
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:31,340

215
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,610
In the same spirit of
supporting great talent and as

216
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,800
another key part
of MIT HEALS, we

217
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,040
will launch the MIT Health and
Life Sciences Collaborative

218
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,320
Fellows Program, a
world-class program

219
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
for postdoctoral scholars.

220
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,300
This highly competitive program
will give fellows the freedom

221
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,760
to explore some of the
most pressing issues

222
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,750
in life science
and human health.

223
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,730
Fellows will receive a four-year
fully funded appointment at MIT

224
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,220
and benefit from faculty
mentorship, as well

225
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,860
as participation in
community events focused

226
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,920
on careers in academia,
industry, and entrepreneurship.

227
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,060
We are delighted to announce
a gift from the Biswas Family

228
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,300
Foundation to establish
the inaugural cohort

229
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,930
of postdoctoral fellows.

230
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,920
The Biswas Fellows will
conduct cross-cutting research

231
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,750
in areas such as AI
computation and health,

232
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,400
low-cost diagnostics, nanoscale
therapeutics, neuroscience,

233
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,030
women's health, and
curiosity-driven life sciences.

234
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,200
Thank you so much to the
Biswas Family Foundation.

235
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,883
[APPLAUSE]

236
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:36,980

237
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,510
As an example of sparking
new collaborations,

238
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm also thrilled to announce
another integral piece of MIT

239
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,880
HEALS--

240
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,970
the new Hood Pediatric
Innovation Hub.

241
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,420
It was established
through a catalytic gift

242
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,530
from the Charles
H. Hood Foundation,

243
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,610
a leader in supporting
groundbreaking and innovative

244
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,050
pediatric research.

245
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,550
Led by Professor
Elazer Edelman--

246
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,450
the Edward J. Poitras Professor
in Medical Engineering

247
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,110
and Science and a world-renowned
cardiologist-- the hub

248
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,240
will bridge the
translational gap

249
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,570
for innovations in pediatrics.

250
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,580
Currently, the major
market incentives

251
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,730
are medical innovations
intended for adults.

252
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,070
As one example,
children are often

253
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,440
treated with medical
devices and therapies that

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,260
don't meet their needs because
they're simply scaled down

255
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,460
versions of the adult models.

256
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,380
The Hood Pediatric Innovation
Hub aims to overcome such

257
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,650
persistent barriers to bringing
life-saving technologies

258
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,470
to market by leveraging MIT's
state-of-the-art technological

259
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,940
expertise and a network of
health care stakeholders across

260
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,910
the country.

261
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,510
It will also strengthen
collaborations

262
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,600
with many hospitals, including
with an important partner

263
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,380
in Boston Children's Hospital.

264
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,083
So huge thanks to
the Hood Foundation.

265
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,265
[APPLAUSE]

266
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:59,720

267
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,120
And finally, I'm
excited to share

268
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,060
that one of the flagship
components of MIT HEALS

269
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,540
will be a collaboration
framework between MIT and Mass

270
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,800
General Brigham.

271
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,920
It will bring together these
two world-class research

272
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,430
institutions to advance
technology and clinical research

273
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,030
for transformative
changes in patient care.

274
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,920
Through the MIT-MGB
Seed Program,

275
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,560
we are garnering
and will continue

276
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,140
to seek philanthropic
funding to establish

277
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,730
seed grants for joint research
projects led by MIT and MGB

278
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,900
researchers in mutual
areas of interest.

279
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,860
And I'm extremely
pleased to announce

280
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,570
that Analog Devices will
help launch the MIT-MGB Seed

281
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,740
program with gifts
to both MIT and MGB

282
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,400
to establish the Analog Devices,
Inc. Fund for Health and Life

283
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,380
Sciences.

284
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,130
This visionary gift, which has
been described by Analog CEO

285
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,930
Vince Roche as a
once-in-a-generation

286
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,290
opportunity, will help
accelerate the adoption

287
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,060
of critical sensing, digital,
and AI technologies in clinical

288
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,940
settings.

289
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,540
And the new framework
overall will

290
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,600
be a model for how we can
all work together more

291
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,140
effectively in the future.

292
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,003
So thank you to MGB, and
thank you to analog devices.

293
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,654
[APPLAUSE]

294
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:25,990

295
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,245
So this is fantastic.

296
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:31,920
I mean, you can see there's
fuel, energy, power behind this.

297
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,570
We have very high
hopes for MIT HEALS.

298
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,200
And the momentum is
already beginning

299
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,300
to make these aspirations real.

300
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,690
Now, before I close, I have
to particularly call out

301
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,670
the Dean of Engineering
and Chief Innovation

302
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,760

303
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,400
has had the vision and
drive behind bringing

304
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,475
this initiative to life.

305
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,350
So I really want to
thank you again, Anantha.

306
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,234
[APPLAUSE]

307
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:59,950

308
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,900
And to all of you, I'm
so grateful that you've

309
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,070
joined us for this
important moment,

310
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,920
for this outstanding program.

311
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,810
Look forward to
working with all of you

312
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,800
as we work to seek new
knowledge, bold new solutions

313
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,610
to real problems in human
health in fields from cancer

314
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,790
to climate change.

315
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,180
So thank you all, and I hope
everyone enjoys the day.

316
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,630
[APPLAUSE]

317
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,000
