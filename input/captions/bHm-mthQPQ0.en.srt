1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,160
And so without further

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:16,480
ado, our um first uh finalist, Martin

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,480
Stoodka, who's a master's student

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,800
from our tech and policy

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,800
program. Take it away, Martin.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,599
And the clicker

7
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,599
Is this it?

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah. Tonight, I'd like to try to

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,120
convince you all of three

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,440
things. I'm going to talk about a system

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
I call fossil tokens and hopefully I

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,519
will convince you that it is effective

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,799
at mitigating climate change. Hopefully

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
I will convince you that it is

15
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
technically feasible and finally that it

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,760
is within reach of what we can do from

17
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,080
where we are

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,920
today. Let's get

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,119
started. 75% of climate change is caused

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,280
by fossil fuels. What this means is we

21
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
must restructure our energy systems away

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,360
from fossil fuels.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,759
The good news is we have the

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
technologies to do this at least most of

25
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,320
the way. We have electric vehicles,

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,600
renewable energy, energy storage, etc.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
The challenge is a lot of these

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,799
technologies are expensive and we lack

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,640
the incentives to roll these out at

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
scale. Governments have tried different

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,799
things, tax credits, carbon tax,

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,159
restricting fossil fuel extraction. But

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,520
each of these have their own drawbacks

34
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,799
and challenges. So here's an idea. What

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,720
if everybody knew the amount of fossil

36
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,439
fuels used in making every products they

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,360
might purchase? What if you could go to

38
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,040
the to the grocery store and come back

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
home and open up an app and it would

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,439
tell you exactly for each item you

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
purchased how much fossil fuels were

42
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,560
used to produce it? In this case, the

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,120
apples used 2 g kilograms of CO2 to make

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,760
that product. What if this app was

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,760
actually your banking app and you could

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,239
see it for all of your purchases over

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,800
the last

48
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,319
month? Now, if you think Martin,

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,239
nobody's going to care, I don't blame

50
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,160
you. In fact, we've seen similar efforts

51
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,920
with all these labels and the entire

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
point of these labels in theory is to

53
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,080
empower consumers to make better

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,480
purchasing decisions. But the truth is,

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,239
eco labels are marketing tools and they

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
overwhelm us and we don't really trust

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,640
them often. And for good reason. A lot

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,040
of these eco labels are created by

59
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,519
industry groups and have lower

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,519
performance

61
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,879
standards. The truth is consumers want

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,959
to be able to fight climate change. One

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,680
in two Americans say they're willing to

64
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,000
contribute up to 1% of their income to

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
fight climate change. And if this

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
statistic seems surprising, well,

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,400
consider that the same paper in nature

68
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
climate change found that the vast

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
majority of respondents underestimated

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,560
the actual proportion of people willing

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,800
to fight for climate change in their

72
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,400
country. So let's think again. If data

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,120
on fossil fuel usage is widely

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,239
available, then perhaps apps like these

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,239
could be helpful. Perhaps the apps would

76
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
help consumers feel good when they have

77
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
less emissions. And perhaps the apps

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,200
could help them figure out which of

79
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,560
their purchases are actually the most

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,840
polluting. This is what I call decision

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,239
tools. Now, there's another nice thing

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
with having this data available and

83
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,400
that's that we could have labels like

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
these in grocery stores. Now, these

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
aren't like eco labels. They are not

86
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,120
created by the producers of that

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,560
product. They are created by the grocery

88
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
store that compares all the different

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
apples. And truth be told, when I go

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,120
shopping for apples, I don't really care

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,920
which ones I get. I just like, yeah,

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,760
they're all the same to me. So, I think

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,239
that these types of labels in some cases

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,159
would make a big difference. So, we

95
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,159
could say we will also get some trust

96
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,160
trusted

97
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,320
advertising. So, why does any of this

98
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,720
matter? Well, now that we have this, we

99
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,720
can organize consumer buying power. We

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
can get consumers to be shifting their

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
purchases towards products that are more

102
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,160
sustainable. This in turn creates

103
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,240
competition among industry to lower

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,400
emissions. And now we have a way for

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
consumers to incentivize companies to

106
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,040
reduce their emissions. And suddenly

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,639
companies will be starting to use better

108
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
technologies and we will be able to

109
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,919
restructure our energy systems away from

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,240
fossil fuels. So hopefully I've made a

111
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,880
decent case of why such a system might

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,479
be effective. So now let's look at how

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,479
this might actually work.

114
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,320
This is what I call a fossil

115
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,280
token. But unlike a currency, the more

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,960
you have, the worse it is fossil is

117
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,240
equal to 1 kg of CO2. The way it works

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,400
is governments would issue fossil tokens

119
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,680
to fossil fuel producers. So the more

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
fossil fuels you produce, the more

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,880
tokens you get.

122
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,199
Next, businesses that receive tokens

123
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
have to pass on their tokens to the

124
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,320
people they're selling their products

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
to. And this goes throughout the supply

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,680
chain. We often have very lengthy supply

127
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,160
chains, but eventually we sell products

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,400
to actual people. And those people start

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,479
accumulating the tokens in their bank

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,639
account. Let's have an example. This is

131
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,440
Jill. She works at Steamy Beans

132
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,039
Cafe. And the cafe uses electricity as

133
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,880
well as coffee

134
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,039
beans. So both of those require some

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,520
amount of fossil fuels to produce. And

136
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,600
so when Jill receives electricity, she

137
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,120
receives some tokens with that. And when

138
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,199
Jill receives the coffee beans, she also

139
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,360
receives some tokens. Then she's going

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,440
to produce some coffee cups. And those

141
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
tokens get allocated among those coffee

142
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,000
cups. And let me just pause here because

143
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,440
this is an important step. Um what

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,039
happens if those coffee cups are not the

145
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
same? I mean, if they're same, every

146
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,600
coffee cup has the same number of

147
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
tokens. But what if one is bigger than

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
the other? This is what we call

149
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,120
allocation. Maybe one coffee cup will

150
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
get more tokens than the other. That's

151
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,280
okay. The main rules to remember here is

152
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,039
that we want allocation to be faithful

153
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,440
to the concept that one token is equal

154
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,199
to one kilogram of CO2 and that it's

155
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,840
simple enough to implement. So maybe we

156
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,600
will have exceptions for smaller

157
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,520
businesses. And finally, the coffee cups

158
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,639
and the coffee goes to the end users and

159
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,319
they receive the tokens in their bank

160
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,120
accounts. Now, how do these tokens

161
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,240
actually move through the system? Well,

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,400
I propose that the tokens are actually

163
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,039
managed by the banks. So, each of these

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,039
companies has a bank account and a bank

165
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,759
and Steamy Beans Cafe is going to pay

166
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,960
for the coffee. But when Steamy Beans

167
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,880
Cafe sends the tokens over, in exchange

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,039
sends the money over, sorry, in exchange

169
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,599
tokens are sent and then the coffee

170
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,599
beans are also sent.

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,360
So to recap, tokens are handled by the

172
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,000
banks and transferred upon

173
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,919
payment. And that's that. And finally,

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,240
for the last part, I'd like to read a

175
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,160
segment of my essay that hopefully will

176
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,160
try to give a story as to how this is

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,160
not so far out of reach of where we are

178
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,160
today.

179
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Global greenhouse gas emissions declined

180
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,759
for a second consecutive year announced

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,400
an international committee of climate

182
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,880
scientists this morning. Such an event

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,680
hasn't occured since the 1991 collapse

184
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,440
of the Soviet Union. This time, however,

185
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
improvements of in quality of life

186
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,360
haven't slowed. How did we get here? In

187
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,520
my retelling, our story starts in the

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,520
city of Calgary, Alberta in

189
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,599
2025. Jamal and Paul Pavlov were

190
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,160
brothers and gym bros. Yes, you know

191
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,000
what I mean. Gym bros, those dead pan

192
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
bulky men in skimpy outfits who emit

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,319
tiny grunts when they lift their heavy

194
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,680
but not that heavy

195
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,440
weights. If you ever start a

196
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,879
conversation with one, you'll find

197
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
they're surprisingly friendly and

198
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,319
pleasant to chat with once you get past

199
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,720
the unsolicited financial advice.

200
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,599
Connoisseurs of the gymro type also know

201
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
of their obsession for nutrition. Fueled

202
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
by gooey green protein shakes, they

203
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
measure, track, and allocate their

204
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,279
intakes of fats, carbohydrates, and

205
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,000
proteins at every meal. But back in

206
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,000
2025, doing so was a tedious task. Apps

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
like My Fitness Pal would help them scan

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,760
the barcodes on their grocery items to

209
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
automatically sum up the nutritional

210
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,320
content of their grocery runs. Still,

211
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
scanning every grocery item with your

212
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
phone's camera was like going through

213
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,000
selfch checkckout twice, but worse.

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,360
Jamal and Paul had the brilliant idea to

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,640
launch a credit card for Jim Bro's flex

216
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,480
card. Its particularity was that it

217
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,160
recorded not only the usual transaction

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,200
data but also data on which items were

219
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,560
purchased. This way users could

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,080
automatically obtain the groceries

221
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,160
nutritional content without scanning any

222
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,600
barcodes. The startup was a success.

223
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,200
Tabloids printed headlines like

224
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,360
astonishing new credit card to become

225
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,959
ripped in 50 days.

226
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,120
While it's hard to verify the card's

227
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,760
effect on muscular gains, Flex Card was

228
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,080
truly astonishing. Unlike Costco,

229
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
Walmart, Target, and Amazon, who had

230
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,240
previously launched branded credit

231
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,080
cards, Jamal and Paul had no leverage to

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
negotiate a deal with the banks.

233
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
Instead, they had to get their cards

234
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,680
issued via Stripe, a financial service

235
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,320
provider that kept a significant cut of

236
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,000
the transaction fee revenues. Moreover,

237
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
the payment terminals that the cards

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,680
interfaced with didn't have access to

239
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,399
the purchase data they needed to

240
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,040
collect. Only the cash register software

241
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
knew the details of what was being

242
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,760
purchased. Undaunted, the brothers

243
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,080
offered to share their profits with

244
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,320
Safeway, a popular supermarket chain,

245
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,000
under the condition that it tweak its

246
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,680
cash register software to make the

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,839
purchase data available to consumers

248
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,440
through their credit cards. Their

249
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
solution around the payments terminal's

250
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,519
restricted capabilities was particularly

251
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,040
innovative. The cash register software

252
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
would post an encrypted copy of the

253
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,959
purchase data online and send the

254
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
requisite decryption key to Flex Card

255
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,200
via an unused field in the payment

256
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,040
terminals transaction protocol. The

257
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
gambit worked once Safeway upgraded

258
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,079
their software. Other supermarkets

259
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,360
followed suit, afraid of losing out on

260
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,959
Calgary's lucrative Jim Bro

261
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,959
clientele. Flex Card quickly proved too

262
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,720
popular for its own good. Many

263
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
restaurants and fast food chains happen

264
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,240
to be using the same cash register

265
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
software as the supermarkets and

266
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
therefore easily upgraded their system

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,399
to support Flex Card. Weight loss apps,

268
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,640
grocery list apps, medical apps, travel

269
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,560
apps, and budgeting apps all requested

270
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
integration of Flex Card data into their

271
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
platform, which the brothers gladly

272
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
agreed to for a substantive fee. All

273
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,320
sorts of shoppers began switching to

274
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,680
Flex Card, and the banks issuing regular

275
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
credit cards became frightened.

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,800
Groceries amount to 20% of credit card

277
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,880
spending and profits. Suddenly, every

278
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,959
major Canadian bank upgraded its credit

279
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,640
and debit cards to Transact Plus, a

280
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,480
nearly identical replica of the

281
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
transaction protocol Flex Card had

282
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,440
pioneered, only renamed to avoid

283
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
trademark litigation. Before long, Flex

284
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,160
Card had been superseded by Transact

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,160
Plus. The banks had won. Unforese

286
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,920
unforeseeably to all involved, Jamal and

287
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
Paul had triggered a historic chain of

288
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,000
events. Through Flex Card, they had

289
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,760
created and popularized a system that

290
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,160
enabled banks and financial service

291
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,279
providers to track alongside standard

292
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,399
monetary data whatever non-monetary data

293
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,519
sellers were willing or required to

294
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,279
provide. This development caught the

295
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,040
attention of Elizabeth Nash, director of

296
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,959
the policy evaluation department of

297
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,040
environment and climate change Canada.

298
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,200
She directed her team to write what we

299
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,200
know now know as the fossil token

300
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,720
proposal. While you'll have to keep

301
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
reading this essay to know the details,

302
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,360
suffice to say, the proposal was adopted

303
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,880
for political reasons, and today's news

304
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,040
speaks to its

305
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,040
effect. Thank

306
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,399
you. Are you

307
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,639
done? Thank you so much, Martin. Now,

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,880
questions. Hands up. Hands up. Hands up.

309
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,639
So I'm wondering if you could talk about

310
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,959
the So one very notable contrast between

311
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,880
the fitness flex card case and the

312
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,200
climate change case is that the climate

313
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,720
change case raises a collective action

314
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,519
problem that isn't present in the

315
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,920
fitness case. So uh it might be that

316
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,480
people are willing to say I'd spend I'd

317
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,800
be willing to spend 1% I think the data

318
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,320
was of of my income on an effective

319
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
climate solution. But they might be

320
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,800
thinking uh an effective climate

321
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,399
solution would be one in which there's

322
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,920
collective action. It's not if I'm just

323
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
unilaterally doing that, it won't be

324
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,920
effective. So they're imagining a

325
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,720
situation in which people in general

326
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,920
sacrifice 1%. But there's nothing about

327
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,240
the design of your climate token system

328
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,720
that does anything to address uh

329
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,800
problems of free writing or really

330
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,800
collective action issues at all. Can you

331
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,320
can you say something on the on from the

332
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,680
point of view of efficacy of how you

333
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
think the collective action problem

334
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,399
would be addressed by this? Yeah, for

335
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,279
sure. A great question. Um, so I think

336
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,360
in many ways the goal of this is to give

337
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,360
consumers the option of being able to

338
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
actually pave towards fighting climate

339
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,200
change. And I think given the statistics

340
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,920
we saw of one in two Americans want to

341
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
do that, um, if it was easy to do, I

342
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,680
think they probably would be do willing

343
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
to do it. Now, not in all cases, of

344
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
course. I mean, I think in some

345
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,720
situations like there to make a

346
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,160
sustainable product will just be a lot

347
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,279
more expensive and so maybe consumers

348
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
won't be willing to pay. But I think

349
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,160
there are a lot of cases where if you're

350
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,040
buying apples or clothing, maybe there

351
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,399
are comparable products in terms of

352
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,079
sustainability that or in terms of

353
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,040
price, but one is a lot more sustainable

354
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,000
and we just don't know about it. So I

355
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,600
think in many cases the collective

356
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,680
action isn't as much of an issue in

357
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,839
those cases where the sustainability

358
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,440
where the price is comparable and I also

359
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,880
think we have a lot of cases where

360
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,880
people making individual decisions

361
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,560
without necessarily being coordinated

362
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,959
end up creating collective action. I

363
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,639
mean if we look at vegetarianism if 20

364
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,160
years ago it was a lot less of a thing

365
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
than today but each of that like

366
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
everyone who decided to become

367
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,519
vegetarian did that as an individual and

368
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,639
today we see a lot of restaurants

369
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,639
offering different menus right

370
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,560
sorry oh sorry thank you so much I

371
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,560
wonder if you could speak to the sort of

372
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,639
personal infrastructure decisions that

373
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,079
are going to be a bit more um that are

374
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
going to matter a bit more in the in the

375
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,959
broader scheme such as solar cell

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,800
installation on our roofs or or our heat

377
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,560
pumps or our electric vehicles and

378
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,639
particularly these higher expense

379
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
options that require maybe also kind of

380
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,279
uh pulled infrastructure to try to

381
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,360
invest in. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I

382
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,760
think when we look at for example, a lot

383
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,000
of the data centers today are spending a

384
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,839
decent amount of money to get clean

385
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
energy for their data centers and that's

386
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,760
partly because they want to be able to

387
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,440
say that um they they're running on

388
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,720
clean power. And so I think when

389
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,920
consumers actually care um or or are

390
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,480
enabled to care then companies react to

391
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,560
that and we see companies spending uh

392
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,560
money on all kinds of initiatives that

393
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,240
are for attracting consumers especially

394
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,360
in big industries that are consumerf

395
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,519
facing like fashion. So I I think those

396
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,240
high capex expenditures especially when

397
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,240
they're amotized over so many products

398
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,000
um are are feasible but of course this

399
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,839
is not like a catch-all solution. And I

400
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,360
think there will be cases where um we

401
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,399
need different solutions as well. Great.

402
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,920
Um thank you so much. Um what are the

403
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,800
consequences of accumulating a lot of

404
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,279
tokens and so uh let's say I I just

405
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,240
stash it all up in my bank account. What

406
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,920
happens to me next? Yeah. So in the

407
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,320
version I envision of this, this is not

408
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,839
like some kind of way to blame consumers

409
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
for accumulating tokens. I think there

410
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,360
should be no consequences to

411
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
accumulating tokens. Um, I think the

412
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,040
real benefit of this is not in making

413
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,440
people feel guilty, but rather in terms

414
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,839
of giving them the choice when they're

415
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,279
shopping. Um, but I mean, you could

416
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,680
envision different systems that do that

417
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,839
differently. But the way I would propose

418
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,000
this is your token information is as

419
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,160
private as your financial information to

420
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,800
kind of prevent any of those concerns.

421
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,720
Great.

422
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,480
Hi. So, I take it that clean energy

423
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,759
sources are more expensive than the

424
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,399
fossil fuels. That's part of the

425
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,680
problem. Yes. I'm worried I'm wondering

426
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,519
what you think about, you know,

427
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,800
technological ways of avoiding your

428
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,320
technological solution. So, companies

429
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,680
might try to find alternative ways to

430
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,600
pay for their energy. They don't go by

431
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,320
way of banks and then the banks aren't

432
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,639
sending them any fossil tokens since

433
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,959
they're using cash or they're using

434
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,560
Bitcoin or something like that. and then

435
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,199
they can sell their cheaper products and

436
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,680
they don't have the number of tokens

437
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,920
that appear on the product doesn't equal

438
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,919
or represent the accurate account of how

439
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,760
much fossil fuels being used. Yeah,

440
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,760
that's a great question and I think in

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,720
my essay I talk a bit about fraud and

442
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,880
dishonest mechanisms. Um so a few of

443
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,799
them is you could for example try to

444
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
sell or like transfer all your tokens to

445
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,919
someone who really doesn't care about

446
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,520
climate change and then give everyone

447
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,360
else lower tokens. Um, the idea of this

448
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,760
token allocation rule is to prevent

449
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,919
that. Um, but still there there probably

450
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,360
are mechanisms to do it. I mean, I think

451
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,720
we have a tax system. There are

452
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,400
definitely loopholes in the tax system.

453
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,039
It's not necessarily a reason not to

454
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
have taxes. Um, you're always going to

455
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,799
find loopholes, but I think with good

456
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,000
government regulation, there are ways to

457
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,000
to prevent the worst offenders.

458
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,280
Is there a risk that suddenly even

459
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,039
though you know some large fraction of

460
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,440
people might really care about this and

461
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,440
want to not accumulate lots of tokens

462
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,200
that you'll get some counterculture of

463
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,520
people who take pride in accumulating

464
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,880
lots of tokens and that those might

465
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,160
actually then be an opportunity to

466
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,559
arbitrage because now the companies can

467
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,919
launder all their tokens to those people

468
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,160
who want more tokens.

469
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,919
Um, yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think

470
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,360
there are memes online of people being

471
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,080
like, "Oh, I ate twice the amount of

472
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,080
meat today to like make up for all the

473
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,080
vegetarians."

474
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,000
Um, I mean, in terms of kind of

475
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,919
offloading your tokens to specific

476
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,600
consumers, I think if you follow like

477
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,600
typical carbon accounting rules, the

478
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,039
idea is basically that uh the tokens

479
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,559
represent CO2. So, you can't just

480
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,120
allocate all your tokens based on how

481
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,559
consumers want. And in the essay, I go a

482
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
bit more in depth into like specific

483
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,000
rules that could achieve that to some

484
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,960
extent. Um, so I think it would be

485
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,480
challenging to just arbitrage between

486
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,640
consumers. But yeah, great. I I think

487
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,559
it's hard to imagine tracking something

488
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,440
and not having it um the monitoring be

489
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,840
used at some point, right? And so uh

490
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,080
much like a credit score, right? If you

491
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,640
track something, then some entity that

492
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,960
has access to that will use it. it's

493
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,120
going to be used and so have you thought

494
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,280
through you know in this sort of credit

495
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,919
score like situation

496
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,600
um you know it it does have uh

497
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
downstream effects even when we think

498
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,120
about things like food stamps or SNAP

499
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,400
benefits right where um there are you

500
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,480
know some rules about what you're

501
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,960
allowed to buy using those and some

502
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,640
people maybe blame people who are using

503
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,320
food stamps and saying well they

504
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
shouldn't be buying soda or they

505
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,480
shouldn't be buying candy whatever it is

506
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
right you could imagine Analogously,

507
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,760
once you're tracking something, if

508
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,480
there's some sort of monitoring, people

509
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,240
would say, "Well, you're poor, you don't

510
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,760
get to have fresh food because that

511
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,400
costs a lot of carbon. What are you

512
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,080
contributing?" Because we're tracking

513
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,000
it. What systems do you imagine putting

514
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,919
in place to stop the tracking of

515
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
something from becoming the policing

516
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,799
probably for people who don't have as

517
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,559
much power? Yeah, for sure. Um I mean I

518
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,840
think as I briefly mentioned earlier a

519
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,760
big part would be ensuring that there

520
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,919
are data privacy laws so that this

521
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,200
information cannot be like reshared. I

522
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,880
mean, a a a simple way could also be um

523
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,320
having the data be deleted, like instead

524
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,000
of having it accumulate in your bank

525
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,919
account, you could just every month like

526
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,120
clear the the database, right?

527
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,640
Um at the end of the day, I mean, you

528
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
could always imagine a government

529
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,240
turning somewhat evil and deciding to

530
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,160
collect this in the back end and that

531
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,919
kind of stuff, but I think the neat part

532
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,360
about having the banks handle the tokens

533
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,720
rather than the government itself is

534
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,000
that it's somewhat decentralized. I

535
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
mean, you could switch banks and the

536
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,880
different bank would have a different

537
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,320
software system. Um so yeah I I think

538
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
there are ways to mitigate this but I

539
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,400
absolutely think like that is a concern

540
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,320
that should be looked at. Great. Thank

541
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,840
you. Uh thank you for sharing. Uh this

542
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,679
is a topic that I'm personally very

543
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,120
interested in and uh during my

544
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,880
conversation with other people about

545
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,480
this. I've received two I think

546
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,320
difficult questions that I want to hear

547
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,039
your thoughts on it. So you can pick one

548
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,640
to to answer. Um so the first one is u

549
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,559
as we all know this is not this is a

550
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,240
fascinating idea but it's definitely lot

551
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,080
not like happening. It's not like the

552
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,679
new idea that just started this year.

553
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,919
We've seen it in policy. It's called

554
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,200
personal carbon allowance. At individual

555
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,200
level, you know, we all have a carbon

556
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
wallet. If we emit more than that, we

557
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,159
have to buy quota from other

558
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,799
individuals. From business, there is

559
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,840
that especially in transportation

560
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,760
sector. Uh if you choose sustainable uh

561
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,679
travel mode, you gain credits and that

562
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,480
credits can be used to redeem something.

563
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,320
So the question that I receive is that

564
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,840
this is a fascinating idea but then what

565
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,840
do you think is the bottleneck that make

566
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,960
it not happen today like why is it not

567
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,440
here and then the second question you

568
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,000
can choose one to answer is that uh in

569
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,280
terms of carbon emission we have a

570
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
production side and then the consumption

571
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,159
side we're talking about consumption

572
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,039
side right now but we all know that

573
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,039
there are looking at a sheer amount the

574
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,520
amount on the production side that we

575
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,440
can reduce is much larger than we can do

576
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,440
on the consumption side. So why should

577
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,480
we focus on consumer instead of

578
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,159
producer? Thank you. Yeah, I mean can I

579
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,600
answer both or

580
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,200
um I'll start with the second um so

581
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,799
production ver the consumption side

582
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
versus production. I think it's really

583
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,200
challenging to directly limit

584
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,080
production. I mean some countries have

585
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,480
done it to some extent. Um but it and

586
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,960
and it is to to be clear it is effective

587
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
to some extent because when you limit

588
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,559
production you increase costs and then

589
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,080
some people move away but at the end of

590
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,760
the day it is not going to be fully

591
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
effective. You also need to be able to

592
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,440
limit um consumption because if you just

593
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,600
limit production people are also going

594
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,080
to just move elsewhere and get um their

595
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,919
fossil fuels from another country for

596
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:39,919
example. So I think limiting consumption

597
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,679
is equally important and yeah um for

598
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,760
your first question as to remind me

599
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:48,880
the the topic.

600
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,799
Oh, right. Right. So, um I think the big

601
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,320
part about this is that in the way I've

602
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,480
presented it is that it's a government

603
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,240
that's implementing it. And when you

604
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,679
have a startup that comes up and says,

605
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,440
"Hey, we're going to do personal carbon

606
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,039
accounting." Um it just becomes one of

607
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,200
those other eco labels. Some people will

608
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,880
join, some people won't, people will

609
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,720
trust it, people will trust it less. I

610
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
think to really make change and this

611
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,600
comes back to the collective action

612
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,840
problem like maybe the organizing

613
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,559
mechanism to do collective action is

614
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,480
having a government supported by its uh

615
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,240
constituents actually go forwards with

616
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,720
this proposal and and bring people

617
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,640
along. So yeah that would be my main

618
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,919
thing. Well there were I think a

619
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,919
thousand questions and we got through

620
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,799
sort of seven of them but uh thank you

621
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,799
so much. Thank you so much.
