1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,120
I'll be talking about specifically

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,760
scheduling considerations in the US

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,599
asylum system. This work has been led by

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,800
my PhD student when Wang and it is also

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,920
joined with uh David Houseman who is an

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,480
professor at UC Berkeley Law School. The

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,199
motivation of this work is twofold. On

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,039
the one hand, there seems to be based on

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
these headlines

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,320
uh a lot of people that believe that the

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,480
US asylum system is in some way broken

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,280
or needs

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,960
fixing. And a lot of this relates to

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,559
issues that for an operations management

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:50,640
person or a scheduling optimization

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:53,440
person relate to issues with the asylum

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,120
system as a service system. Meaning

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,079
there are jobs that are coming in

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,879
applications they need to be processed

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,040
and this is not happening in a fast and

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,080
efficient manner. Now the people that

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,880
usually study service systems don't seem

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,320
to study the asylum system very much.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,000
This is just uh different search terms

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,560
and the number of results that you

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,040
get when you look at uh informs pups

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
online that is like the online library

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,840
of the operations research and

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,040
management sciences main journals and

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
you can see that in there's a lot of

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,479
studies on hospitals because a lot of

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,240
people in our fields study scheduling in

33
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,320
hospitals. There's a lot of research on

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,280
mobility because a lot of people study

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,799
transportation and bus schedules and

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,759
there's a lot of results that study any

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,479
kind of scheduling problem but there are

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,640
barely any papers that even include the

39
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,320
word

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,240
asylum. Now before I get to our own work

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,520
let me just start by highlighting what

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,680
is asylum because not everybody may

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,440
know. In the US, asylum is one of two

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,440
primary humanitarian immigration

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,599
benefits. The other one is that of the

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,720
status of a

47
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:21,120
refugee. So, in order to become a

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,800
refugee, people have to be one outside

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,520
of the United States. Two, they need to

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,080
demonstrate that they were persecuted

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,840
due to one of several protected

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,720
categories. And finally, they need to

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,519
not already be firmly resettled in

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,400
another

55
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:46,319
country. Now, in order

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,720
to receive asylum, one needs to meet the

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,640
definition of a refugee except for one

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,720
needs to already be physically in the

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,160
United

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,080
States. There are two pathways to

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,800
asylum. Gets a little bit wonky here.

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
One is affirmative asylum. This gets

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
adjudicated through an interview with an

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,000
asylum officer at USCIS. And this is for

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
people that don't currently have

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,040
deportation proceedings against them.

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,519
And the other is defensive asylum, which

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,000
gets adjudicated in immigration court.

69
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
And it is for people that already have

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,200
deportation proceedings against them.

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,120
Both of these settings actually have

72
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,360
quite interesting scheduling components

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,560
to them and we've done some work on

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,159
these. My focus will really be on the

75
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
first one, the affirmative asylum

76
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,680
setting. I will try to give you a little

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,599
bit of background on the affirmative

78
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
asylum

79
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,519
adjudication. I tried to show you some

80
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,159
idiosyncrasies of this setting and how

81
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,360
scheduling affirmative asylum cases is

82
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,159
really quite different from scheduling

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,159
surgeries in a hospital.

84
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,640
I'll try to describe a mathematical

85
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,400
model of the affirmative asylum system

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,439
and this is going to be more on the

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
conceptual side to be clear and then I

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,879
will highlight the effect of different

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,720
scheduling policies and their efficiency

90
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,280
properties highlight fairness

91
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,760
considerations in the scheduling and

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,079
show you how some of this plays out

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,440
historically on actual data. So how do

94
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,880
affirmative asylum cases get

95
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,440
adjudicated? It begins with an asylum

96
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,720
seeker submitting a form I589 and their

97
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,759
biometrics and then USCIS scheduling an

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,639
interview. This little arrow here could

99
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,759
take weeks or it could take years. That

100
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,199
is the big scheduling

101
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,120
question. Then there's an asylum officer

102
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,160
that needs to prepare for the interview.

103
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,280
that in includes reading the

104
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,120
application, learning more about the

105
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,280
country of origin of the asylum

106
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,520
applicant, doing background checks,

107
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,360
preparing interview questions. Then is

108
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,960
the actual interview and that is

109
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,240
supposed to check for credibility and

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,199
eligibility and make sure that there

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,880
aren't any other bars to asylum. I won't

112
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,720
go into the details of these, but there

113
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,000
are various that exist and could

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,919
preclude somebody from being granted

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,960
asylum. Based on the interview, there's

116
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,919
some uh written assessment that gets

117
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,240
checked by a supervisor and then asylum

118
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,520
is either granted, the case is referred

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,479
to immigration court or it's

120
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,960
denied. Now, there are various

121
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,639
operational goals of the asylum system.

122
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,560
I want to focus on the ones that are

123
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,120
most operational in nature that are most

124
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,320
closely related to the scheduling which

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,039
are timely processing and efficient use

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,400
of resources. What are resources? It's

127
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,120
the time of the asylum

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,440
offices. Now, timely processing, if you

129
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,759
look over the last 15 years at the

130
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,880
backlog of affirmative asylum cases,

131
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,720
it's gone from a few thousand to more

132
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,680
than a million.

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,000
That means that a lot of cases clearly

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,520
are not being processed in a timely

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,600
manner. Now it also means from an

136
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
operational perspective that we have a

137
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,080
service system that is overloaded.

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,520
Meaning that the arrival rate, the

139
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,919
number of applications that are being

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
filed is much larger than what we would

141
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,319
call the service rate, the number of

142
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,479
cases that are being adjudicated.

143
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,440
In operations, we usually think of

144
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,759
various solutions to such an overloaded

145
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,880
service system. One can try to increase

146
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,639
capacity. One can try to reduce demand,

147
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,880
for example, by increasing the cost of

148
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,360
an application for various political

149
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,919
reasons and practical reasons. That

150
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,960
seems to be complicated or that is

151
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,759
complicated in this application.

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,080
But there's another aspect that is

153
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,520
different about this

154
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,720
application and that is that applicants

155
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
actually receive a work permit while

156
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
they wait for the interview. They don't

157
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,039
receive it immediately. About 6 months

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,560
after applying, one can receive a work

159
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,960
permit. What does that imply? It implies

160
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,680
that for some

161
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,199
applicants or some potential

162
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,160
applicants there might be a benefit for

163
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,560
having a longer wait. Why would that be

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,520
the case?

165
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,479
Because if one believes that one won't

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,720
necessarily be granted asylum, then

167
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,440
having a longer weight would mean that

168
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,160
one would be able to work legally for

169
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,400
longer.

170
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,639
And that means that the idea that we

171
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,360
would want a short backlog and short

172
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,039
wait times is actually not shared by all

173
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,160
potential system

174
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,039
participants. This may sound like a

175
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,479
crazy notion but U Jadu who was director

176
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,960
of USCIS during the last administration

177
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,360
actually highlighted that this was found

178
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,280
to be the case. Some individuals

179
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
realized that due to processing delays,

180
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,879
they could file non-marriitarious asylum

181
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,280
applications and receive employment

182
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,440
authorization before their cases were

183
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,800
reviewed. So at least it was being

184
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,639
suspected that this was happening. Now I

185
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,000
want to highlight sort of how this

186
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,280
changes the dynamics of a service

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,199
system. Traditionally when we think

188
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,960
about a service system, for example,

189
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,800
this box here could be a Starbucks

190
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,000
store.

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,039
We will have people that arrive and they

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,800
will decide whether or not to join based

193
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,440
on the difference between the benefit

194
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,719
from the service. If it's a Starbucks,

195
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,919
that would be drinking a latte and the

196
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,839
cost from waiting in

197
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,959
line. So, we have some people that don't

198
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,719
want to wait. If there's a long queue,

199
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,640
that means there's a long wait. If

200
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,480
there's a long wait, some of these

201
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,440
people will leave and the queue gets

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,519
shorter. That is how we think about

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
service

204
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:56,399
systems. Now, what if there's utility

205
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,519
from waiting? Well, if we have a

206
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,720
somewhat long queue with a long wait,

207
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,839
then we're going to have more arrivals

208
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,040
leading to an even longer

209
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,440
queue. And if we have a short

210
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,360
queue with short waits, then we're going

211
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,440
to have even fewer arrivals and an even

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
shorter queue.

213
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
So, not only do we have here an

214
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,519
overloaded service system, and of

215
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,080
course, I want to highlight this is

216
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,760
very, very

217
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,800
stylized, but it's an overloaded service

218
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,760
system where traditional approaches to

219
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,519
optimize scheduling don't

220
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,240
apply because traditional approaches

221
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,680
don't model people that are seeking to

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,160
wait. They model people that are

223
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,240
avoiding weight, which to be fair is

224
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,839
what happens in most other settings that

225
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,880
we can think of from Starbucks to

226
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,120
hospitals to anywhere

227
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,760
else. Now, we're trying to model this in

228
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,240
the following way. We'll have an

229
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
iterative model that evolves over

230
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,279
periods.

231
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,399
In every period, the scheduling policy

232
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,760
together with the rate of incoming

233
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,720
applications will determine how long

234
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,640
people wait. This could be a fixed

235
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,120
number or it could be a distribution

236
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,519
over different

237
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,800
numbers. But then in the next period,

238
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,160
the previous weight determines the rate

239
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,360
of incoming

240
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,519
applications. And we will be interested

241
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,600
in the equilibrium of this meaning the

242
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,240
limiting behavior as we keep updating

243
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,640
this. How many applicants how many

244
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,160
weight seeking applicants do we or

245
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,360
weight driven applicants do we

246
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,839
observe? And in particular what we would

247
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,480
like to answer is how is this affected

248
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,160
by scheduling policies and how does the

249
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,000
initial rate of incoming arrivals affect

250
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
the outcome.

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,040
Now there's a informal theorem statement

252
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,760
here written but really what we're

253
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,680
trying to get at to to summarize it is

254
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,560
that there are two possible outcomes

255
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,000
under both a FIFO and a LIFO scheduling

256
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,200
policy. FIFO is what you think of at

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,160
Starbucks. People get served in the

258
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,560
order in which they come in. LIFO would

259
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,519
mean that people get served in reverse

260
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,800
order. The person that got in last gets

261
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,000
served next.

262
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,440
Um this is illustrated somewhat in these

263
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,240
plots and you can see that

264
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,720
for FIFO there's a point where FIFO

265
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,800
converges to a congested equilibrium

266
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,600
while LIFO converges to still the no

267
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,440
weight equilibrium. And on the plot all

268
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,079
the way over here, you can see that both

269
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,920
converge to congested equilibria, but

270
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,600
the life for one is actually

271
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,519
smaller. In our model, at least this is

272
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,760
not a

273
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:55,200
coincidence. In fact, we can prove that

274
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,399
across all scheduling policies, LIFO

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,200
would minimize the arrival rate and the

276
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,399
the queue length, whereas FIFO would

277
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,120
maximize it.

278
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,560
Now, should

279
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,200
USCIS schedule arrivals in a life for

280
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:17,480
manner? Meaning, should the most recent

281
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:21,040
applications be processed

282
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,839
first? I mean, most people would say no,

283
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,399
that's a very weird suggestion, but that

284
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,240
is actually what's been

285
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,480
happening. So, for most of the last 30

286
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,320
years, that has been the scheduling

287
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,040
policy. There's a letter signed by more

288
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,600
than 60 representatives of the US House

289
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,120
from four years ago highlighting that

290
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,120
this causes significant harm. In

291
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
particular, older meritorious cases have

292
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
languished for years. As a result,

293
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
individuals who have experienced

294
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,040
significant trauma are left in limbo,

295
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,920
often separated from their families

296
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,839
while their applications are

297
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,519
pending. Why does that happen? Well,

298
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,839
under LIFO, if you're in an overloaded

299
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,880
system, if you don't get processed,

300
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,240
you're stuck in the backlog

301
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,720
forever. So, we now have people that

302
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,320
have entered the backlog 10 years ago.

303
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,079
And if we continue to process by LIFO,

304
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,279
there will always be other people that

305
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,720
get prioritized before

306
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:24,800
them. How does USCIS react to that?

307
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,600
Life was a critical tool in controlling

308
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,120
non-mritorious or fraudulent

309
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,200
applications filed only to obtain

310
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,279
employment

311
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,760
authorization. Going by our theoretical

312
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,200
results, that is a reasonable

313
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,160
response. But then they also say that

314
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,920
they actually haven't been using

315
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,600
LIFO. Rather they allocate some

316
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,399
resources to the completion of the

317
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,040
oldest cases and some resources to the

318
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,680
completion of the newest cases.

319
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,440
So in a sense they are doing a hybrid of

320
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,480
life and fifer. They split their

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,399
capacity between oldest and

322
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,800
newest which begs the question if that

323
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,880
is the right way to interpolate between

324
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,560
the

325
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,440
two. We can again look at our

326
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,800
theoretical model and we would like to

327
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,160
measure the fairness of such a hybrid

328
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,399
policy and the way we want to measure

329
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,320
fairness and this is to some extent

330
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,880
subjective. This is how usually people

331
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,920
think about fairness in a queuing system

332
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,760
is how often does somebody waiting in

333
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,639
line experience that somebody who joined

334
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,399
after them gets served before them. It's

335
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,800
a reasonable fairness definition. I'm

336
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,440
not going to claim that it's the only

337
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,519
one. If you go with this fairness

338
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,839
definition, something weird happens.

339
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,199
This hybrid scheduling policy that's

340
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,680
trying to interpolate between FIFO and

341
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:50,199
LIFO can actually be worse than just

342
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,839
LIFO.

343
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,760
Meaning in this direction things become

344
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,760
more

345
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:01,040
unfair. In this direction the backlog

346
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,519
grows larger. As we said before FIFO

347
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,720
maximizes the backlog, LIIO minimizes

348
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,079
the backlog. But in terms of unfairness,

349
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,279
we can actually be strictly worse than

350
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:18,800
we would be if we had just used

351
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:22,399
LIFO. Now, um let me just wrap up by

352
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,360
showing you a few uh plots that are

353
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,360
based on data in New York.

354
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,320
On this plot, I'm just showing you the

355
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,480
quarterly number of decisions and

356
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,839
filings in the four affirmative asylum

357
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,800
cases in the New York

358
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:41,760
office. To the left, the LIFO policy was

359
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,560
in place. Over here, the LIO policy was

360
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:49,279
in place. In between the FIFO policy was

361
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,279
in place in between those red bars.

362
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Now as you can

363
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,800
imagine in between when we had a lot

364
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,399
more applications than we had decisions

365
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,600
the backlog grew

366
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,519
significantly but what I'm showing here

367
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,240
and that is the blue line but what I'm

368
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,440
showing you here also is the black line

369
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,880
which shows you the

370
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,040
unfairness and there I think there's an

371
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,759
interesting insight here which is that

372
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,519
when the backlog is

373
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,120
all. It doesn't matter so much whether

374
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,320
you schedule in LI for or FIFO

375
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,839
ordering because you're not skipping

376
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,720
that many people in line because there

377
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,120
aren't that many people in

378
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:36,040
line. When this backlog grows

379
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:39,920
large, then LIFO is very

380
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:43,160
unfair. But of course there's a question

381
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,240
of whether the growth of the backlog

382
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,320
here had the change of the scheduling

383
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,639
policy to FI for at least as a

384
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,320
contributing

385
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:57,040
factor. So I'll conclude here there's an

386
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,120
interesting aspect to asylum scheduling

387
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,519
that traditional studies of service

388
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,360
systems haven't incorporated. At the

389
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:08,160
same time, there's a lot of expertise in

390
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,360
computing and operations to design

391
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,160
scheduling algorithms.

392
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,640
Hopefully this work can lead to more

393
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,679
research that aims to actually improve

394
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,600
the system and practice and um

395
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,520
highlights that there are

396
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,160
significant decisions in immigration

397
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,960
that are really operational decisions

398
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,280
and that have really significant impacts

399
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,340
on people's lives. I'll stop here. Thank

400
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,200
you very much.

401
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:44,440
[Applause]

402
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,440
Thank you. Questions for Daniel.

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,760
Um so one question in the LIFO strategy

404
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,640
are you able to process more

405
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,640
applications than in the other one? No

406
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,120
the intuition that you should be

407
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,000
thinking of the the capacity is the

408
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,080
same. So that's a a great question. I'm

409
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,840
not trying to change the capacity of the

410
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:25,840
two systems. However, under

411
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:29,760
LIFO, there are more people that end up

412
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,480
not joining the system because they fear

413
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,240
not getting the work permit. And that

414
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,160
makes them less likely to join. And that

415
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,160
then leads to a smaller backlog.

416
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm just curious if anyone has proposed

417
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,120
a maximum wait time at which point the

418
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,400
asylum claim would be automatically

419
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,520
approved. It seems like that might help

420
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,679
with the fairness problem.

421
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,200
Yes. Uh I think that's that's a

422
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,919
wonderful question and uh here I clearly

423
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,679
leave the extent to which the the my

424
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,919
research would provide insights. Um I

425
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,320
think to some extent what you're hinting

426
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,200
at is really that the system has moved

427
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,600
from one

428
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,440
equilibrium where

429
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,360
the processing rule was LIFO but it

430
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,559
didn't really matter much because the

431
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,480
weight was short to another equilibrium

432
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,640
where it doesn't really matter what

433
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,919
scheduling policy you you I mean I don't

434
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,880
want to say it doesn't matter but like

435
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,440
the backlog is there now and there needs

436
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,760
to be a way to deal with it. At this

437
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,559
point, I think most policy makers and

438
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,799
most academics in fields that usually

439
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
study immigration would agree that what

440
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,400
is needed is more substantial

441
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,799
immigration reform rather than sort of

442
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,799
some change to the scheduling

443
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,040
policy. Okay, let's thank Daniel once

444
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,540
again.

445
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,540
