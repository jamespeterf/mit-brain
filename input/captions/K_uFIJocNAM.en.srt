1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,440
Thank you everybody for being here. Um

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,800
we have an announcement about the MPG

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,480
retreat which is in February. Um we're

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
seeking volunteers to join the

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,799
scientific and social planning

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,560
committee. So please take a picture with

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:22,720
your phone or um get that QR code to

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,039
sign up. Um another announcement um next

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,519
week was meeting free week. So we don't

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,800
have primer but the week after that we

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,120
will have a primer from Pamela Robertson

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,239
from the broad clinical labs talking

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,840
about clinical genomic resources um but

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,040
today we have um two speakers from the

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
lab lab um and I'm sorry Sulki Kwan is a

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,000
research scientist one not a post-doal

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,160
associate so sorry about that um but um

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,239
let's see um I had these okay

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,719
Okay. So, Silki is a research scientist

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,559
in computational biology with a focus on

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,359
protein biioiniratics and variant

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,360
interpretation. Her research focuses on

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,000
understanding how genetic variation

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,159
alters protein structure and function

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,960
using computational models to uncover

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,560
mechanisms of disease. And then we have

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,880
Dr. Yu Chan who is a postoc. He is

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
research focuses on developing pipelines

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,880
to interpret structure function

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,080
relationships and base editor tiling

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,159
screen data. He integrates AI, bioysics

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
and structural biology to interpret

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,040
variant effects and guide protein

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,560
engineering. So um great we'll turn it

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
over to you guys.

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,439
>> Yeah good morning everyone. Um um it's a

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:44,240
pleasure to present our genomics to

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,720
portal in the MPG um session.

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
GTP proteins portal is a discovery

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,159
portal uh designed to help researchers

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,479
to link the genetic screening outputs to

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,640
protein sequence and structures. Our

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,320
team is in the bioinformatics and

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,399
machine learning group under the letters

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,320
to cure accelerator at the broad

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
institute.

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,560
Before I dive into the portal, I'd like

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,959
to acknowledge that this was a truly

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,920
team effort. Um and I'd like to thank

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,640
many our collaborators and funders who

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,879
made this uh entire project possible and

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
valuable and thanks to our scientific

53
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,000
illustrators as well to create a

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,280
beautiful um visuals for the portal and

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,680
this work is published in uh 2024. So if

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
anyone is interested in more please uh

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,800
check uh please feel free to check out

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,239
the papers as well.

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Um you know Mr. portal started um on a

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,680
fundamental questions that how we can

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,920
connect um genetic variations all the

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,959
way to the protein structures. So let's

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,160
say a geneticist identify the genomic

64
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,440
variance on the genomic coordinate um it

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,519
it points out the mRNA sequence change

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,800
in a specific transcript and then it

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
translate into the amino acid change and

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,599
um ultimately impact the protein

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,159
structures on the 3D space. So

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,640
understanding this entire flow of the

71
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:13,040
information is uh crucial to understand

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,360
this bio uh to understand the disease

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,480
mechanism and thereby build biological

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,720
hypothesis and therapeutic strategies.

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,560
So understanding how this protein coding

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,840
varants affect protein function is

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,080
crucial uh for translating um genetic

78
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
genomics discovery into the clinical

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,519
insights as well. And here's an example

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,560
of the DXCX gene which encodes RNA

81
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,799
helicase and researchers have identified

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,000
five denovo variants from the patient

83
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,760
fiveense variants from patient and when

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,159
they mapped the variants onto the

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,360
protein 3D structure you can see that

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,840
they are um clustered on a certain

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
regions of the protein which turns out

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
to be really important functional motive

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,640
of the protein which is um the RNA

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,799
binding motive. So this immediately

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,560
suggests that um this mapping um reveals

92
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,519
the mechanisms and suggests the

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,840
mechanism that this disrupting this RNA

94
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
binding ability would uh drive the

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
pathology of the disease. And this is

96
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,680
not only case study. We have many more

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,320
genes where we see a disease mutations

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,880
cluster together and impact uh specific

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,520
protein functions. Your modulin kidney

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,240
disease mutations are clustered in the

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,440
end terminal part of the protein and mor

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,080
2 mutation um is and on the protein

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,000
protein binding interfaces and more

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,479
interestingly in case of the GABA

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,240
receptor you can see the mutations

106
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,600
clustered in different regions of the

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,520
protein actually display a a different

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,520
severity of the phenotypes as well.

109
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,680
So when you actually start looking at

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,800
the data um and the data landscape these

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,600
days you'll notice there's an incredible

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,759
amount of datas available. First u

113
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,479
genetic variation thanks to the high

114
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,440
throughput sequencing technologies. Now

115
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,600
we can identify um clinically relevant

116
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
variants and they are all deposited in

117
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,520
the clean bar databases and we have a

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,320
huge number of um human population data

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,880
population variation deposited on the

120
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,880
NOMA databases and interestingly um if

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,080
you look at the clinical significance

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,600
identified um as a function of time you

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,400
can see the number of variance of

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,880
uncertain significance um is growing

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,520
really fast compared to other variants

126
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:44,080
of of turns out u other variants um of

127
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,800
pathogenic or benign.

128
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,440
So that highlights uh the need for the

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,840
better uh variant interpretation tools.

130
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,520
Second structural biology. We now have

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,960
over 200 million experimentally resolved

132
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,960
structure in the protein data bank and

133
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,520
alphafold is um creating millions of

134
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,080
proteins data. So that suggest we now

135
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,600
have an unprecedented coverage of the

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,919
protein structure for the human

137
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,240
proteome.

138
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,400
And lastly, functional genomics such as

139
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,039
deep mutational scanning experiment is

140
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,000
now testing like hundreds of thousands

141
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,639
of variant at the same time creating a

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,759
rich set of functional datas as well. So

143
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,000
each of these uh field is extremely

144
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,319
valuable on its own but the real power

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,039
can come from when we actually integrate

146
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,199
this data. So our central questions was

147
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,759
how we can usefully integrate this data

148
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,080
and this is what exactly the genomics

149
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
genomics to pertise portal is aiming

150
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,479
for.

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,600
So this our genomics port uh proteins

152
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,400
portal combined multiple databases and

153
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,520
provide this holistic um identifier

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,160
mapping. So if you query a gene you can

155
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,360
see the connections uh of this ensemble

156
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,400
transcript and refi uh to the uniro

157
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,120
protein uh isopform identifiers and to

158
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,599
the structures as well. So if you uh and

159
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,479
then we map a variant on those

160
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,560
transcript u seamlessly all the way to

161
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,160
the proteins 3D structures along with

162
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,960
other protein features that we

163
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,960
integrated as well.

164
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,199
So currently uh the portal integrates

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,800
the genome genetic variation from clean

166
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,000
bargmd which are disease uh related ones

167
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,360
and also human population um varants

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,599
from nomads. So um altogether we

169
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
currently aggregating more than 49

170
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,319
million genetic variations for the human

171
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,639
for the entire human proteium um not

172
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,880
only including uh single nucleotide

173
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,680
variants like miss nonsense synonymous

174
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,840
we also have a non SMV mutations as well

175
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
and we also provide the database

176
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,759
specific filters to make this

177
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,720
interpretation

178
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
uh intuitive so you can actually see uh

179
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,879
varants by their um molecular phenot

180
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,080
types and plus you can see the nomad

181
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,879
variant by LIO frequency or account and

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,759
for clinical uh clean bar variant you

183
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,919
can filter them um by the clinical

184
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,599
significance so you can see like I'm

185
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,199
interested in pathogenic variant I want

186
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,919
to see the benign variant so you can

187
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,919
like opt in and out from the portal

188
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,919
interface

189
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,959
um one of key strengths of the portal is

190
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,039
that we have like the highest structural

191
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,919
coverage. So, um the alpha fold uh

192
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,640
protein structure prediction covers the

193
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,160
structure of more than um 12,000

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,560
proteins

195
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,760
where there's no experimental structures

196
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,360
available at all. So if you get look at

197
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,560
the chart we can able we are able to map

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,680
more than 70% of the nomad variant 50%

199
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,000
40% of the clean varnage GMD variant

200
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,519
where there was no structures available

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,800
then um we can retrieve them um by

202
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,959
incorporating the alpha databases. So

203
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,560
all together in total we were able to

204
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,480
over um we were able to map over 90% of

205
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,279
the variant on the entire human

206
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,839
canonicalizer forms um successfully on

207
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,839
the protein structures.

208
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,320
So now we have a genetic vari um covered

209
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,279
and what uh next step is to layer them

210
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,440
on the protein feature databases. So we

211
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,959
collect many different protein features

212
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,920
from different databases and we provide

213
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,320
um them uh as a category of six

214
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,880
different protein features. So I'll just

215
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,760
briefly introduce what's what that

216
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,839
means. So physical chemical properties

217
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,120
about like the side chain chemistry of

218
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,120
the amino acid like such as polarity

219
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,160
hydrophobicity

220
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
and we also have a full set of premputed

221
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,000
structural features from alpha fold and

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
PDB. So you can see the secondary

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,880
structure annotations um solvent

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,480
accessibility and um importing the

225
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,920
confidence of alpha score and also um

226
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,160
the precomputed um potential binding

227
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,440
sites on the protein surfaces as well

228
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:30,079
from the app pockets

229
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,320
and also from the structure we um

230
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,560
premputee the protein interactions

231
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
within the protein or between the

232
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,720
protein which is this four different

233
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,839
types of chemical bone that you can

234
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,640
identify within the structure

235
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,680
and we also bringing in uh the rich set

236
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,760
of uniro sequence annotations and they

237
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
mainly focus on like the active side

238
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,240
binding side with important functional

239
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,399
sides and domain annotations regions

240
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,079
motive. So you can um pull this uniro

241
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,920
annotations on the sequence viewer all

242
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,959
together with other features as well.

243
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,040
And we bringing in the post transl post

244
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,000
post translation of modifications from

245
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,079
the phosphocosite plus databases as

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,440
well. And lastly we um work with the

247
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,800
mave db which is a public repository for

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,959
data set um from this multiplex essay of

249
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:33,040
the variant effects. So if you if the

250
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:36,240
protein has um a multave data published

251
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,959
in the literature they catalog them and

252
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,519
from the G2P portal we visualize them as

253
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,880
a heat map and it's currently available

254
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,880
in about 500 proteins.

255
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,160
So I'll u we have a two different module

256
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,120
from the genomics to proteins portal.

257
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,760
First one is a resource module where you

258
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,760
can uh search your gene or protein by

259
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,399
their um gene symbol or uniro ID so that

260
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,600
you can access the entire um resources

261
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,839
that we uh put together in the portal.

262
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,920
And the second module is the interactive

263
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,760
module where you can actually upload

264
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,920
your data, your mutation, your

265
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,920
annotation and work with the um known

266
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,000
protein structures or even you can

267
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,760
upload your structure um to

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,320
interactively work with the data.

269
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,600
So I'll briefly uh I'll just walk you

270
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,639
through to the resource module

271
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,800
to the portal. So and the research

272
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,920
module as I described you can search by

273
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,480
gene. So I just search the gene and

274
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,360
it'll take you to the landing page. So

275
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,519
from the landing page you can see the

276
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,839
the generic information about the gene

277
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,360
and protein. So it has a cross reference

278
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,639
to external links to gene card hgnc and

279
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,760
panther. And if there is a known um gene

280
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,000
disease relationship established by JCC

281
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,120
you can see that and you can visit them

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,120
as well. and the uniro link is provided

283
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,240
and it provides the canonical protein

284
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,360
isopform identifier. So if you go down

285
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,839
we have five tabs. The first tab is uh

286
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,000
for the our sequence viewer. So this is

287
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,120
the ma one of the main feature of the

288
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,360
portal. So then you can bring in um and

289
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,079
filter in and out many different um

290
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,320
protein features on the track. So you

291
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,560
can click whatever uh protein feature

292
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,519
that you are interested in and you can

293
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,800
always zoom in and out viewer so that

294
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:41,680
you can click your um regid of interest

295
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,880
and this is by default provided for the

296
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,200
canonical protein isoform. But if your

297
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,360
interest, your protein of interest is

298
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,240
non-cononical protein isopform such as

299
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,480
this -2 protein, you can click it and

300
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,320
then we align it then for you on the

301
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,519
sequence viewer. And you can see there's

302
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,279
a gap um of this in the non-anical

303
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,199
protein isopform. But you can also

304
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,120
translate this full set of um protein

305
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,160
feature annotated here to the

306
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,040
non-cononical isoforms as well. And you

307
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,959
can always screenshot um click by

308
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,040
clicking this to download this high

309
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,000
resolution images of the sequence viewer

310
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,360
that you um customized. And you can also

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,160
download the annotation as a CSV file so

312
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,639
that you can make a you can bring in a

313
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,800
table and analyze um from your own

314
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
pipeline

315
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,880
and also you can just see the tables

316
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,680
here on the website. So click the view

317
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,199
table you can just see like full set of

318
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:46,040
features. um aligned by the protein

319
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,040
residue residue ID

320
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,720
and I'll visit this fourth tab which

321
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,040
shows the table of our um identifier

322
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,680
mapping from gene to transcript to the

323
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,120
protein isoform. So you can see what is

324
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,560
the canonical iso form for this gene um

325
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,120
annotated uh with asteric and you can

326
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,839
see what's the canonical ensemble

327
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,600
transcript here and you can see also for

328
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,560
the refy you can see what's the main

329
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,160
select transcript uh where many of the

330
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,600
clinical variants are annotated on and

331
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,680
go to the uh additional resource um you

332
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,680
can see the um external link to other

333
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,639
databases is about this gene such as US

334
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,920
UCSC Campbell drug bank and the disease

335
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,880
annotation database like om morphanet

336
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,800
and if when there is a mave data

337
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,760
available so I'm bringing in a case

338
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,839
study gene where the mave data is

339
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,720
available if you click the additional

340
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,000
resource tab you can see the preview of

341
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,800
this mave data um as a heat map and you

342
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,320
can always select um the data set

343
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,600
relevant

344
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,759
And it also direct you to this um

345
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,000
reference databases of the MA. So then

346
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,320
you can look at more detailed data and

347
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,320
download it.

348
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,320
And let's go to this uh let's see the

349
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,000
variance now on this sequence viewer

350
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,800
here. So I'll

351
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,480
go to the another case study genes which

352
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,480
is a tozel kynise 2. So if you click

353
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,199
this variant to protein sequence tab,

354
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,880
you can still see this um same sequence

355
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,360
viewer that you have looked at this

356
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,839
protein sequence annotation tab but in

357
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,920
this tab you can bring in the variant

358
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,279
data. So you can uh you need to select

359
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,519
the u transcript here for the mapping

360
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,959
and then now you can see there's a nomad

361
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,519
variance um categorized by their

362
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,839
molecular letter consequences and LIO

363
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,480
counts and LIO frequencies. So you can

364
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,399
click um I'll just show you the

365
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:01,156
multitune nomad missence variant here

366
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,440
and um sometimes you your um transcript

367
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:05,839
[clears throat] where many of where all

368
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,160
of this clinical variants are annotated

369
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,319
is not always encoded the canonical

370
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:16,240
protein iso form. So in this case this

371
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,480
-2 protein is corresponding to the mason

372
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,760
transcript and now all of this uh

373
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,400
clinical data is annotated on this

374
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,600
transcript. So in that case uh to

375
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,919
address this we provide the um mapping

376
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,559
and aligning variant from the another

377
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,039
transcript. So if you click this button

378
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,880
you can select another transcript to be

379
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,600
aligned. So I'll click here to the main

380
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,520
select transcript

381
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,360
and then now you can see this clean bar

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,679
variants annotated on another um protein

383
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,600
which has a gap in the middle now

384
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,919
aligned to the canonical protein

385
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,440
isoform. So you can see those variants

386
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,960
now with the full set of protein feature

387
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,880
annotation um annotated on another

388
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,840
protein sequences.

389
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,440
And you can also view table here to see

390
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,880
Nomad variants and has informations and

391
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,640
also the clean bar variants as well.

392
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,240
Yeah, there's no record because we

393
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,000
selected the canonical prin.

394
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,760
And now we can map those onto the

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,280
protein structure. So if you go to the

396
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:31,679
third tab variant to protein structure,

397
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:36,160
we um list the list of the PDB entries

398
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:39,120
and alpha fold entry. So you can always

399
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,080
um sort them by the method and

400
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,480
resolution or residue count. So if you

401
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,679
are not sure which structure to pick um

402
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,799
I suggest you to pick the most covered

403
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,200
uh PTB structures but we also have a

404
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,280
alpha structure which provide the full

405
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,720
length um structure of the protein as

406
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,520
well. So I'll um go with um the alpha

407
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,919
structure. You can click any any rows

408
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,919
that you want

409
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,919
and you we are now seeing the alpha

410
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,240
whole structures here in the structure

411
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,480
viewer along with the sequence viewer

412
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,039
and you can um see another structures um

413
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,679
of this protein and if you click it you

414
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:25,200
see how these are aligned on the protein

415
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,039
sequence space. So for example, this 7

416
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,840
L0

417
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,720
um PDB is only covering those uh regions

418
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,400
of the protein out of this entire um

419
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,919
length

420
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,919
and I'll just yeah drop it in and you

421
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,640
can if you click the nomad variant I'll

422
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,280
just click the misses nomad variants not

423
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,400
aligned one and I'll show you the

424
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,840
multitone and maybe many all of them is

425
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,240
very rare nomad variation

426
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,600
and Now we have an aligned misense

427
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,080
variant from the -ash2 protein and I'll

428
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,200
click the also the misense variant and

429
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,080
only a pathogenic um clean bar variant.

430
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,600
So if you click this uh track now you

431
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,799
can map them onto the protein structures

432
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,240
you can map it all together

433
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,280
um the clean bar variant together with

434
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
the nomad as well and you can also bring

435
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,440
in um other protein feature annotations

436
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,240
like if you click this amino acid

437
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,000
property color by the property um

438
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,480
surface area alpha hold competence

439
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,760
and the PPIs and active size so I'll

440
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,840
show you um this variance along with the

441
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,080
domain annotation. So from the uniro

442
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,039
it's annotated at the protein kynise

443
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,960
domain here. If you click it um you can

444
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,600
see there's a light blue area where this

445
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,559
domain annotation is located. And if you

446
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,480
you can make a full screen

447
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,559
you can see that this nomad multiden

448
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,280
variant is kind of spread all over the

449
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,400
protein structure. But this clean bar

450
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,520
pathogenic mutation is is uh mostly

451
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,679
populated in this protein kynise domain.

452
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Um not surprisingly it's important

453
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,480
functional um domain of the protein.

454
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:19,480
If you disrupt this um region you'll

455
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,480
you'll get um a disease.

456
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,679
Yeah. And you can download this uh

457
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,000
entire visuals uh that you customize

458
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,919
through the pimole script. so that you

459
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,320
can work further um for your publication

460
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,840
quality figures or other analysis

461
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,000
available in the pimos as well.

462
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,960
Yeah.

463
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,200
So this was a resource module and we

464
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,280
have uh introduced another module which

465
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,760
is interactive module and I'll hand it

466
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,799
over to you John uh to present um and

467
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,799
walk through the interactive module.

468
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,440
So from here I'm going to introduce

469
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,320
interactive model of genomics 2 protein

470
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,760
or shortly G2P portal but I'm going to

471
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,000
want to start with like asking

472
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,080
questions. How many people here have

473
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,280
experience of mapping your experimental

474
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,799
data on 3D structures?

475
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,200
No.

476
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,320
Right. So I didn't expect that but if

477
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,520
you have any experience it's not very

478
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,919
easy. I mean if you have a decent script

479
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,640
it's quite easy to just use it to map

480
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,320
your screen data or experiment value

481
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,720
onto the 3D structure but in short it's

482
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,679
quite tough it it's it could be very

483
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,440
errorrone uh process

484
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,960
I'm going to highlight two things on

485
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,360
this interactive module the first thing

486
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,320
is this interactive module of genomics

487
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,559
to protein portal is super easy to use

488
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,280
literally you can just copy from access

489
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,159
spreadsheet and paste it and then we can

490
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,880
visualize it on the protein structure.

491
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,360
The second part is I guess this just

492
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,880
browsing the available resource on this

493
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,440
DN uh protein is important but more

494
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,039
important application is mapping your

495
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,080
data and then actually see uh alongside

496
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,960
with the other features that the just

497
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,840
key introduce. So you can actually

498
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,200
analyze or interpret better in the like

499
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,200
uh var variants or other structural

500
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,919
feature. So that can help you to

501
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,760
understand your experimental data. So

502
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,799
I'm going to walk you through just one

503
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,799
by one. So the interactive module you

504
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,960
can click this on the right hand side

505
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,240
button and then you'll see the two subm

506
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,520
module here. Uh the first case the most

507
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,799
of first subm module is when you have a

508
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,520
gene or protein identifier like a uni

509
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,440
pro ID and you have your own

510
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,480
experimental value like Excel

511
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,960
spreadsheet then we can start with the

512
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,360
first module. So I'm going to get I'm

513
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:08,039
going to actually have a example DNMA

514
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,039
which is DNA method transferase uh gene.

515
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,880
So if you type it, it'll show you the

516
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:18,559
canonical unro ID here. So which looks

517
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,400
correct. So I'm going to proceed it.

518
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,600
Then it will show you the all the

519
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,320
available protein data bankm

520
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:31,279
3a structures but only for the human not

521
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,400
human nonhumans are not here proteins

522
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,320
are here.

523
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:40,080
Um I'm going to select those uh one

524
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,080
specific structure because the later uh

525
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,760
later part I'm going to introduce the

526
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,559
data which is uh mutational screening uh

527
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,360
or functional screening data and then I

528
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,600
want to see that the mutational data

529
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,400
with a homodimer of this DNF display

530
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,720
protein. So I'm going to select that PTB

531
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,720
has homod.

532
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,600
So if I click this PDB,

533
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:11,120
>> you can actually see uh make it bigger.

534
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,320
Yeah, it looks homodimer here.

535
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,520
And you can also check the coverage of

536
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,360
uh this DNMP 3A gene and their

537
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,200
corresponding PDB here. So it actually

538
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:27,360
cover half of the DNP3A protein. And you

539
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,760
can see that two chains are here.

540
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,559
And you can see the color corresponding

541
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,640
chain A and chain C.

542
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,320
But if the cover is not enough, I mean

543
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,480
if you're more interesting to see the

544
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,039
full coverage from alpha structure, then

545
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,360
you can just move on to the upper tab

546
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:47,480
and you can select the alpha structure

547
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,480
to map your data.

548
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,440
Right? So I'm going to just keep with

549
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,440
the homodimer.

550
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,799
Then we're going to have this uh

551
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,919
annotation view. So here what we're

552
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,840
going to do is putting the experimental

553
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,840
data.

554
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,840
So

555
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:21,039
let me open the Excel. So this is a data

556
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,200
for this mutational function uh scanning

557
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,000
data. I'm going to just copy whole

558
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,039
spreadsheet data and then I'm going to

559
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,039
paste into here

560
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,440
and then submit here. But if you're not

561
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,880
very familiar with this uh the form or

562
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,840
formatting things, you can actually

563
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,559
click here see the example how the

564
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,799
formatting should be followed by this

565
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:49,200
kind for we defined here. So it could be

566
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,960
uh just comma separated or tap separated

567
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,159
but you can have any kind of format uh

568
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,640
any kind of headers like this. I'm going

569
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,240
to show you more uh real case scenarios.

570
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,520
>> So if you submit your data then the

571
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,960
portal automatically process it and then

572
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,679
it'll show you this kind of uh screen.

573
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,799
Then in this step what you need to do is

574
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,760
check whether this data is correct or

575
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,720
not. So for example the first column has

576
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,279
to be always the residue index. It's

577
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,120
because genomics the protein portal

578
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,880
needs to uh has to uh need to map your

579
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,760
data with this column information to the

580
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,640
other genomics to protein resource data.

581
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,760
So this uh column has to be always

582
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,440
rescue index. Um but you can actually

583
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,640
have different column not just position

584
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,159
but something else.

585
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,919
All right. And then I'm going to explain

586
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,360
three things. So you can see that

587
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:58,159
buttons have a different uh labels here,

588
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:02,159
mutations and scores and features.

589
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:06,000
uh each data type has a different

590
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,399
representation. So for example, if I set

591
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,440
this human residue column with this

592
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,399
mutation data type which requires

593
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,720
specific formatting. So I'm going to

594
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,360
just quickly show you

595
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,720
what formatting this mutation column

596
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,360
requires is this first row.

597
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,320
So it was actually invented for uh

598
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,880
showing information with spear

599
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,360
representation in 3D viewer. We're going

600
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,360
to see in the next uh page. Um here I

601
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,760
actually follow this the last uh

602
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:45,520
formatting. So any letter single letter

603
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,520
uh here. So you can see that the second

604
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,080
column has one letter which is Y type

605
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,000
rescue letter.

606
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,880
And the second uh the third column is

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,080
score. If you put any values in this

608
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,760
score column and then define as a score

609
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,399
then you can color your protein with the

610
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,799
gradient or uh continuous gradient

611
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,320
column. So like a red to blue, white to

612
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,159
blue,

613
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,480
anything.

614
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,960
And the last type is a features. So

615
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,360
feature column accepts either value or

616
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,559
string or text.

617
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,960
So I'm going to show you one of the

618
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,960
example here.

619
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:34,960
So I already marked some residue of

620
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,200
interest and their uh location. Oh,

621
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,960
these residues are co-actor binding

622
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,240
site. So I actually type in there

623
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,559
already. And this is a residue in

624
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,279
homodimer interface.

625
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,240
The last column is another way we can

626
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,399
show something. uh so because the

627
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,440
feature column will color this protein

628
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,760
structure but if I have it as a mutation

629
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,240
then I can actually change the represent

630
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,640
representation with the sphere. So you

631
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,799
can just play with your columns with a

632
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,919
different data type to show in different

633
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:11,679
representation in 3D structure here. And

634
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,200
importantly if you have any uh typers or

635
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,520
something you can actually modify from

636
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,320
here

637
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,760
you can change it except the f uh except

638
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,320
this headers here. Okay. So once you

639
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,080
submit your annotations

640
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,880
and you can see that the structure

641
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,039
we selected

642
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,279
um here and then this is color by based

643
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,240
on the selection of events uh the last

644
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,799
sequence view I'm going to color this

645
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,080
one based on the score of this the score

646
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,200
screening the data that I fit in

647
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,399
you can see that the darker purple color

648
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,200
is representing higher the value of the

649
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,600
screening data

650
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,840
and because there are so many uh color

651
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,360
or screening data here and then I

652
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:07,039
actually marked very high scoring region

653
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,919
with mutation data type rotation. So you

654
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:14,080
can actually see that with the sphere as

655
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:18,399
well. So those are having spears have

656
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,799
very darker purple on the protein uh

657
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,679
cartoon as well.

658
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:26,080
So with this information we might be

659
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,600
able to interpret some important

660
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,440
biological

661
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,520
uh things but I'll further go with

662
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,919
adding the genomics to protein resource

663
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,200
features. So if you click this view

664
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,640
additional annotation that is way we can

665
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,799
add features from resource module. So

666
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,480
first I'm going to uh map clean variance

667
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,640
information. You can see there's no

668
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,960
information available because clean

669
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,200
variance informations are mapped onto

670
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,600
the second transcript here. So if you

671
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,559
click the second transcript then now

672
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,720
you'll be see that uh clean bar map on

673
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,640
the second. So I'm going to select miss

674
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,600
sense but only pathogenic variants.

675
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,279
So now we can see that 60 pathogenic

676
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,880
variants

677
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,679
on top of this uh the scores of our

678
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,159
experimental data. Some of them align

679
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,919
well, some of them not. So it actually

680
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,919
give us like some kind of information by

681
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,279
m how the mutations align with the

682
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,200
pathogenic cleanar mutations.

683
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,080
But I'm going to actually add few more

684
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,559
features such as potential small

685
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,720
molecule binding site which is from F

686
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,799
pocket prediction.

687
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,039
You can color the protein structure with

688
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,080
this F pocket. And you can see that

689
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,600
those greenish part is where the small

690
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,640
model can bind. And another important

691
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,480
thing could be here because I was I said

692
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,720
like I'm interesting to see the

693
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:02,320
homodimer context. You can see that

694
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,600
there are three features available which

695
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,080
represent the uh protein protein

696
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,320
interaction side which is coming from

697
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:15,600
analyzing all the DNFT3 PDB and finding

698
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,960
um protein protein interaction residues.

699
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,240
Um okay I colored them here. So this is

700
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,399
this mustard color is showing protein

701
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,640
protein interface residues or

702
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,360
interacting residues in the NMP3

703
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,320
protein.

704
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,880
And if you so I want to actually see

705
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,559
that whether this high scoring residues

706
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,200
are aligning

707
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,960
then you can see that oh okay these two

708
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,760
residues could be very important

709
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,760
mutations in terms of DNF3 function

710
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,240
because this is uh actually happening on

711
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,240
where the protein protein interaction

712
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,240
happen.

713
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,039
Okay. So

714
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,279
>> all right and

715
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,919
those are the feature we can edit on on

716
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,360
and then you can also change this color

717
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,760
by using this edit colors and select a

718
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,119
corresponding features you can change

719
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,240
the scores a color not blue purple but

720
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,520
different colors here.

721
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,320
Okay. Um

722
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,520
and as Seri mentioned

723
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,320
>> can I ask a question? Sorry to

724
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,040
interrupt. Um, I'm wondering about what

725
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,800
to do when you're mapping your mutations

726
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,159
on your favorite protein of interest,

727
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:38,159
but your mutations are not like

728
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,000
obviously segregating to a certain area.

729
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,760
Um, I know that's kind of an open-ended

730
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,280
question, but um, you know, what kind of

731
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,520
statistical tests could you run? Um,

732
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,119
like taking it in taking into account

733
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,280
the 3D structure. Um I mean some of the

734
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,680
things that you showed like the TLK2

735
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,920
it's like nice when it obviously all

736
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,079
goes to the kynise but usually they

737
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,119
don't. So how do you approach those

738
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,440
scenarios?

739
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,880
>> So I'm asking like how we map the

740
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,040
mutations of the protein.

741
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,079
>> Um no um what do you how do you

742
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,119
interpret

743
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,280
>> interpret the mutations

744
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,440
>> interpret the mutations on the structure

745
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,359
when the clinical what you think are

746
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,119
clinically pathogenic variants aren't

747
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,079
mapping obviously to a domain.

748
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,240
Um

749
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,640
>> yeah, we actually have many case many

750
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,440
case studies where we don't have a clear

751
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,359
clusters of course. Um so I'll probably

752
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,839
I was going to preview a little bit but

753
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,560
we are actually designing a like scoring

754
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,839
system for a variant where you we bring

755
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,480
in all these protein features and um

756
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,560
like see what are those features are

757
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,240
actually relevant to the pathogenicity

758
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,560
so that we can like provide like or help

759
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,599
to build a hypothesis. So okay this

760
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,079
variance is not clustered but it has

761
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,320
this this is features and it has a

762
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,880
certain like area in the protein 3D

763
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,200
structure so that it may have an impact

764
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,000
on like proteins functional side or it

765
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,920
can be from okay this is a disrupting

766
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,240
physical chemical property. So we are

767
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,520
actively working on this variant

768
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,920
interpretation tools and is about to um

769
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,320
incorporate it into the portal but if

770
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,640
you have any interest of your gene you

771
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,240
always uh you can feel free to reach out

772
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,760
to the group so that you can yeah

773
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,800
collaborate we always welcome

774
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,800
collaborations. Yeah

775
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
>> thank you but yeah we don't actually

776
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,599
give any uh scores here but you can

777
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,800
actually compare with those pathogenic

778
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,880
varants on top of your mutations.

779
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,359
Um okay where we yeah we can actually

780
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,800
export this annotations and then we can

781
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,240
actually analyze uh in the text or table

782
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,640
formats. Um here I want to actually show

783
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,960
you another thing. So the cool thing

784
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,800
from here is

785
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,880
we can actually go back to the structure

786
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,760
and then we can actually interpret this

787
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,119
one in the different context as well. um

788
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,480
let's say DNT3A actually metilate the

789
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,480
DNA right and then we can actually check

790
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,680
whether these mutations are close to the

791
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,599
DNA as well so what I want to try to

792
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,320
show you here is even if you go back to

793
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,800
this the all your steps and then click

794
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,440
on new PTB structure

795
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,400
it actually kept all the information

796
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,320
what I did and then actually you can

797
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,800
actually keep all the annotation as it

798
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,920
is but you can change the structure So

799
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,320
you can actually have another

800
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,760
interpretation by changing your

801
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,000
structure in this interactive module.

802
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,480
Um the last part here I want to show you

803
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,440
is a sharing function. So if you want to

804
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,359
keep this session active for next seven

805
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,119
days, you have to click this share

806
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:54,720
button and then you have to put your um

807
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,920
Gmail account and add it. Also, you can

808
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,320
actually share this one with your

809
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,160
collaborator by their putting your their

810
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,000
emails and create account create a link

811
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,760
and then you can just copy this link and

812
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:13,359
share it. So, if I paste in here,

813
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,520
then I can keep this session for next

814
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,520
seven days.

815
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,599
Okay, I think that's pretty much

816
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,760
everything from here. Do you have any

817
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,680
questions so far?

818
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,920
Any

819
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,760
questions?

820
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,800
Um, I have a Well, there's two

821
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,359
questions. Well, one is how do you deal

822
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,440
with or can you deal with inframe

823
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,680
deletions? So, or or Exxon skipping? Um,

824
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,680
we I work on a large autism cohort and

825
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:46,240
we're finding a lot of these types of

826
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,560
variants. Yeah, we we um in the uh

827
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,680
sequence viewer tab, you'll be able to

828
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,440
access the inframe um delions um and

829
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,520
frame shifts variants of but you can map

830
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,000
those position on the protein structure

831
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,720
but interpretation is that like since

832
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,280
that position your protein sequence is

833
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,040
going to be entirely changed. So you

834
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,359
might um have to aware of that this

835
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,440
interpretation into the onto the print

836
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,839
3D structure might not be that accurate

837
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,280
but you can um pinpoint where is the

838
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,920
mutation but like other functional

839
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,119
annotations and this PPIs and structural

840
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,920
feature might not be um biologically

841
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,680
relevant and it it should be really case

842
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,920
by case you need to look at like where

843
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,800
the sequences are going to change

844
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,000
>> by your yeah your non SMV sequence

845
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,200
mutation.

846
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,480
>> Um, another question on the channel here

847
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,320
is someone's asking about clinically um,

848
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,079
publication ready images. If you could

849
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,200
just kind of show that one more time

850
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,200
because I think that's of interest.

851
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,480
>> Oh

852
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,200
yes.

853
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,200
So,

854
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,320
so yeah, we can export this one here as

855
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,720
well. Um, there are a ton of way to

856
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,320
export the images here. Uh, I also

857
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,760
personally export this uh session. Um,

858
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,760
if you're very familiar with this more

859
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,320
star viewer. So, this is what's this is

860
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,480
called a more star viewer which RCSV

861
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,440
data bank also use it. So if you

862
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,200
actually save this session export it you

863
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,680
can keep this exact same uh view for

864
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,920
>> can I can I add to the please question.

865
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,320
So if you go back you can so folks can

866
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,040
also download the pimal script. So all

867
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,359
the mapping that is performed they can

868
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,599
download and open locally in pole

869
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,680
session and that is the best way to

870
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,480
generate a publication ready figure.

871
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,280
from the portal will be this structure

872
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,119
viewer and then you can look at the

873
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,079
screenshot over there on the screen

874
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,599
viewer that takes the screenshot of the

875
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,079
entire sequence viewer.

876
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,760
>> Gotcha.

877
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,839
>> So the sequence viewer and structure

878
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,480
viewer side by side and if you want to

879
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,480
deep dive then I what I recommend is to

880
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,839
download the pal section open it in the

881
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,720
primal end.

882
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,359
>> Cool. All right great thanks. Yeah. And

883
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,240
that primer section will have all these

884
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,000
uh features that sit out. So actually

885
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,319
have almost the same features.

886
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,880
>> Very good. Cool question.

887
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,040
>> So right now you have showed about

888
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,200
single protein and how mapping uh you

889
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,440
know variance to a single protein. Is

890
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,079
there any plan to get into protein

891
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,000
protein interaction and having interface

892
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,119
between these two proteins and mapping

893
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,160
those variants to it?

894
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,160
>> I actually put that

895
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,800
Yeah, you can bring in any PTB structure

896
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,800
if you have a complex uh protein

897
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,960
structure chain A and chain B and chain

898
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,839
is A is your interest of protein and

899
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,359
chain B is another one if you go can you

900
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,880
pull up a um PDP structure with other

901
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,000
chains

902
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,000
>> such as yeah

903
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
sure

904
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,800
Yeah, if you pull um if you load this um

905
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,400
heterdo like complex structure with DNA

906
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,960
and everything, you can see actually the

907
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,880
chain information here. So this chain K

908
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,960
and P is DN MT3A and chain N and S is

909
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,760
other protein. So you can map protein

910
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,680
and where see where those mutations are

911
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,880
located and um from this uh PPI features

912
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,599
this is the premputed ones that we

913
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,160
calculated from all available uh PTB

914
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,440
structures. So if you click it here like

915
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,560
interchain hydrogen bonds

916
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,560
and you zoom out and you can see the

917
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,319
hoverboard text here. So it says um two

918
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,000
annotation. I'm not sure if it's

919
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,520
working.

920
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,880
You can see the home of a texture

921
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:21,839
annotation which says K 299 and K 343 um

922
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:24,400
is interacting um and F303. So if even

923
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,040
if it's an between chains we annotate

924
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,119
them in this tab so that you can

925
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,079
download it actually later for the

926
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,079
analys for your analysis.

927
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,640
>> Great.

928
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,520
>> Uh so uh this is a amazing resource. Uh

929
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,599
so I saw that you have already mapped

930
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,119
all the nomad and clean bar variants

931
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,760
into this uh all the protein residual in

932
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,599
this portal but is it possible to map

933
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,839
say any arbitrary uh genomic variants uh

934
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,119
for example that's uh found in a new

935
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,079
data set and map and to the protein

936
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,520
structure here.

937
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,000
>> Yeah that's exactly what this

938
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,520
interaction

939
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,680
>> the uh mapping module does. So he

940
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,400
uploaded uh this uh base set in

941
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,040
screening data but um as long as you

942
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,880
have a right format which is HVSP like

943
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,960
formats or um the single amino acid u

944
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,400
letters uh you'll be able to map any

945
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,079
mutations. So if you go to here

946
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,640
just click any case studies any

947
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,480
structures

948
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,040
in this annotation tab you can just

949
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,760
arbitrarily say okay this is residue ID

950
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,839
column and this is your mutation and

951
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,079
like I don't know position 34 y 34k

952
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,000
something like this that will just yeah

953
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,040
take you to this mapping

954
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,680
>> from the simple

955
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,520
>> not too much about like like this uh h

956
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,400
as you're talking about genet genomic

957
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,000
coordinates.

958
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,240
>> Yeah. Is it possible to become a close

959
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,560
to say the GRCH38

960
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,200
and first do this mutation? What are the

961
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,480
recommendations?

962
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,280
>> Um in that case I I recommend for to use

963
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,640
to use the the web ensemble web tool so

964
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,960
that you can upload your genomic

965
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,880
coordinate and will give you the protein

966
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,560
consequences and we only support the

967
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,720
protein consequences at this point.

968
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,960
Yeah.

969
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,560
So yeah, this interactive module

970
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,440
supports program level mapping. Yeah.

971
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,839
>> Uh there's a question on Zoom. Um do the

972
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,319
annotations you map to the structure

973
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,480
include pro post-transational

974
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,440
modifications including recognition of

975
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,280
gly glycosol transferases ubiquinases

976
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,240
ubiquinases etc.

977
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,560
>> Yeah we have a we we are bringing postr

978
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,599
modification uh from the phosphoite plus

979
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,599
database. they uh uh collected um

980
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,240
experimentally validated and predicted

981
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,119
the possible site plus size. So as long

982
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,520
as the data is there uh in the database

983
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,720
you can bring to the portal and see in

984
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,800
the 3D space.

985
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,200
>> Cool.

986
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,200
I think we are running out of time so I

987
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,560
hand it over to Siki for the finishing.

988
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:07,040
>> Yeah. Yeah. So um we have another module

989
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,720
which you can actually feed your own

990
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,560
protein structures as well. We are

991
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,640
skipping this but feel free to watch

992
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,119
this tutorial video that we have. We

993
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,760
have a full playlist of YouTube tutorial

994
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,720
that you can follow about various

995
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:24,079
functionality of the pre- teams of the

996
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,680
portal. So go back to the slide. So I

997
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,240
know many of you work with the

998
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,720
confidential data and um worry about

999
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,560
like uploading your data to anywhere to

1000
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,119
to address this. We care about the

1001
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,400
security and confidentiality. So we bu

1002
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:42,079
we built our infrastructure so that your

1003
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,319
user uploaded data never leaves on the

1004
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,880
uh label leaves the user's local device

1005
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:49,200
and circle on the front end. So it means

1006
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,920
it never shared or stored through the

1007
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,160
backend server of the portal and your

1008
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,400
interaction mapping module requires you

1009
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,119
to the Google signin authentification.

1010
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,400
So it added another layer of security

1011
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,079
that only verified user can um upload

1012
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,240
and access the interactive mapping

1013
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,119
module.

1014
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,200
So for uh developers and anyone's

1015
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,599
interested in um incorporating this

1016
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,440
genomics portal to their um own

1017
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:20,240
pipeline, we provide uh the swagger API

1018
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,800
interface where you carry your gene and

1019
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,640
then get some of the features from the

1020
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,280
portal and we have also Python client

1021
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,920
library. So you can see this API tab for

1022
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,760
more information

1023
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,880
and another thing I want to mention is

1024
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,200
that we maintain and update the portal

1025
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,440
in a regular basis. So some of data um

1026
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,680
which is really timesensitive we

1027
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,920
dynamically load them such as the list

1028
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,400
of PDB available. So as soon as it's

1029
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,680
deposited in the PDB or alpha you'll be

1030
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,760
able to access the structure and of some

1031
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,440
of the premputed data like structural

1032
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:02,000
data or the PPI data uh we update have

1033
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:04,160
we have a major by annual update and um

1034
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,520
for the clean bar variant given that

1035
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,000
it's a rapid speed of the data

1036
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,960
submission we update the clean bar uh

1037
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,200
variants on a monthly basis. So if you

1038
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,280
go to the release log tab on to the

1039
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,760
portal, you can see all of this version

1040
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:24,880
information at a particular point and

1041
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:27,839
all of this log that we updated so far.

1042
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,400
Um today we have more than uh 10,000

1043
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:33,119
users um and researchers around the

1044
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,920
world and we this uh platform is

1045
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,599
continues to grow. We are we continue to

1046
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,920
expand our functionality to different

1047
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,760
directions and I just want to highlight

1048
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,559
a couple of direction that we are

1049
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,240
actively working on. First is as um the

1050
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,720
question that we are developing the

1051
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,000
variant scoring system from the preins

1052
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,319
3D structure to interpret this variant

1053
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,400
um by their protein level features and

1054
00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:00,000
like which feature actually attribute

1055
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,480
that I'll u have another slide for this

1056
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,520
to briefly introduce it and we are also

1057
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,040
thinking um working on this agent system

1058
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:11,040
that you can curry um from this large

1059
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,599
language models uh you know natural

1060
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,359
language basis and We have also working

1061
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,520
on this integration of the on demand

1062
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,599
tool so that you can actually run a

1063
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,800
couple of tools on the portal and

1064
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,040
analyze your datas as well.

1065
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,839
So just quickly introduce this scoring

1066
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,680
system um we have a we had a question

1067
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,319
like so which protein features are

1068
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,400
actually um enriched within the

1069
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,000
pathogenic varian affect the pathogen

1070
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,920
pathogenicity.

1071
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,400
So I it's there's no time to explain it

1072
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,960
in detail but the main idea is that we

1073
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,520
created a data set of the pathogenic and

1074
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,760
proximity 9 and with the uh feature

1075
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,480
enrichment analysis and created these

1076
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,119
types of incilico scoring systems so

1077
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,839
that you can u curry a mutations for

1078
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:03,119
example um I search the par gamma r 194

1079
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:06,000
um y w mutation it will give you a score

1080
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,000
and it'll give you the interpretation

1081
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,960
Based on the score, this is likely to be

1082
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,760
pathogenic with a certain um confidence

1083
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,680
and by the nature of the design of the

1084
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,400
score we can actually decompose the

1085
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,559
score into different direction of of the

1086
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,240
protein feature. So you can actually

1087
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,720
measure

1088
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,440
where is the score coming from is coming

1089
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,760
from biochemical property change or it's

1090
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,280
coming from the structural stability um

1091
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:37,280
aspect or functional side domains. So we

1092
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,760
hope uh this score to provide and help

1093
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,599
to build a hypothesis um and it should

1094
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,680
be uh really gene by gene approach where

1095
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,920
you have an expert knowledge and you

1096
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,040
have a score then you will be able to

1097
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,240
create a hypothesis.

1098
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,200
So um this is all about platform. You

1099
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,440
can visit our website and go to the

our through the email and as I briefly

1104
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,480
