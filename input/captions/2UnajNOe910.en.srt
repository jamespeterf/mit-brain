prepares to attend the conference he

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
takes a moment to speak with us about

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,039
the climate and infrastructure laws

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,440
enacted in the last year in the United

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,280
States and about the impact these laws

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,320
can have in the global energy

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,640
transition question as we speak you're

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,600
getting ready to go to cop 27 can you

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,159
set the

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,479
scene

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,759
answer there's a lot of interest among

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,520
vulnerable countries about compensation

31
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,000
for the impacts climate change has had

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,920
on them or loss and damage a topic that

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,640
the United States refused to address

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,280
last year at cop 26 for fear of opening

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,520
up a Floodgate and leaving us taxpayers

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,479
exposed to unlimited liability for our

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,280
past and future emissions this is a

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,759
crucial issue of fairness for developed

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,560
countries and well of acknowledging our

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,880
common Humanity but in a sense it's also

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,360
a sideshow and addressing it won't

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,759
prevent a climate catastrophe we really

43
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,719
need to focus on mitigation with the

44
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,840
passage of the bipartisan infrastructure

45
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,680
investment and jobs act in the inflation

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,520
reduction act Ira the United States is

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,039
now in a strong position to twist some

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,439
arms these laws are largely about

49
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,920
subsidizing the deployment of low carbon

50
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,479
Technologies pretty much all of them

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,320
we're going to do a lot in the United

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,560
States in the next decade that will lead

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,039
to dramatic cost reductions for these

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,040
Technologies and enable other countries

55
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,640
with fewer resources to adopt them as

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,080
well it's exactly the leadership role

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,000
the United States has needed to assume

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,599
now we have the opportunity to Rally the

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,319
rest of the world and get other

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
countries to commit to more ambitious

61
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,800
decarbonization goals and to build

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,239
practical programs that take advantage

63
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,720
of the investable pathways we going to

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,000
for public and private actors but that

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,319
alone won't get us there money is still

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,920
a huge problem especially in emerging

67
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,920
markets and developing countries and I

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,239
don't think the institutions we rely on

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
to help these countries fund

70
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,720
infrastructure energy and everything

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,440
else are adequately funded nor do these

72
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,480
institutions have the right structures

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,280
incentives and Staffing to fund low

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,239
carbon development in these countries

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,720
rapidly enough or on the necessary scale

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,879
I'm talking about the World Bank for

77
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,680
instance but the other multilateral or

78
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,599
organizations have similar issues I

79
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,239
frankly don't think the multilaterals

80
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,000
can be reformed or sufficiently

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,680
redirected on a short enough time frame

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,400
we definitely need new leadership for

83
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,400
these

84
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,040
organizations and I think we probably

85
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,560
need to quickly establish new

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,840
multilaterals with new people more money

87
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,799
and a Clarity of purpose that is likely

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,879
beyond what can be achieved

89
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,560
incrementally I don't know if this is

90
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,159
going to be an active public discussion

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,840
at cop 27 but I hope it takes place

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,519
somewhere soon give the strong role our

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,120
government plays in financing and

94
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,159
selecting the leadership of these

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,680
institutions perhaps this is another

96
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,120
opportunity for the United States to

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,120
demonstrate courage and

98
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,840
Leadership question what investable

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,640
pathways are you talking about answer

100
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,400
well the pathways we're implicitly

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,920
trying to pursue with the infrastructure

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,200
act and Ira are pretty clear and I'll

103
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,239
come back to them but first let me

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,120
describe the landscape there are three

105
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,200
main sources of demand for energy in the

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,760
economy industry meaning chemical

107
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,959
production fuel for electricity

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,079
generation cement production materials

109
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,760
and Manufacturing and so on

110
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,560
Transportation cars trucks ships planes

111
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,120
and trains and buildings for heating and

112
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,919
cooling mostly that's about it and these

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,560
three sectors account for 75% of our

114
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,960
total greenhouse gas emissions so the

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,600
pathways are all about how to

116
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,720
decarbonize these three end use sectors

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,840
there are a lot of Technologies some

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,039
some that exist some that don't that

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,680
will have to be brought to bear and so

120
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,240
it can be a little overwhelming to try

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
to imagine how it will all transpire but

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,759
it's pretty clear at a high level what

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,400
our options are first generate a lot of

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,560
low carbon electricity and Electrify as

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,400
many industrial processes vehicles and

126
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,639
building heating systems as we can

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,639
second develop and deploy at massive

128
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,840
scale technologies that can capture

129
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,919
carbon dioxide from Smoke Stacks or the

130
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,560
air and put it somewhere that it can

131
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,160
never escape from in other words carbon

132
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,680
capture and sequestration or

133
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,520
CCS third for end uses like Aviation

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
that really need to use fuels because

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,560
they're extraordinary energy density

136
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,639
develop lowcar carbon alternatives to

137
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,080
fossil fuels and fourth is Energy

138
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,919
Efficiency across the board but I don't

139
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,840
really count that as a separate pathway

140
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,960
per se so by investable Pathways I mean

141
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,280
specific ways to pursue these options

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,199
that will attract investors what the

143
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,960
infrastructure Act and the IRA do is

144
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,280
deploy carrots in the form of subsidies

145
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,759
in a variety of ways to close the gap

146
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,120
between what it costs to deploy

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,639
Technologies like CCS that aren't yet at

148
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,160
a commercial stage because they're

149
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,120
immature and what energy markets will

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,479
tolerate a similar situation occurs for

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,199
lowcar carbon production of hydrogen one

152
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,440
of the leading low carbon fuel

153
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,960
candidates we can make it by splitting

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,960
water with electricity electrolysis but

155
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,319
that costs too much with present day

156
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,880
technology or we can make it more

157
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,400
cheaply by separating it from methane

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,400
which is what natural gas mainly is but

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,160
that creates carbon dioxide that has to

160
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,720
be transported and sequestered somewhere

161
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,599
and then we have to store the hydrogen

162
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,000
until we're ready to use it and

163
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,800
transport it by pipeline to the

164
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,199
industrial facilities where it will be

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,280
used that requires infrastructure that

166
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,319
doesn't exist pipelines compression

167
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,199
stations big tanks come to think of it

168
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,960
the demand for all that hydrogen doesn't

169
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,880
exist either at least not if industry

170
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,960
has to pay what it actually costs so one

171
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,840
very important thing these new acts do

172
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,520
is subsidize production of hydrogen in

173
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,479
various ways and subsidize the creation

174
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,560
of a CCS industry the other thing they

175
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:48,520
do is subsidize the deployment at

176
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,599
enormous scale of lowcar carbon Energy

177
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,120
Technologies some of them are already

178
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,720
pretty cheap like solar and wind but

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,680
they need to be supported by a lot of

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,759
storage on the grid which we don't yet

181
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,280
have and by other sorts of grid

182
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,360
infrastructure that again don't exist so

183
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,280
they now get subsidized too along with

184
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,800
other carbon- free and low carbon

185
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,479
generation Technologies basically all of

186
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,919
them the idea is that by stimulating ATS

187
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:14,919
scale deployment of all these

188
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,240
established and emerging Technologies

189
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,560
and funding demonstrations of Novel

190
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,919
infrastructure effectively lowering the

191
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,000
cost of supply of low carbon energy in

192
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,680
the form of electricity and fuels we

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,400
will draw out the private sector to

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,840
build out much more of the connective

195
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,280
infrastructure and invest in New indust

196
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,479
processes new home heating systems and

197
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,599
low carbon

198
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,479
Transportation this subsidized buildout

199
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,160
will take place over a decade and then

200
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,240
phase out as cost fall hopefully leaving

201
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,639
the foundation for a thriving low carbon

202
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,479
energy economy in its wake along with

203
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,159
crucial Technologies and knowledge that

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,080
will benefit the whole

205
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,840
world question is all of the federal

206
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,840
investment in energy infrastructure in

207
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,240
the United States relevant to the energy

208
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,520
crisis in Europe right now answer not in

209
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,000
a direct way Europe is a near-term

210
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,759
catastrophe with a long-term challenge

211
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,720
that is in many ways more difficult than

212
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,120
ours because Europe doesn't have the

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,680
level of primary energy resources like

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,039
oil and gas that we have in abundance

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,680
energy costs more in Europe especially

216
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,520
absent Russian pipelines in a way the

217
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,280
narrowing of Europe's options creates an

218
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,000
impetus to invest in low carbon

219
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,000
Technologies sooner than otherwise the

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,159
result either way will be expensive

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,199
energy and quite a lot of economic

222
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,360
suffering for years the near-term

223
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,919
challenge all is to protect people from

224
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
high energy prices the big spikes in

225
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,479
electricity prices we see now are driven

226
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,360
by the natural gas market disruption

227
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
which will eventually dissipate as new

228
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,720
sources of electricity come online

229
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,120
Sweden for example just announced a plan

230
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,680
to develop new nuclear and we're seeing

231
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,200
other countries like Germany soften

232
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,480
their stance on nuclear and gas markets

233
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
will sort themselves out meanwhile

234
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,839
governments are trying to Shield their

235
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,760
people with electricity price gaps and

236
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,120
other subsidies but that's enormously

237
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,519
burdensome

238
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,640
the EU recently announced gas price caps

239
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,920
for imported gas to try to eliminate

240
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,200
price gouging by importers and reduce

241
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,399
the subsidy burden that may help to

242
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
lower Downstream prices or it may make

243
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,279
matters worse by reducing the flow of

244
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,680
gas into the EU and fueling scarcity

245
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,120
pricing and ultimately adding to the

246
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,560
subsidy burden a lot of people are quite

247
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,600
reasonably suggesting that if

248
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,920
electricity prices are subject to crazy

249
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,079
behavior in gas markets then why not

250
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,480
disconnect from the grid and

251
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,839
self-generate when that also help reduce

252
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,839
demand for gas overall and also reduce

253
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,560
carbon dioxide emissions it would but

254
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,040
it's expensive to put solar panels on

255
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,959
your roof and batteries in your basement

256
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,920
so for those Rich enough to do this it

257
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,800
would lead to higher average electricity

258
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,160
costs that would live on far into the

259
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,600
future even when grid prices eventually

260
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,320
come down so an interesting idea is

261
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,240
taking hold with considerable

262
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,320
encouragement from National governments

263
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,360
the idea of energy communities basically

264
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,320
towns or cities that encourage local

265
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,120
firms and homeowners to install solar

266
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,560
and batteries and make some sort of

267
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
business arrangement with the local

268
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,440
utility to allow the community to

269
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,079
disconnect from the National Grid at

270
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,480
times of high prices and self-supply in

271
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:16,360
other words use the utility's wires to

272
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,440
sell locally generated power locally

273
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,040
it's interesting to think about it takes

274
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,880
less battery storage to handle the

275
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,200
intermittency of solar when you have a

276
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,720
lot of generators and consumers so

277
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,279
forming a community helps lower costs

278
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,279
and with a good deal from the utility

279
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,880
for using their wires it might not be

280
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,399
that much more expensive and of course

281
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,440
when the National Grid is working well

282
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,920
and prices are normal the community

283
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,800
would reconnect and buy Power cheaply

284
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,079
while selling back its self-generated

285
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,000
power to the grid there are also

286
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:46,320
potentially important social benefits

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,440
that might acre in these energy

288
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
communities too it's not a dumb idea and

289
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,120
we'll see some interesting

290
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,639
experimentation in this area in the

291
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,639
coming years as usual the Germans are

292
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,639
enthusiastic
