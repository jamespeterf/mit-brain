1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,320
And now we will start with Chris Mahi

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,800
Argetta, research scientist at the MIT

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,120
center for transportation and logistics.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,199
Uh Chris is also director of the MIT

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
supply chain and global logistic

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,080
excellence logistics excellence network

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,680
or scale and his presentations survive

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,119
or thrive the future of supply chains in

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,160
a volatile world. So Chris please go

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,399
ahead.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,719
Oh, thank you very much, Jose, for the

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,680
the kind presentation. So, it's a it's a

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,440
a big pleasure to be with you guys. So,

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,520
um and thanks again for the invitation

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,160
to the ILP, you know, like for the

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,280
invitation to to this very interesting

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,120
uh event that you put together. So, uh

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,800
now let's get started. So, there are a

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,399
lot of things happening right now in the

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,160
world and naturally you are very

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,239
overwhelmed by many of the changes that

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
are happening right now. So let's start

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
you know like deep diving a little bit

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,359
more on what is happening outside there

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,760
and why is happening and how you can

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,600
prepare yourselves. But before I move on

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,360
into these details first I would like to

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,240
speak a little bit more about what we do

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
at the emerging market economy logistics

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,479
lab that is the laboratory that I

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
represent. Basically uh the slogan that

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,640
we use is that we aim to connect the

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,600
global south hemisphere to the global

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,759
north hemisphere because most of the raw

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,080
materials and the resources that are

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,080
outside there that the mother nature has

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,880
provide are located in the global south

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,640
hemisphere but this includes not only

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,200
food as you can see in the first stream

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,600
that is regarding agri food access

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,079
models but also regarding other type of

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,240
commodities including mining including

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,079
energy oil etc etc etc. So we aim

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,920
actually to connect all of those by

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,240
providing value added services around

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
the world and making sure that we are

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
making a difference for the ones who

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,759
need the most as well. So having said

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,000
that the four streams that you see here

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,240
including agri food access models

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560
including upstream supply chains

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,960
including global and uh transportation

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,920
and um crossber transportation and

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,760
finally what is recently called

55
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,760
logistics public policy making is

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,200
something that we are trying to use in

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,920
order to make what we call um ev

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,000
evidence-based and applied research

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
perspectives by using a bunch of

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
different techniques. But now let's deep

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,200
dive a little bit more on what is

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,000
important here. So when we speak about

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,400
supply chains there are like seven core

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,720
capacities that we need to bear in mind.

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
The first one is acquire materials you

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,400
know all the procurement that allows to

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
maintain the supply across the supply

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,319
chain. Second shipping and transporting

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,640
all of those materials wherever they

70
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,319
are. Third manufacturing them converting

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,959
them into something that is going to be

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,720
useful for human beings. Uh the fourth

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,959
one is actually to distribute them to

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,760
final consumers right but there are

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,519
other three important uh characteristics

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,080
that we need to keep in mind and these

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,480
capacities are include communication

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,280
because also the supply chains manage

79
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,360
something that we call information flows

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,120
we need to consider the human talent we

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
are focusing too much these days on

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,360
datadriven perspectives AI machine

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
learning but at the end the humans are

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
the ones making the decision and I'm

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
going to speak a little bit more about

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,360
it in a moment And last but not least,

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
we also have financial flows without the

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,599
money well and the cash. The cash is

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,680
king. We need to keep it moving across

90
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,480
the supply chain. So these seven

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,720
capacities are can be also considered

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,280
that they create some types of

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,959
uncertainty. If we consider acquiring

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,799
materials, if you don't have enough

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
suppliers, this will create some kind of

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
a disruption. In the second one, if you

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,799
don't have enough drivers, this can

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,959
create also a crisis. The same that if

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
you don't have enough containers. The

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,400
third one with manufacturing if you

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,720
don't have you know like the proper

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
workforce or the right number it would

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,720
be extremely difficult for you to do

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,200
everything that you do and speaking of

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,519
nearshoring French shoring offshoring

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,120
etc. So it's everything related to that

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
right where should where you should

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,879
locate all your different facilities and

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,560
distribution to to customers well is

110
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,120
what is happening right now is all the

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,079
pressure coming from panic buying you

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,840
know like shutdowns that had have been

113
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,919
happening here and there so and I can

114
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,759
continue putting many different examples

115
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,759
but for the sake of time I would like to

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,400
actually mention why I'm putting this in

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,479
front of you because most of the times

118
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,720
we are not making this simple exercise

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,720
that is capac capacity assessment. Most

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
of the times we tend to forget that we

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
need to analyze these capacities,

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,600
understand the utilization that we have

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,759
about that specific capacity, the cost

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,720
that it will take me in case that I want

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,639
to expand or stretch this capacity or

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,759
how much capital should I invest in

127
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
order to make that happen. And as I you

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
I always prefer to say like okay and

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,320
what is happening regarding how long

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,880
this is going to take you know or delay

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,600
in order to get this. So and how we can

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,000
face this uncertainty there is something

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,759
that we call mitigation mitigation

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
strategies and basically it's to reduce

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,479
the likelihood of something bad to

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,560
happen. So everything outside there the

137
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,800
strategies you might develop in terms of

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,720
diversifying your suppliers or making

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,639
sure that you are connecting you know

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,199
like to the right partners reliable

141
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,280
partners is a mitigation strategy. But

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
we also have something else that we call

143
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,919
resilience actions. The resilience

144
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,680
action basically aims to avoid on these

145
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,880
side effects of all of these potential

146
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,600
disruptions. But not most of the times

147
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
we are too focused on the direct effects

148
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
that the that these disruptions might

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,400
have without necessarily paying

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,520
attention to what are the indirect

151
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,639
effects if there is a a fire in a

152
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,240
particular factory or a flood. So it's

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,639
very clear that we're going to stop the

154
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,320
production. But what is going to happen

155
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,320
downstream in the supply chain or

156
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,759
upstream in the supply chain we need to

157
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,400
start paying attention to these

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,880
particular issues. So and in order to

159
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
understand I kind of slice down a little

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,960
bit like the uncertainty types we need

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,280
to bear in mind economic risk,

162
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
geopolitical risk, the technological

163
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,520
risk and of course we need to start

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,840
paying more and more attention to where

165
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,400
are all of these resources that we need

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,680
for our supply chains to for our

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,680
products located. Are they global

168
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,240
globally concentrated in a specific

169
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,560
region country? Are they located in a

170
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
specific industry or being used by a

171
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
specific industry? We need to start

172
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,919
paying attention to that. And in my

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,759
experience working with companies,

174
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,680
sometimes we pay attention to tier one

175
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
or tier two suppliers when actually the

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,479
problems happen h are happening like in

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
the tier four and five suppliers. So

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,240
that's something that you need to bear

179
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
in mind. So now let's talk about

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,880
something that fascinates me a lot and

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
is the human behavior. So I typically

182
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,800
provide this experiment to my students

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,479
and we typically what we do here let me

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,639
explain the experiment to you and then I

185
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,560
will explain the graphs that you have in

186
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,880
front of you. We tell the students to

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,840
define the best order size to produce a

188
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,440
perishable product for each of the days

189
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,120
across these 25 21 days. Right? So they

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
need to dispose the product at the end

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
of the day. So this means that they

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,960
cannot hold inventory. Right? And the

193
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,960
demand as you can imagine is random.

194
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,800
It's uncertain like in the real life

195
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,960
demand. But at the end this is a

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,840
simplification of the reality. So what

197
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,759
you can see here actually is with this

198
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,560
simple experiment we have observed

199
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,560
different pattern. So at the top graph

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,880
you can see the best performer and in

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
the bottom chart you can see the poorest

202
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,000
performer of that particular cohort that

203
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,560
we have. So we have a several elements

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,880
here. What you see here in this um

205
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
orange line is actually the demand that

206
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,360
was observed and as you can see it's the

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,360
same demand for both individuals. Right?

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,440
However, the way that they actually

209
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,879
approach the ordering behavior is

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,479
completely different. The ordering

211
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,039
behavior is the one that you see in

212
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,039
green here. So this is the near to

213
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,360
optimal behavior that is actually

214
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,440
presented with this straight line here.

215
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,319
And as you can see this individual is

216
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,000
trying to very to be very close to the

217
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,240
optimal you know like order here. But

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,160
the other one on the contrary again is

219
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,479
the green line compared to the optimal

220
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,479
that is this plain line or a straight

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,400
line. You see a lot of oscillation

222
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,240
right. And of course if you want to pay

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,800
attention to the profit that is like how

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
much this person was earning at the end

225
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,800
of each of the days. So naturally the

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,560
one that was not oscillating much was

227
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,640
the one who was like the best approach

228
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,320
possible right because that person is

229
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,640
not going to be paying too much money.

230
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,360
So what is happening here? Why why this

231
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,640
is important for us? All our well all

232
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:51,040
our behavior is dictated by something

233
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,680
very simple. Are we risk averse or risk

234
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,959
prone? And if you answer this very

235
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,560
simple question actually you will

236
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,160
realize that most of us we are risk

237
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,640
averse particularly when there is

238
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,640
something bad happening outside there.

239
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
So we need to make like logical

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
decisions and understand like what is

241
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,000
happening outside there. But this might

242
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,760
bring us you know like many different

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,760
trade-offs and then we will start paying

244
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,800
attention to many other things like loss

245
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,040
sales compared to waste comparing the

246
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,959
lead time versus the shelf life of the

247
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
product and then this can create like

248
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,880
forecasting issues or also inventory

249
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,600
issues. you might be ordering more than

250
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,760
what you need and then this can create

251
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,160
an unnecessary effect at the end that is

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,160
going to create issues in the whole

253
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,560
supply chain because the the supply

254
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,399
chains still depend on us and they will

255
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,640
keep depending on us. We are the ones

256
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,560
making the decisions and humans

257
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,080
unfortunately tend to overreact to past

258
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,240
realizations. We tend to consider or

259
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,480
follow close to the average let's say

260
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
behavior making these decisions when

261
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
actually we need to pay a little bit

262
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,480
more attention to what is happening to

263
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,279
the uncertainty but we typically don't

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,839
go with the whole visibility of to the

265
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,519
up to the the consumer side. So that's

266
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,800
why it's important to have a little bit

267
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,640
of visibility. So now if we extrapolate

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
these concepts and this human behavior

269
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,959
to a framework that has been known for a

270
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,680
long period of time that is the AAA

271
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,040
capabilities and what is the AAA

272
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,240
capabilities is agility that you are

273
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,839
able to reconfigure the system

274
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,519
quickly

275
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,519
adaptability means that you can make

276
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,920
long-term you know like changes in the

277
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,600
system and also you know like make sure

278
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,120
to adapt to changes in the long term and

279
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
alignment means that you are able to

280
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
collaborate with others and to keep an

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,839
eye on on on your suppliers on your

282
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,920
consumers or your customers etc. But

283
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,600
this is not only a race against the

284
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,399
clock. It's also actually to pay

285
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,320
attention to the fact that we are making

286
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
right decisions properly in the right

287
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,240
time. So most of the supply chains

288
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,079
according to what we have found for with

289
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,480
some of of our studies 85% of them have

290
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,800
adoption rates in agility. So they are

291
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,760
agile supply chains. adaptable supply

292
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,320
chains are only 35% of them and less

293
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,959
than 10% are aligned supply chains. So

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,560
what we call efficient supply chains or

295
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,480
resilient supply chains there are not

296
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
too many and we need to align these

297
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,720
three different capabilities. So for the

298
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,440
sake of times I decided to bring like a

299
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,959
one specific example that we created in

300
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,360
order to connect you know like the food

301
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,200
supply chains from Latin America to the

302
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,240
US you know in order to understand the

303
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
criticality of the ports. So we did that

304
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,000
in order to understand what was going to

305
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
be the impact of the near sharing right

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
with all of the efforts that you can see

307
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,880
here and the figures that we knew that

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,959
were growing with almost 11% of

309
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,360
component annual growth rate that was

310
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,839
expected to happen between 21 and this

311
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,560
year. So the opportunities for near

312
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
shuring are great right but now with all

313
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,760
of what is happening executive orders

314
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,839
and etc. So this has the accelerated and

315
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,279
it has it has created a little bit more

316
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
uncertainty with the tariffs than

317
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,279
anything else. Right? But then what we

318
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,920
aim to develop with this research was

319
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,240
actually to understand what were the

320
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,440
most critical ports connecting Latin

321
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,200
American products to the US particularly

322
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,600
agri food related products as I will

323
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,760
mention in a moment. How does this

324
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,519
logistics infrastructure dependency

325
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,639
affect the port adaptability and agility

326
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,320
in case of any disruption happens? And

327
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,880
last but not least, we also want to

328
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,279
understand how resilient is the current,

329
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,120
you know, like port ecosystem that we

330
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,160
have in the United States for food

331
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,200
imports. And then we decided to focus on

332
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,120
seven items that are considered from the

333
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
American food basket. Uh we are

334
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,480
referring to chill products and dry

335
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,440
products. The chilled products we

336
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,360
consider banana, poultry and tomatoes. I

337
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,399
know that the American diet is way more

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,160
than than that but we simplify it. And

339
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,360
then in the dry products we consider

340
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,279
cocoa, rice, corn and potatoes. Okay,

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,279
they don't need chilled nature, right?

342
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:03,040
So we can move on. Um so this represents

343
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,000
only almost 5% of the total US food

344
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,920
imports. But guess what? This represents

345
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
almost 70% of the imported food from

346
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
Latin America and the Caribbean. It's a

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,079
lot, right? Just these seven products

348
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,720
and that's why we decided to focus on

349
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,200
them. So what we did here basically is

350
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,360
we followed these fivestep methodology

351
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
to understand well first what type of

352
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,959
data was available there to understand

353
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,120
the criticality of the different

354
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,000
logistics facilities particularly the

355
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,560
ports simulate a few potential scenarios

356
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,560
of disruption and analyze the results.

357
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,320
So fortunately we were able to to

358
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,480
collaborate with import genius that

359
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,720
tracks shipping activity around the

360
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,079
world. We also got information from the

361
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,639
US census and we were able to get AIS

362
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,480
that is automate automatic

363
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,959
identification system is imagine like

364
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
the GPS for the vessels right and based

365
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,880
on all of this information coming from

366
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,720
the USDA some interviews that we did

367
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,600
with different uh ports and different

368
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,320
people through webinars etc we were able

369
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,519
to capture around 2.3 billion rows of

370
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,240
data that but out of these 2.3 trillion

371
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,560
bill sorry billion

372
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,320
rows of data. We were able to use only

373
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,399
these 38 let me round it up million rows

374
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,720
of data. So based on that we started

375
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,120
exploring some of the analytics behind

376
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,959
them to understand what were the ports

377
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
that were more important for what type

378
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,519
of products the trends etc. That's the

379
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,839
second step. And in the third step, we

380
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,680
started understanding what were like

381
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,920
what was the criticality of the ports,

382
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,519
how vulnerable they were in case that

383
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
they were not fully connected to the

384
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,000
rest of the supply chain. And we perform

385
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,480
some simulations as I as I mentioned to

386
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,440
you before. So in the second step we

387
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,320
were able with the help of my students

388
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,800
Mateo and Santiago uh and my colleague

389
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,440
Elena Dugongji to get these very fancy

390
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,079
and very you know like informative

391
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,920
charts to understand which ports were

392
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,440
the most important ones in the United

393
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
States. As you can see, Wilmington,

394
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,480
Delaware, uh that we discovered that is

395
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,880
like a paradise for tropical fruits in

396
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
the United States was massive in terms

397
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,800
in terms of total weight more or less

398
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,560
like 25% of the whole cargo for the uh

399
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,920
seven products that I mentioned before.

400
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,920
And as you can see, the weight in

401
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,360
general terms has been growing, right?

402
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,720
And we got information until 2022. So

403
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,279
now regarding the AIS or the GPS for the

404
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,440
vessels information, we got all of the

405
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,079
potential maritime routes and we were

406
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,760
able to see what was the origin, the

407
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,360
destination and the movement around

408
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,360
these different components in the

409
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,600
vessel. So I'm not going to speak about

410
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,320
the math but what we did in the third uh

411
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,079
you know like a step was actually to

412
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:52,160
understand how well connected the the

413
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,639
the particular port was how critical was

414
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,519
this particular port to connect to other

415
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,680
facilities ports or routes and how close

416
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,360
was to other ports in order to make sure

417
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,839
to reply as soon as possible if

418
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,000
something happened. So if you actually

419
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,240
pay attention to this chart, you will

420
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
realize that Philadelphia is one of the

421
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,639
best ports in terms of connectivity is

422
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,199
the best one, right? So because it's

423
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,600
well connected in terms of closeness is

424
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,240
also the best connected and in between

425
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,399
is that is like how critical it is you

426
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,480
know like to connect to other ports is

427
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,880
also well connected. So that's why it

428
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,199
was and is the the second ranket in

429
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,360
terms of total weight. But what happened

430
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,560
to Wilmington, Delaware, the paradise of

431
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,839
tropical fruits and vegetables. So um so

432
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,399
it's 25% but look at this is not so well

433
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,639
connected right it has issues regarding

434
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,720
how close it is to other ports to the

435
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,959
compatibility issues with other ports.

436
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,959
And that's how we started analyzing that

437
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,040
there was something happening there. So

438
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,440
we started paying attention to how we

439
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,759
can change that and we started inserting

440
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,000
some potential algorithms to understand

441
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,320
what was the potential issue. So we

442
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,079
brought some of these, you know, AI

443
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,480
applied methods in order to understand

444
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,079
how mature or how the ripening process

445
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
for the bananas was going to happen in

446
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,000
order to make sure that the bananas were

447
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,439
going to arrive on time to the different

448
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
ports. And then something that we

449
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,520
analyze is that particularly the time

450
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,600
and the temperature were critical to

451
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,919
predict the the the grade of the banana

452
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,439
at the very end. So something that we

453
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,199
discovered as well and let me come back

454
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,760
here for a moment is like the thickest

455
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,440
lines are very meaningful to connect the

456
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,960
different ports. Of course you cannot

457
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,720
see like all the connections here

458
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,840
between Latin America and and and and

459
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,360
the US but the northeast particularly is

460
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,559
very important for these connections.

461
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,240
Here we have ports like Wilmington,

462
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,960
Norfolk, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New

463
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,000
Jersey etc etc. And in the south part of

464
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,320
the east component we have Charleston in

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,240
South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, etc.

466
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,360
And I can continue. Why is this

467
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,039
important? Why is this so uh relevant?

468
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,440
Because imagine the following. If we

469
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,240
simulate a disruption actually impeding

470
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,840
the cargo to get up to Wilmington, this

471
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,760
is going to create a lot of issues,

472
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,840
right? So we want to make sure to

473
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,160
understand what was like the best port

474
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,000
to deviate all the cargo. And we found

475
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
that Philadelphia was the best port to

476
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,559
debate the cargo. We created this

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,400
artificial disruption followed by New

478
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,720
York. But here is where it comes like

479
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,720
the interesting part. Why these vessels

480
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,160
are going to New York? It's not only

481
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,160
because of the capacity, it's also

482
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,400
because of the compatibility, the

483
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,720
equipment and the size of the vessels.

484
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,960
So this actually means that we needed to

485
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,280
uh to take care of how much or how

486
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,360
compatible this could be moved into into

487
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,240
different locations and to understand

488
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,559
how to create port ecosystems. So in

489
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,640
order to to go to the to the to the

490
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,280
final line before I give you like the

491
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,080
final conclusions. So we found from this

492
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,760
particular application that the refer

493
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,240
that is like the way that you connect

494
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,799
the re the refrigerated containers into

495
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,520
the into the ports was a critical

496
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,240
infrastructure. So this actually require

497
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,080
a lot of capital investment and you need

498
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,160
to create a lot of you know like model

499
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,400
and datadriven culture in your people

500
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,720
and a lot of scenario planning to make a

501
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,600
strategic decisions and this connects to

502
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,160
the adaptability

503
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,840
erh competency. The second one that we

504
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,600
found is like several ports should be

505
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,679
always considering you know like

506
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,760
alternative destination in case that the

507
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,280
first port that you're arriving fails

508
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,840
and then you need to divert these

509
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,160
vessels to other ports. So this also

510
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,559
make us think and double check that the

511
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,120
standardization on potential contingency

512
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,480
plans was good and to synchronize

513
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,559
processes to make sure that the

514
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,640
availability of those refer plugs or the

515
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,039
equipment was available as soon as

516
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,280
possible you know and this is regarding

517
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,919
agility. And the last that is the most

518
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,480
difficult one to get is like to create

519
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,720
alignment and this is actually to create

520
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,200
alternative destination ports with

521
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,280
minimum viable capacity to you know like

522
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,440
be able to serve efficiently the

523
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,600
different vessels and this implies good

524
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,440
communication in terms of capacities

525
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,039
good collaboration with other ports and

526
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,039
you know like the potential development.

527
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,960
So wrapping up here, there are many

528
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,360
conclusions, but it's I'm sad to tell

529
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,679
you that there is no one-sizefits-all

530
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,240
strategy to define this AAA capabilities

531
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,480
or actually ways to solve this, but I

532
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,480
invite you to keep an eye on the market

533
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,039
to protect your customers, to rely on

534
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,799
the data, to choose wisely your alleys,

535
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,480
particularly you know, like countries.

536
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,400
We tend to think about the supply chain

537
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,640
as potential alleys as as companies, but

538
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,559
it's also partner partner, you know,

539
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,720
like countries at the moment, you know.

540
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,240
So uh pay attention also to how the

541
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,000
supply and the demand are working

542
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,919
together in the supply side. Pay

543
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,919
attention to the procurement to the

544
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,919
sourcing supply chain network evolution.

545
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,480
Don't not only pay attention to the

546
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,360
snapshot that you take day by day. Water

547
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,440
is becoming an important part of the re

548
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,600
the the the resource shortage. So pay

549
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,080
attention to it. Geopolitical tensions

550
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,799
as I mentioned before demand you need to

551
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,520
start developing signaling related

552
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,919
stuff. E2 toe or end to end call supply

553
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,679
chains and portfolio complexity you need

554
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,840
to reduce it try to think how to

555
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,240
standardize your products and then last

556
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,760
thing call to action if you're

557
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,919
interested in knowing more how to be

558
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,360
part of research related to and direct

559
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,320
effects of disruptions on their

560
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,360
different scenarios or actually to the

561
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,679
impact of perishability uh or human

562
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,360
behavior in the supply chains or

563
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,679
actually something more exciting that is

564
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,400
how to combat food malnutrition and food

565
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,480
waste you can reach out to me. So, uh,

566
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,559
Jose, I'm going to stop here. So,

567
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,960
probably we have time for for one or two

568
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,760
questions probably. Yeah. One quick

569
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,440
question. I think, uh, is is is there

570
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,080
similar analysis? I know CTL of course

571
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,600
is extremely uh uh active and and

572
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,679
comprehensive. Are similar analyses done

573
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,320
for the um uh semiconductor supply

574
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,320
chain?

575
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,039
Yeah, there is. So naturally in the case

576
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,440
of the semiconductors and the chips um

577
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,919
there is only a couple of let's say big

578
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,240
big companies that one might think about

579
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:16,320
right so but this AAA uh framework can

580
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,039
be used elsewhere and uh to answer the

581
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,640
question how you can optimally use this

582
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,480
probably in terms of agility there is

583
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,120
not so much to be done but in terms of

584
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,720
adaptability and designing the whole

585
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,200
supply chain in the semiconductor

586
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,799
industry there is a huge opportunity

587
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,840
Right. But given that um Taiwan tends to

588
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,159
kind of centralize all the efforts,

589
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,799
probably the question should be more on

590
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
know how to optimally apply but how to

591
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,039
create you know like an alternative

592
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,840
supply chain for semiconductors and

593
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,880
understand which countries are actually

594
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,880
uh having or concentrating most of the

595
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,440
elements that you need to create a chip

596
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,960
you know or a semiconductor. uh and that

597
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,039
way you will be able actually to create

598
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,520
like the rest of the manufacturing, the

599
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,919
rest of the transportation and the seven

600
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,000
core capacities that I mentioned before.

601
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,440
Okay, great. Well, yeah, there's we

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
could we could be here another another

603
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,240
half hour easily, but um thank you so

604
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,400
much. And for anybody interested, of

605
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,000
course, uh you can also look up the

606
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Center for Trans Transportation

607
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,960
Logistics at MIT. Plenty of research

608
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,760
there. And thank you, Chris. Uh we will

609
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,760
continue on.
