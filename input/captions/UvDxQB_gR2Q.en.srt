out electrons only when the sun shines

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,800

Energy Systems our study's essential

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,239
takeaway is that hydrogen fired power

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,879
generation can be the more economical

64
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,360
option when compared to lithium ion

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,239
batteries even today when the cost of

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,879
hydrogen production transmission and

67
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,440

research assistant for Mighty adds

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,159
genser if there is a place for hydrogen

71
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,040
in the cases we analyzed that suggests

72
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,159
there is a promising role for hydrogen

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,120
to play in the energy

74
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,319
transition adding up the costs

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,200
California serves as a stellar Paradigm

76
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,080
for a swiftly shifting power system the

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,480
state draws more than 20% of its

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,680
electricity from solar and approximately

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,120
7% from wind with more VRE coming online

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
rapidly this means that peer plants

81
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,840
already play a pivotal role coming

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
online each evening when the Sun goes

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
down or when events such as heat waves

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,120
drive up electricity used for days at a

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,640
time we looked at all the peer plants in

86
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,480
California recount skener we wanted to

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,040
know the cost of electricity if we

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,040
replace them with hydrogen fired

89
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,879
turbines or lithium ion batteries the

90
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,959
researchers used a core metric called

91
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,480
the levelized cost of electricity or

92
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,879
lcoe as a way of comparing ing the cost

93
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,599
of different Technologies to each other

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,480
lcoe measures the average total cost of

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,239
building and operating a particular

96
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,439
energy generating asset per unit of

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,319
total electricity generated over the

98
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,840
hypothetical lifetime of that asset

99
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,680
selecting 2019 as their base study year

100
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,120
the team looked at their cost of running

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,640
natural gas fired peer plants which they

102
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,640
defined as plants operating 15% of the

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,319
year in response to gaps in intermittent

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,159
renewable electricity in addition they

105
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,400
determined the amount of carbon dioxide

106
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,959
released by these plants and the expense

107
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,599
of abating these emissions much of this

108
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,599
information was publicly available

109
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,560
coming up with prices for replacing peer

110
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,239
plants with massive arrays of lithium

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,359
ion batteries was also relatively

112
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,320
straightforward there are no technical

113
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,400
limitations to lithium ion so you can

114
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,080
build as many as you want but they are

115
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,880
super expensive in terms of their

116
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,880
footprint for energy storage and the

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
mining required to manufacture them says

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,720
genser but then came the hard part

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,199
nailing down the cost of hydrogen fired

120
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,639
electricity generation the most

121
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,680
difficult thing is finding cost

122
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,680
assumptions for new technologies says

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,880
hernandes you can't do this through a

124
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,160
literature review so we had many

125
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,880
conversations with equipment

126
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,600
manufacturers and plant operators the

127
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,360
team considered two different forms of

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,320
hydrogen fuel to replace natural gas one

129
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,960
produced through electrolyzer facilities

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,240
that convert water and electricity to

131
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,800
hydrogen and another that reforms

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,120
natural gas yielding hydrogen and carbon

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,520
waste that can be captured to reduce

134
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,800
emissions they also ran the numbers on

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,039
retrofitting natural gas plants to burn

136
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,639
hydrogen as opposed to building entirely

137
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,720
new facilities their Model includes

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,759
identification of likely locations

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
throughout the state and expenses

140
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,440
involved in construction of these

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,600
facilities the researchers spent months

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,520
compiling a giant data set before

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,720
setting out on the task of analysis the

144
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,800
results from their modeling were clear

145
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,400
hydrogen can be a more costeffective

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,520
alternative to ion batteries for peing

147
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,560
operations on a power grid says

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,280
Hernandez in addition notes genser while

149
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,360
certain Technologies worked better in

150
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,720
particular locations we found that on

151
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,919
average reforming hydrogen rather than

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,080
electrolytic hydrogen turned out to be

153
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,960
the cheapest option for replacing peer

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,479
plants a tool for energy

155
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,600
investors when he began this project

156
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,960
genser admits he wasn't hopeful about

157
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,440
hydrogen replacing natural gas in peer

158
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,199
plants it was kind of shocking to see in

159
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,400
our different scenarios that there was a

160
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,160
place for hydrogen that's because the

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,120
overall price tag for converting a

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,759
fossil fuel-based plant to one based on

163
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,880
hydrogen is very high and such

164
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,720
conversations likely won't take place

165
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,080
until more sectors of the economy

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,840
Embrace hydrogen whether as a fuel for

167
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,199
transportation or for varied

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,960
manufacturing and Industrial

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,639
purposes a nent hydrogen production

170
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,160
infrastructure does exist mainly in the

171
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,400
production of ammonia for fertilizer but

172
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,120
in Norm investments will be necessary to

173
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,680
expand this framework to meet grid scale

174
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
needs driven by purposeful

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,599
incentives with any of the climate

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,400
Solutions proposed today we will need a

177
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,160
carbon tax or carbon pricing otherwise

178
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,680
nobody will shift to new technologies

179
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,440
says genser the researchers believe

180
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,479
studies like theirs could help Key

181
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,880
Energy stakeholders make better informed

182
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,680

gas powered plant with one powered by

194
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,720
hydrogen as utilities industry and

Achieve zero emissions targets they have

204
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,000
become increasingly cost competitive as

Gensler knows that hydrogen alone will

209
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,199
not usher in a zeroc carbon future but

210
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,879
he says our research shows we need to

211
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,080
seriously consider hydrogen and the

used and start making the massive
