00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,919
what does my t-shirt

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,400
say that's what I like enthusiasm right

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,599
this is solid carbon dioxide dry ice its

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,799
temperature is -78° C it's very cold and

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,039
I'm going to dump the hot water in here

6
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:19,520
the hot water vapor hits the cold air it

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,160
condenses and then gets to the same

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,000
temperature it it disappears right what

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,560
I'm going to do now is Take the bucket

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,560
of dry ice put the dry ice right in

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,560
there

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,559
I can't even see

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
it condensed water vapor is what we see

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,440
we see the fog is

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,000
moving downward why because the

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,360
condensation is taking place on the

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,520
carbon dioxide gas which is denser than

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:52,480
air right for more MIT moments from MIT
