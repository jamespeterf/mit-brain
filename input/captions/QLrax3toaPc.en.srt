biomass generates 10% of the primary

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,439
energy used worldwide and the process is

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,280
used largely in rural energy poor

41
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,360
communities we're not going to change

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,040

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,079
takach Char's technology provides is a

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,439
way to use biomass more cleanly and

46
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,280
efficiently by concentrating the fuel

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,799
and eliminating contaminants such as

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,280
moisture and dirt thus creating a clean

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,159
burning fuel one that generates less

50
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,440
smoke in rural communities where biomass

51
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,680
is used extensively as a primary energy

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,040

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,120
thermochemical treatment densifies

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
biomass at elevated temperatures

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,879
converting plant materials that are

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,560
typically loose wet and bulky into

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
plants exist but collection and

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,560
transportation present major barriers to

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,680
utilization Kung says

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,040
takar solution moves processing into the

63
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,800
field to date takar has worked with

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,800
about 5,500 Farmers to process 9,000

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,599
metric tons of crops takar estimates

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,440
this technology has the potential to

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,640
reduce carbon dioxide equivalent

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,720
emissions by gigatons per year at scale

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,360
carbon dioxide equivalent is a measure

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,519
used to gauge global warming potential

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,440
in recognition in 2021 takar won the

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,280
Kenya as Kung tells the story takar

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,280
emerged from a class project that took

79
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,200
him to Kenya which explains the

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,720
company's name a combination of takataka

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,280
which means trash and Swahili and Char

82
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,519
for the charcoal end product it was 2011

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
and Kung was at MIT as a biological

84
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,159
engineering grad student focused on

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,439
cancer research but MIT gives students

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,319
big latitude for exploration and I took

87
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,920
courses outside my department he says in

88
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,040
Spring 2011 he signed up for a class

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,840
known as

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,560
15966 Global Health delivery lab in the

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,560
MIT Sloan School of

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,599
Management the class brought Kung to

93
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,200
Kenia to work with a non-governmental

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,560
organization in nairobi's kibber the

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,200
largest urban slum in Africa we

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
interviewed slum households for their

97
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,280
views on health and that's when I

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,640
noticed the charcoal problem Kung says

99
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,840
the problem as Kung describes it was

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,239
that charcoal was everywhere in cabara

101
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,319
piled up outside traded by the road and

102
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,599
used the primary fuel even indoors its

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,519
creation contributed to deforestation

104
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,239
and it smoke presented a serious health

105
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,160
hazard eager to address this challenge

106
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,000
Kung secured Fellowship support from the

107
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,759
MIT International Development initiative

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
and the Priscilla King gray Public

109
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,960
Service Center to conduct more research

110
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,919
in Kenya in 2012 he formed takar as a

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,199
team and received seed money from the

112
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,840

household organic waste this work also

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,080
led to a fertilizer company sopi

116
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,680
Organics that Kung founded in 2016 with

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,560
the help of MIT ideas but that is

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
another

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,759
story meanwhile Kong had another top

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,960
priority finding a topic for his PhD

121
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,800
dissertation back at MIT he met

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,320
Alexander slokum the Walter M May and a

123
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,639
Hazel May professor of mechanical

124
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,639
engineer in who on a long walk and talk

125
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,880
along the Charles River suggested he

126
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,880
turn his Kenya work into a thesis slum

127
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,800
connected him with Robert Stoner deputy

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,960
director for Science and Technology at

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,600
the it energy initiative Mighty and

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,320
founding director of mighty's tataa

Center for technology and design Stoner

132
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,039
in turn introduced Kung to gonum who

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,400
became his PhD adviser while slok and

134
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,520
Stoner joined his doctoral

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,560
committee roots and MIT

136
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,479
lab gon's telling of the atar Story

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,840
begins not surprisingly in the lab back

138
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,720
in 2010 he had a master student

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,520
interested in renewable energy and he

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,759
suggested the student investigate

141
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,319
biomass that student Richard Bates 10

142
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,840
sm12

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,280
phd6 began exploring the science of

144
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,759
converting biomass to more clean burning

145
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,120
charcoal through taction most taction

146
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,960
also known as low temperature paralysis

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,600
systems use external heating sources but

148
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,440
the lab's goal gum explained ples was to

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,560
develop an efficient self-sustained

150
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,840
reactor that would generate fewer

151
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,039
emissions we needed to understand the

152
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,280
chemistry and physics of the process and

153
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,720
develop fundamental scaling models

154
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,400
before going to the lab to build the

155
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,199
device he says by the time Kung joined

156
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,360
the lab in 2013 gonan was working with

157
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,280
the Tata center to identify Technologies

158
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,120
suitable for developing countries and

159
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,800
largely based on renewable energy Kung

160
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,080
was able to secure a Tata fellowship and

161
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,720
building on basis research developed the

162
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,720
small scale practical device for biomass

163
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,639
thermochemical conversion in the field

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,240
that launched tachar this device which

165
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,840
was patented by MIT with inventor Kung

166
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,080
gonium Stoner MIT research scientist

167
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,759
Santos Shambo and slokum is

168
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,960
self-contained and scalable it burns a

169
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,880
little of the biomass to generate Heat

170
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,440
this heat bakes the rest of the biomass

171
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,639
releasing gases the system then

172
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,120
introduces air to enable these gases to

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,360
combust which burns off the volatiles

174
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
and generates more heat keeping the

175
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,479
thermochemical reaction going the trick

176
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,639
is how to introduce the right amount of

177
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,360
air at the right location to sustain the

178
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,639
process gonium explains if you put in

179
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,360
more air that will burn the biomass if

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,520
you put in less there won't be enough

181
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,319
heat to produce the charcoal that will

182
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,479
stop the reaction about 10% of the

183
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,879
biomass is used as fuel to support the

184
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,039
reaction Kung says adding that 90% is

185
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,639
densified into a form that's easier to

186
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,440
handle and utilize he notes that the the

187
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,479
research received financial support from

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,800
the Abdul Latif Jam water and Food

193
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,759
up the technology at the MIT bats lab no

194
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,759
relation to Richard Bates the charcoal

195
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,479
produce is more valuable per ton and

196
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,159
easier to transport and sell than

197
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,400
biomass reducing Transportation costs by

198
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,120
2/3 and giving Farmers an additional

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,560
income opportunity

200
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,000
and an incentive not to burn

201
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,759
agricultural waste Kung says there's

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,400
more income for farmers and you get

203
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,120
better air

204
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,199
quality roots in

205
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,120
India when Kung became a Tata fellow he

206
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,800
joined a program founded to take on the

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,479
biggest challenges of the developing

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,440
world with a focus on India according to

209
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,520
Stoner Tata fellows including Kung

210
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,759
typically visit India twice a year and

211
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,720
spend 6 to8 weeks meeting stakeholders

212
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,599
in Industry the government and in

213
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,760
communities to G perspective on their

214
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,360
areas of study a unique part of Tata is

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,599
that you're considering the ecosystem as

216
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,800
a whole says Kung who interviewed

217
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,200
hundreds of small holder Farmers met

218
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,120
with truck drivers and visited existing

219
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,240
biomass processing plants during his

220
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,120
tataa trips to India along the way he

221
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,640
also connected with Indian engineer

222
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,720
videt Mohan who became takach Char's

223
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,440
co-founder it was very important for

224
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
Kevin to be there walking about

225
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,800
experimenting and interviewing Farmers

226
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,560
Stoner says he learned about the lives

227
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,640
of

228
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,519
farmers these experiences helped

229
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,200
instilling Kung an appreciation for

230
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,680
small farmers that still drives him

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,959
today as takar rolls out its first pilot

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
programs Tinkers with the technology

233
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,640
grows his team now up to 10 and

234
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Endeavors to build a revenue stream so

235
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,279
while takatar has gotten a lot of

236
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,880
attention in accolades from the idea's

237
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,600
award to the Earth shot prize Kung says

238
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,480
what motivates him is the prospect of

239
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,680
improving people's lives the dream he

240
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,440
says is to EMP power communities to help

241
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,279
both the planet and themselves we're

242
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,600
excited about the environmental justice

243
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,040
perspective he says our work brings

244
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
production and carbon removal or

245
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,240
avoidance to rural communities providing

246
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,440
them with a way to convert waste make

247
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,440
money and reduce air pollution
