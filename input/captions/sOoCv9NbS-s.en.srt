1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,839
Wonderful. Well, thank you both. I just

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,200
reflecting on on what we just heard. For

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,519
those of you who are out there in the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
world, it is almost as if we were

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,120
sitting in an office in building 62 here

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,199
at MIT listening to collaborators and

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,000
worldclass researchers on corporate

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,199
innovation brainstorm together about

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,840
what this new aspect of uh of

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,240
geopolitical driving of corporate

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,920
innovation will mean. And and we're so

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,239
fortunate to have that. And I thank you

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,399
both for your time. As you and the world

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,480
reflect on what you've just heard, as

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,960
you continue your day or start your day

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,040
or finish your day, I'm sure you will

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,640
have other questions and thoughts about

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,559
what you've heard. There are probably

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
some questions we couldn't get to.

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:54,239
Although I know Dr. Phil is a world

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,320
expert at pulling those things in. Um,

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,920
you can certainly consult Fiona and

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Phil's new book. That's a great

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
reference for a lot of this. You can

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,199
also come to us at the MIT industrial

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,000
leazison program. Um, at a very granular

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,920
level, our job is to help people find

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,960
answers to questions when they don't

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,119
know where to go at MIT. It is what

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,119
we're good at and we're happy to do it.

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,439
If you're a member of the program,

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,119
certainly that is our duty to you. And

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,200
if you're not a member of the Cobra

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,000
program, we would love to do that job

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
for you and very much more. So again,

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
please do check out our website

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,159
ilp.mmit.edu.

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
You can contact me directly through

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,280
LinkedIn or you can certainly contact

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,880
Fiona and Phil as well. Um all of us are

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,280
discoverable through the MIT website. So

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,600
let's treat this as a beginning. These

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,600
things are not going away and we're

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,000
going to discover a lot more as the

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,880
world continues to evolve in a complex

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,360
direction. But for now, thank you again

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,000
for coming and thank you Fiona and Phil

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,960
for participating and we wish you a good

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
day.
