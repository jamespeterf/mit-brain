00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,759
Hello. Um, I'm Ricard and I will speak

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,719
to you how actions speak louder than

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,080
words and why that's

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,960
important. But first, let's look at some

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,119
examples of this. Did you know that the

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
time you spend in the restroom predicts

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,439
better when you'll quit your job than

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,000
your own estimations?

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
Your grocery uh basket predicts better

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
who you'll vote for than your Instagram

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,719
or social media posts. What you say you

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,600
spend your money on predicts very poorly

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,480
how you end up spending your

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,640
money. But before we go into actions,

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,200
let us talk about the biggest hype right

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,840
now. Large language models. So how does

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,559
uh large language models view language?

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,039
Well, they take a ton of text from the

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,960
internet. They look at these as a

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,520
sequence of words and try to predict the

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,519
next word or token based on previous

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,280
words or token. Right? This is a gist of

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,680
lams. But we can look at behavior in a

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,840
similar way. We do actions in the real

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,080
world. We can sort them chronologically

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,400
and try to predict the next action based

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,960
on previous actions based on data from

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
the real world. So what are the

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,240
implications of this?

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, if you take a um foundation model

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,600
like an LM or a vision model is trained

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
on the internet, it typically

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,960
understands meaning and similarity and

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
relatedness based on features. So we

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,280
tell you in a product setting that

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
lactosefree milk and regular milk are

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,000
similar and related and close because

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
they have similar features. But if you

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,360
instead look at the behavioral

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,439
dimensions and how people act on these

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,360
products, you will see that actually

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,200
lactoseree milk and regular milk are

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,079
very far apart because they're not

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,000
bought together. Instead, it might be

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,799
that lactosefree milk and gluten-free

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,200
bread are more related and close. So you

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,920
need to let users through their behavior

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,159
define meaning.

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,080
So we've been obsessing about behavioral

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,280
intelligence and data for the last five

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,520
years and it's definitely a spectrum of

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,720
the predictiveness and use in usefulness

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,040
of this data. So on the extreme le left

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,599
on noisy data you have what people say

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,120
they want and will do. But as you look

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
at how people spend their time and how

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,959
they invest their money that becomes

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,840
more and more

59
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,920
predictive. So basically LMS are trained

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,080
on the internet which definitely exists

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,319
in this space of what people say they

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,080
want and will do which creates not very

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,800
predictive models in the real world and

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,879
they suffer from hallucinations etc. So

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,360
what we do is that we train large

66
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,360
behavioral models directly in this

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,360
action space from the real world which

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,160
gets which gives much more robust and

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,519
predictive

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,440
models and this also why we're seeing

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,200
that actually LMS are not

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,120
revolutionizing behavd driven businesses

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
an example of behavior-driven businesses

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,319
are retailers and payment companies

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,720
right but the core of retail is not

76
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,200
textbased intelligence from the internet

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,400
the core of retail scale is transactions

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,519
and consumption and that's

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,120
behavior. What we see is that a lot of

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,840
our clients more than 99% of their data

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,440
is transactional and behavioral and they

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,400
need to be able to leverage that fully

83
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,599
to really build competitive

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,879
advantage and that's what we've done

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,280
with behavior GPT. It's a behavior to

86
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,840
behavior foundation model that generates

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
human actions and wants. It's been

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
trained on over one trillion human

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,920
actions and it cost over $5 million just

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,680
to train and it's now out competing LMS

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,120
as the model of choice for

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,360
behavior-driven companies in retail and

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,239
payments. It's the chat GPT moment for

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,239
behavior-driven businesses.

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,720
So some more examples right here we have

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,760
a recommendation engine on the left side

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,959
we have a model that's pre on the

98
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,879
internet it gives you know

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,080
recommendations of similar motives to

100
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,319
this Clint Eastwood uh movie poster and

101
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,560
it gives black and white photos and

102
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,400
motives from old movies. They're all

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
happen to be from romantic movies but

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,199
this is reasonable results but they're

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,639
also incorrect. If you look at the

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,880
behavioral perspective, you see that

107
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,120
people are here are actually looking for

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,639
masculine movie stars from that era and

109
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,639
you could really get that right which

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,320
drives sales and gives happier

111
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,120
users. Uh similarly if you look for

112
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,520
example of you know human experts trying

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,880
to understand what language to describe

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,840
products and motives with to engage

115
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,759
users. Here we have a uh swans, sunset

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,759
etc. And the human experts put these

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,560
labels and keywords. They put nature,

118
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,479
forest, woodlands, all reasonable, but

119
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,440
they're missing the most important one,

120
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,280
which is sunset, which you can get by

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,240
looking at actual customer behavior and

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,240
let them define meaning for

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,360
you. What we see is that we're able on

124
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,759
average to increase sales with 20% on

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,960
existing solutions at these companies.

126
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,320
And we do this with 15 times fewer

127
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,080
people. But we're also allowing to build

128
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,080
completely new revenue streams that they

129
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
thought were impossible before. And

130
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,600
we're no longer being benchmarked

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,880
against existing solutions. The only

132
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
thing they think have the ability to

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,759
beat us are LMS and agents, but they

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
don't stand a

135
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,440
chance. So if you are a behavior driven

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
company, for example, in retail and

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,720
payments, then we're very excited to

138
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,199
talk to you. Thank you so much.

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,199
Thank you, Ricard.
