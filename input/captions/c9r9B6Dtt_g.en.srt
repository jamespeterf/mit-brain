1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,359
uh welcome um on behalf of the MIT

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,200
Administration I'm going to uh start by

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,880
just sharing a few observations uh with

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,839
you about uh research in general

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,400
research at MIT and corporate

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,199
engagements uh with MIT and I'll start

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,640
with what I think is probably um obvious

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,039
to all of you and that's that we are at

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,599
a really unique and special time for uh

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,719
Innovation I've been in MIT for 33 years

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,600
and I can't remember a time where we've

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,079
had such a Confluence of things that are

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,000
all at that sort of hockey stick moment

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,079
um in the curve if you uh think about it

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,440
um a couple decades ago we learned how

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,199
to engineer um life and health but

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,079
because of the complexity of life and

18
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,760
health um we've only scratched the

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,320
surface of what's possible um in that

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,680
domain we're at the beginning of what

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,920
will be the most significant

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,400
transformation of how we power the

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,040
planet and economic prosperity in a

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,640
century you know way from fossil fuels

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,600
to other um sources with really exciting

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,320
things out there um fision Fusion

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,920
renewable

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,880
energy um and we've also designed the

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,520
algorithms and the hardware to make

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,439
inferences from complex data sets that

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,880
far outstrip the ability

32
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,119
of any individual human being to make

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,720
such inferences and we've put that in

34
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,720
the hands of

35
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,479
everyone and now of course we're taking

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,600
things like artificial intelligence and

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,439
using it with you know life and health

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,360
challenges where we have deep complexity

39
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,040
to really Advance things at a rate that

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,600
we haven't seen

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,920
before and then we have new things on

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,759
the horizon things that have benefited

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,159
from you know 50 60 years of development

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,560
and now um you know people think are on

45
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,920
the verge of yet another transition so

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,720
Quantum engineering is one of those

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,280
things and I see uh you know

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,160
presentations that people from that

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
field make where they you know put the

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,959
first quantum computers which we now

51
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,959
have next to the right flyer right that

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,120
they feel were at that kind of a moment

53
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,519
for uh advances in the field so a really

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,480
exciting time and then on our campus and

55
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,239
campus is elsewhere also a deep

56
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,319
realization that we can't develop Tech

57
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,519
devoid from all of the social and

58
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,000
ethical sort of consequences and

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,120
considerations that we must make um in

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,560
developing that kind of um technology

61
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,640
and those advances so it's a really neat

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,560
time I think on campus it's a neat time

63
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:58,879
in the overall field of advancing um

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,840
technology and MIT as gri said is really

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,519
an exceptional place place we have about

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,560
2.3 billion in sponsored research that's

67
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,760
including campus and Lincoln

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,920
Laboratories um and then MIT contributes

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,560
about another 7 or 800 million on top of

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,159
that in our own resources to support the

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,200
um research Enterprise so in some it's

72
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,680
over $3 billion dollar in work that's

73
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,799
being done by some of the most talented

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,239
people in the world we're a fantastic

75
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,840
magnet for talent we've got this great

76
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,000
tradition of Public Service very mission

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,280
driven mindset we like to work with

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,280
people both inside MIT and outside of

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,680
MIT um and have a really sort of

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,480
wonderful role to play I think in

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,200
advancing uh in many of these um key

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,640
fields that are at that sort of hockey

83
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,480
stick uh moment right

84
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,120
now and we've got this marvelous history

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,560
as an arrow and Astro guy I I'll start

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,879
with the one on the upper right A lot of

87
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,640
people say you know that oh we need a

88
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,799
moonshot for this or a moonshot for that

89
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,640
MIT is the only University that can

90
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
actually say that we did the

91
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,079
moonshot right we were the first

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,480
contractor it was a paragraph long that

93
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,720
came from con Congress right to um

94
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,320
campus um that's when you know contracts

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,240
could be a little bit shorter um we you

96
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,120
know basically developed the gu's

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,080
navigation control and computer systems

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,160
to navigate over 240,000 miles of open

99
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,000
space right something that still really

100
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,520
hard

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,960
today you look at the challenges in

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,080
getting back to the

103
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,280
Moon um but can't just talk about aasa

104
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,720
with you guys um first digital computer

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,240
the Whirlwind a Decades of uh Mna

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,479
research and other biological research

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,280
um along with other uh places which put

108
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,960
us in a position um several months into

109
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,960
uh the pandemic to develop vaccines that

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,600
saved thousands and millions of

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,840
lives and then we have the work on radar

112
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,199
that was done at Lincoln um and

113
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,400
continuing work o there over decade

114
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,680
after decade after decade that has

115
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,080
protected the nation and continued to

116
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,600
elevate Lincoln Labs as one of the key

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,680
National Assets for National Security

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,720
right so we got a lot of great things um

119
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,240
in our history and without a doubt we

120
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,120
have some challenges and some

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,319
opportunities that require that kind of

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,319
integrated um thinking across science

123
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:37,560
technology systems economics policy and

124
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,720
we have as Guri mentioned a new

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,600
president who's charged us with

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,120
continuing to do big things together and

127
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,360
you'll hear from our chief Innovation

128
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,720
and strategy officer ananur chander

129
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,639
cassen um who's the key architect in

130
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,560
building those um structures that enable

131
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,800
us to do big things together in these

132
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,360
domains um as shown here so an exciting

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,000
time for us um on campus

134
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,840
but what I want to highlight for you is

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,199
that uh doing big things together is not

136
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,599
just about doing big things together

137
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,680
with people on campus one of The

138
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:18,000
Marvelous things about mit's history is

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,440
that we like to work on real hard

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,319
nitty-gritty engineering problems with

141
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,080
the people who provide products and

142
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,599
services out there in the

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,080
marketplace you know I came from Caltech

144
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,960
I love Caltech as a school but sort of

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
engineering was sometimes used as an

146
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,840
epithet right the higher objective was

147
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,759
you know uh understanding you know

148
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,240
fundamental um uh science at MIT it's

149
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,800
always been part of our sort of DNA to

150
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,360
work on the hard nitty-gritty problems

151
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,440
we've always had a very strong Focus

152
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,720
today about 20% of our sponsored

153
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,680
research is uh industry funded and what

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,080
does that do um it enables us to have a

155
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,800
real appreciation for the problems

156
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,879
and how to solve those not just

157
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
hypothetically but in a

158
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,759
marketplace right where you have real

159
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,360
cost pressures real Market pressures on

160
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,960
you real complexity to deal with where

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,280
you can't always abstract away some of

162
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,680
the challenges that you wish you could

163
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,919
so it promotes this deeper understanding

164
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,440
of the problem it makes us be better at

165
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,280
solving problems it also of course

166
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,120
creates marvelous career opportunities

167
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,919
we have 12,000 students on campus and

168
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,440
not just the grad students are involved

169
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,560
in research but 91% of our undergrads

170
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,840
are involved in research so we have this

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
entire Enterprise that is focused on

172
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,800
advancing the State ofthe art and we

173
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,240
feel that partnering with um industry is

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,199
the way to do that it's really what

175
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,840
enables us to make uh great

176
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,599
progress and I've been here for 33 years

177
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,240
a little over 33 years I've had many

178
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,360
different roles at

179
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,879
MIT uh throughout that I've had very

180
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,840
strong Partnerships with industry and

181
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,840
with government in

182
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,039
policymaking and one of the things that

183
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:15,319
I've observed is that mit's strongest

184
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:19,520
Partnerships those that most benefit our

185
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:22,360
partner and most benefit MIT are those

186
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,000
where people think across just research

187
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,360
and across Human Resources but think

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,879
strategically um including both of those

189
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,680
domains

190
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,039
and most

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,000
universities and most companies you have

192
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,760
to go to the president to find the

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,320
person that has responsibility for both

194
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,320
HR and research and

195
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,640
development right so it's a challenge

196
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,000
both for universities and for corporates

197
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,399
to figure out how do I work in a

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,720
coordinated way across both of those

199
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
domains right don't just send the

200
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,600
technical people to the research and

201
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,360
development conference and the HR people

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,600
to the job fair and you work across both

203
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,240
of those things and there are many many

204
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,880
many opportunities that I'll highlight

205
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,760
for you outside of research at MIT to

206
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,120
get engaged in small ways that will be

207
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:20,040
very impactful in terms of amplifying

208
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,480
the sort of HR co- benefit that you get

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,279
out of um working with MIT on research

210
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,800
and development things and many people

211
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,600
in this room can talk with you about

212
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,800
those there's some listed here but we

213
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,279
had some companies that think so

214
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,160
strategically with us that when we've

215
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,480
hired a junior faculty

216
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,160
member they don't come and work for

217
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,440
MIT but I've called up the CTO of

218
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,200
companies before and said well we've

219
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,160
just hired someone can they come and

220
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200
work for you for the first nine months

221
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,839
and then they're going to come back to

222
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,360
MIT right sounds like a a bad deal right

223
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,560
but what does it do it builds this

224
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
relationship with that company that then

225
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,480
persist persists through that person's

226
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,920
30-year career with them with their

227
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,320
students and also makes them very deeply

228
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,800
aware of the problems that Company's

229
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,959
trying to solve right so there's a a set

230
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,640
of ways to interact with us at a very

231
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,760
high level strategic way big things

232
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,079
small things that that really enable

233
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,440
that partnership between you know

234
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,040
objectives that you would have as a

235
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,839
company HR and Innovation and objectives

236
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,480
that we would have as a university which

237
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,640
are um Education and Research right and

238
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,160
how to bring those two things things

239
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,959
together so something I would have you

240
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,959
think about you're going to hear uh more

241
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,040
because it's the 40th anniversary of the

242
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,760
Micro Systems Technology lab about one

243
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,720
of our most

244
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,959
exceptional um Endeavors in bringing

245
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,839
together Education and Research

246
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,839
partnership between MIT and corporates

247
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,600
um so I don't want to say much more

248
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,399
about that because there's a celebration

249
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,000
of the 40th anniversary coming and

250
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,959
you're going to see many of the

251
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,160
different things they do to to jointly

252
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,959
bring value by by a very strong

253
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,880
strategic collaboration between MIT and

254
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,480
partner

255
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,480
companies so I'm going to end with that

256
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,560
and say that Excellence collaboration

257
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,200
and practical impact are part of our DNA

258
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,279
at MIT what that means is working with

259
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,839
all of

260
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,399
you right and figuring out ways that we

261
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,720
can do things that are jointly valuable

262
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,360
to you and to MIT and we look forward to

263
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,480
working with you to identify those

264
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,760
opportunities there are 50 different

265
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,560
ways uh to interact with you and I would

266
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,720
encourage you to explore uh multiple

267
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,200
ways of doing that you can try them for

268
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
a couple years if they don't work you

269
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,920
can move to other things uh but think

270
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
about it as a vital uh partnership or

271
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,200
collaboration uh between your

272
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,200
organization and our organization uh to

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,519
meet some joint goals okay so welcome

274
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,519
again and thank you for being here

275
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
I can take a few questions I've been

276
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,279
told thank

277
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,959
you a few questions from the uh audience

278
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,000
let's see oh I see them right here yeah

279
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:21,560
do you want me to take them one by one

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,720
yes please okay um what would be the

281
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,600
biggest hurdles for Academia to work

282
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,800
with industry from your

283
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,760
experience um I think the biggest

284
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,760
hurdles that I've seen

285
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,320
on really getting a joint Clarity that

286
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,760
means on both sides about what our goals

287
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,880
are and then driving the sort of

288
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,839
contract structures and the engagements

289
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,120
to enable those um often if we try to do

290
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,600
things without sitting down early and

291
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,600
understanding each other's goals and

292
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,480
being very clear about that and some of

293
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,040
the constraints that we have then it can

294
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,519
be a harder path to get to um the first

295
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,720
contract the other thing that I would

296
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,839
say is that we've sometimes

297
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,880
not done what you would ordinarily do in

298
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,120
any kind of an important relationship

299
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,000
like that which is strategically check

300
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,120
in you know once a year sit down and

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,440
evaluate it what worked what didn't work

302
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,279
what can we change what can we add what

303
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,800
can we remove right but to really uh

304
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,160
give it that care and feeding um and

305
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,480
when we do that um the the opportunities

306
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,839
and the relationships are fantastic so

307
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,560
so it's almost um kinds of things I

308
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,240
would put into the sort of management

309
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,040
101 category right getting clear on

310
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,639
goals um and then checking in and

311
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,240
monitoring progress on it it's not big

312
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,360
complicated things it's the smaller

313
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,160
things that I think really matter um in

314
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,480
terms of um

315
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,720
hurdles great next question would be

316
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,079
what is your biggest takea away from the

317
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:58,880
33 years of MIT experience oh so biggest

318
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,240
takeaway so A lot's changed in 33 years

319
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,079
and

320
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,079
and uh some things are the result of

321
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,720
careful planning other things are the

322
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,440
result of um happy

323
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,839
circumstance uh almost everything though

324
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,079
has some component of patience in it as

325
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,480
well so many of the things that you saw

326
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:23,360
in terms of the great opportunities

327
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,360
benefit from you know 50 60 70 years of

328
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,880
fundamental research uh that lead to

329
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,399
them and we often forget that when we're

330
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,600
in the hockey stick moment we forget the

331
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,959
long stick on the other end right CU

332
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,680
we're all focused on oh what's going to

333
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:39,120
happen next um so so I would say um

334
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,839
sometimes patience really matters uh in

335
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,279
things uh but then also what's happened

336
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,720
in the last 33 years that I've been here

337
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:49,240
is that Mi has always been a marvelous

338
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,320
tech school right we've always been

339
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,360
recognized that way um and we were set

340
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
within a world that had Tech and many

341
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,440
other things but now that world has

342
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,160
become essentially a tech World in a lot

343
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,600
of ways and so it's migrated sort of

344
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,639
towards MIT and those two things

345
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,480
together have really strengthened mit's

346
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,399
opportunities to be a magnet for talent

347
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,639
um the complete Recreation of the sort

348
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,079
of Cambridge and Brader Kendall air

349
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,160
Kendall Square area um so I think just

350
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,000
lots of changes brought about by both

351
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,120
being thoughtful and strategic but also

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,959
being patient you know if you were here

353
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,800
20 or 30 years ago Kendall Square would

354
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,800
not look like this um for people who

355
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,800
have uh a memory it just wouldn't be

356
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,440
that way at all and it's almost hard to

357
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,000
imagine um you know 33 3 years later um

358
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,040
what the place looks like and how strong

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
of a magnet for talent and great

360
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,639
Partnerships MIT

361
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,530
is is that it great thank you very much

362
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,710
thank you guys and welcome again

363
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,710
