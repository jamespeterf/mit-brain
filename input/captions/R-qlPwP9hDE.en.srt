1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,840
Now we'll hear from Chair Van Astrand

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,680
who has since I believe May 2023 chaired

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,680
the Massachusetts Department of Public

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,680
Utilities.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
>> Thank you.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,039
>> Thank you.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,039
Thanks everybody.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,440
So, I really appreciate the opportunity

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,280
to be here. Um, as Andrew mentioned,

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,200
I've been chair of the commission coming

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,440
up on almost two years, May of 2023. Um,

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
and one of the things I inherited was

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,640
what was a pending proceeding in

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Massachusetts called the future of gas

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
proceeding where we issued an order

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,079
that's very relevant to what we've been

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
talking about today. I wanted to provide

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,559
a little bit of know I had to learn when

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,320
I got here and I I I was a law professor

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,680
in West West Virginia University. You

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,239
can imagine the kind of the culture

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,960
shock of going from a coal state to a

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,799
wonderful blue state pursuing a really

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,720
aggressive clean energy targets. But

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
that provides the framework for what

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
we're trying to do at the at the

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
Department of Public Utilities and how

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,200
network geothermal potentially fits into

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,479
that whole message um whole initiative.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
So what's what's the statutory

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,600
framework? What are we doing? And then a

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
little bit about the current

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,159
demonstration projects, but I think you

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
probably heard a lot about those

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,479
already. So one of the things is the

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,280
global warming solutions act of 2008. So

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,759
we're going to be net zero by 2050 and

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,119
then later on the another subsequent

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,880
climate bill says we're going to

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,079
establish sector specific emissions

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,680
reduction targets for 2025 and 2030. So

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,960
that was the clean energy and climate

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,840
plan of June of 2022. And this is just

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,560
an excerpt from that plan. You can see

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,040
um sort of starting off in 1990 and then

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,479
to the far right is 2030. The four

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
various sectors and you can see the

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,560
building sector. You can see that

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,920
reduction that we need to achieve by

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,840
2030. And this is that the the down

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
below just excerpts that building

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
sector. So that's kind of that's what

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
we're striving for in terms of how does

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
this network geothermal fit into how

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,480
does this um the transition the natural

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,640
gas industry? What are we trying to

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,879
accomplish? It's really trying to

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,959
achieve those goals. They're now statuto

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,280
the global warming solution act and the

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,879
fact that the CECP the clean energy and

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,520
climate plan established these sub

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,239
sector targets. So pretty much says

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,560
residential got to get from 15.3 down to

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,680
7.8 and for commercial and the total

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,280
percent reduction 47% reduction. And so

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,519
that's what we're trying to achieve.

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,599
That's that's basically I see my job as

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
a as a regulator is these policy

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
decisions have been made by the

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,040
legislature. my job is to imple

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,599
implement them and try to make that make

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,000
that happen. Um so the statutory

73
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,720
framework I think is Ania talked about

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
this somewhat already but sort of where

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,680
where network geothermal comes in. So

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,000
the 2021 climate bill expressly allowed

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,440
um the gas utilities to propose these

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
these pilot scale projects. Another

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,400
piece that came in the following year

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,920
and you may hear be hearing a lot about

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,319
um GSAP or gas system enhancement plans

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,159
um the gas utilities in Massachusetts

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,840
are spending a lot of money every year

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,879
to address what is referred to in the

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,879
statute as leakprone pipes. So back in

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,599
2014, the gas leaks act was passed that

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,720
basically provided preferential rate

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,280
recovery for costs incurred by the gas

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,159
utilities to to repair or address

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
leakprone pipe. The notion is these are

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
safety issues. They're risk issues.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
Obviously, we have a lot of old

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,159
infrastructure in Massachusetts. So that

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,560
expedited rate recovery um sort of

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,280
removes one of the tools that we have as

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,680
regulators which is called regulatory

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,360
lag that typically a utility will spend

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,159
the money and then it won't recover in

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,599
rates for a while could be a year or two

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,760
years but that gap provides an incentive

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,000
for cost containment. Well, what the gas

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,720
leaks act did in 2014 was pretty much

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,360
say you file your gas system enhancement

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,360
plan with the DPU in October of 31st. we

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,000
have six months to go over it and then

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,720
May one you begin recovering those costs

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,519
in rates. So it provides this expedited

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,400
rate treatment to to um address the

109
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,919
leakprone pipe and then so it's very

110
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,800
controversial. We had a GEP working

111
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,520
group that met through a lot of 2023 to

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,080
figure out that gas leaks act having

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,720
been passed in 2014 focusing primarily

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,400
on the safety issue and the risk issue.

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,440
Then we have the climate bill that says,

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
well, we need to achieve these

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
greenhouse gas reductions. Do we need to

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,800
revisit the gas leaks act in light of

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,560
the the new focus on reducing greenhouse

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,919
gas emissions? And so there's a lot a

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
lot of work is revisiting that. We

122
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,759
currently have those filings in front of

123
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,759
us. We'll be issuing orders in April,

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
April 30th with respect to gas system

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,759
enhancement plans beginning on May 1.

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
But a big thing and how network

127
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,000
geothermal fits into this is the 2022

128
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,880
climate bill. I think Ania might have

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,280
mentioned this but we can basically one

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
means of addressing the leakprone pipe

131
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,479
rather than just replacing it with more

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,240
gas pipe is to replace it with a utility

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
scale non-emitting renewable thermal

134
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,400
energy infrastructure aka geothermal

135
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,680
network. So that is a that is a big

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,320
benefit in terms of um we're trying to

137
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,560
avoid potentially stranded investment by

138
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,039
continuing to replace gas pipes with gas

139
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
pipes that going to last 50 or 60 years.

140
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,240
This says well when you're spending that

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
money on your GEP plan you can actually

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,800
use a thermal energy network would be

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,639
one way of addressing the leakprone pipe

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,639
and avoiding that stranded cost by just

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,960
putting more natural gas infrastructure

146
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,880
into the ground. As Ania mentioned, the

147
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,120
2024 climate bill um actually makes it

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,520
specific that a gas company is allowed

149
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,160
to get in the business of of creating

150
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,880
these thermal energy networks. Um and I

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,720
also mentioned um we're trying to

152
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,240
address this obligation to serve very

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,199
controversial in the states but it's

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,039
basically as as you can see from Ania's

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,039
chart if if you have a a comp a customer

156
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,560
who does not want to give up their gas

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,319
how can you make the case we're going to

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,120
substitute this network geothermal for

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,199
their for your gas very controversial.

160
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,919
So, they took a shot at addressing the

161
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,080
obligation to serve um at least with

162
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,520
respect to new hookups by allowing the

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
consideration of adequate substitutes.

164
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,639
In other words, you might not have a

165
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,080
right to gas service if they're adequate

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,400
substitutes. They're non- gas

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,840
substitutes. Um but we're still working

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,280
our way through this. Um and then that

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,360
eligible infrastructure investment in

170
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,440
these G GE programs is not just

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
replacement and also includes

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
retirement, which means we can actually

173
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,479
take out the pipe. One way of addressing

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
the leak prone pipe is just remove the

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,639
leak prone pipe because you're going to

176
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,080
convert you're going to put customers to

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,440
elect electrification electrified

178
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,720
solutions whether it's ground source

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,039
heat pumps or air source heat pumps.

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,639
So when I got here in May of 2023 I

181
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,680
inherited this docket. It had been

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,000
started in October of 2020 and I think

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,520
the record had closed in October of

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
2022.

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,560
I thought I think we need to probably

186
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,560
issue an order in this in this docket.

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,720
But it was um basically um what is going

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
to be the pathway for the natural gas

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,840
utilities? How do we achieve these

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,680
greenhouse gas reduction targets which

191
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,880
the global warming solutions act and the

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,199
2021 climate bill require us to achieve?

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
And so we issued this order uh basically

194
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,120
ident setting forth this regulatory

195
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,800
framework and what we basically landed

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
on was electrification is going to be

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,039
the primary pathway and that's airsource

198
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
heat pumps ground source heat pumps

199
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,440
which includes the geothermal energy

200
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,199
networks and the way I described what we

201
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
did in that order was basically point

202
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,080
out to this clean energy back the clean

203
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080
energy framework that I had in the first

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,160
couple of slides. We just want to put

205
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,240
the LDC's, the local gas distribution

206
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,039
utilities on a pathway to achieve net

207
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,240
zero by 2050. And so part of that is is

208
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,639
in a couple months, April 1, each LDC

209
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
has to file a climate compliance plan.

210
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,080
In other words, show that you are on a

211
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
pathway that's going to get you to net

212
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,759
zero by 2050. You're going to achieve

213
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,759
those those sub limits that I had that

214
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,840
on that other slide. The other big thing

215
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,919
we did in 2080 was um put the burden on

216
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
the LDC, the local gas distribution

217
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,599
companies. Before you make any

218
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,280
additional investment in natural gas

219
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,599
distribution infrastructure, show that

220
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,919
you considered a non- gas pipeline

221
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,200
alternative. And that could be it could

222
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,880
be energy efficiency, it could be

223
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
electric air source heat pump, ground

224
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,760
source heat pump, network geothermal,

225
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,200
but basically we want to avoid stranded

226
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,599
costs. We want to avoid putting

227
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,519
additional pipe in the ground. So that

228
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,279
was a big element and right now the the

229
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,800
the natural gas distribution companies,

230
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,560
they're all working together. They're

231
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,880
going to be filing with us an agreed

232
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,440
upon natural um non- gas pipeline and

233
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,720
NPA framework and because we need to

234
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
start applying that as as they're coming

235
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,880
in and asking for new additional

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,839
investment. Did have you consider the an

237
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,279
NPA that non- gas pipeline alternative?

238
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,080
And then the other thing I think they

239
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,720
can Ian mentioned um so March one

240
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,040
roughly a year from now then we're

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,720
requiring each LDC to file a target

242
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,040
electrification project. In other words

243
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,760
try to take out a decommission a portion

244
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,680
of a gas service territory in favor of

245
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
of air source heat pump ground source

246
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,000
heat pump electric or network

247
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
geothermal. Um you have to work with

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
your applicable electric distribution

249
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
company because in Massachusetts we have

250
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
some utilities that are both gas and

251
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,519
electric. Sometimes Eversource provides

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,920
the electric and National Grid provides

253
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,600
the gas. You got to come in together.

254
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,120
Um, National Grid actually filed a

255
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
target electrification demonstration

256
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,560
proposal in December of 2024 for the

257
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,839
towns of Lminster and Winthrop where

258
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,360
they're going to try to decommission

259
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,600
part of the gas service territory in

260
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,040
favor of electrification. But that's

261
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,839
going to be a big part of um sort of how

262
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,240
we manage this this this gas transition

263
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,480
is the climate compliance plans and the

264
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,480
role that these that these um

265
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,160
demonstration projects are going to play

266
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
and that's where the obligation to serve

267
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,480
piece is so challenging because when you

268
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,560
look at the chart that Ania had you know

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,079
all it takes is one one customer who

270
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
says I don't want to give up my gas and

271
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,519
you're not able to take out that you're

272
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,959
not able to decommission the pipe and

273
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
the number and the numbers just don't

274
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,519
work all that well if you can't

275
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,920
decommission the pipe. type. So that's

276
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,600
why states are struggling with how can

277
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,480
we how can we substitute um the

278
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,800
basically a another means of providing

279
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,200
the essential service of heat instead of

280
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,920
instead of natural gas.

281
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,640
So, one of the things that um it's it's

282
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,040
helpful along the lines of of of NEO's

283
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
discussion of the demonstration projects

284
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,320
because the 2021 climate bill

285
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,640
specifically authorizes the gas

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,760
companies to file with us demonstration

287
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,440
projects proposals and and it it lays

288
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
out some criteria. So when we look at

289
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,320
these demonstration projects when

290
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
Framingham comes in, whenever source

291
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
comes in with the Framingham project and

292
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,240
National Grid comes in for the Lel and

293
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,079
and Franklin Fields projects, these are

294
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
the criteria that we are going to apply

295
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
and in determining the rate treatment,

296
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,040
the rate recovery of those of those

297
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,079
costs. Um pretty straightforward. Must

298
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,600
have reasonable likelihood of

299
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,959
facilitating substantial reductions.

300
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
That goes back to achieving those

301
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,880
greenhouse gas limits. We don't want you

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,200
don't want you to blend in hydrogen and

303
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,320
RNG and we need to use a third party

304
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,760
evaluation. And then we consider the

305
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
reasonleness of the size, scope and

306
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,760
scale. In other words, do the benefits

307
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
justify the proposed cost. And another

308
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,959
key element is the calculation of

309
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
benefits must include the calculations

310
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,399
of the social value of greenhouse gas

311
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,880
emissions reduction. That's going to be

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,320
a good way of when you're looking at

313
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,600
those costs and benefits that you're

314
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
going to put a price on carbon,

315
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,320
basically the carbon that you're

316
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,000
avoiding by taking out that natural gas

317
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,800
infrastructure and replacing it with

318
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,839
with something else. So, real briefly, I

319
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
think you're going to hear a lot about

320
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,560
the Framingham project that Eversource

321
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,399
has done. There's a phase two that was

322
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,680
awarded a preliminary grant, I think, by

323
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,959
the Department of Energy, which is

324
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,079
caught up in all this stuff that's going

325
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,120
on in Washington DC right now. Um, n so

326
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,920
that was approved in the in the

327
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,760
Eversource rate case from from 2020,

328
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
DPU19120.

329
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,680
And then National Grid had a separate

330
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,200
proceeding where this is before I got

331
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,519
here, of course, but authorizing up to

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,160
15.6 million for four network geothermal

333
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
projects. the first of which was in l

334
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,440
and I think national good has announced

335
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,519
that they are they are terminating that

336
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
project um I think just the level of

337
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,519
participation wasn't as wasn't as great

338
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,360
the numbers didn't didn't work very well

339
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,959
but they've also filed for the Franklin

340
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,360
field apartments with the Boston Housing

341
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,279
Authority and so that's that project is

342
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,560
is moving forward and then we'll be

343
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,399
looking like I say we'll be applying

344
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
those criteria then we consider the rate

345
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,240
recovery treatment of these of these

346
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,279
demonstration projects so with that I'm

347
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,279
happy to answer questions Sir,

348
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
whatever.
