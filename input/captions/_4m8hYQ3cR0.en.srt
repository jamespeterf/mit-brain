1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,960
Okay. So let me first remind you uh

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,960
about so we we'll be looking so last

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,960
time

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,439
then we were looking at we had a

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,920
sequence of functions

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:38,000
uh on a interval I

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,160
uh and we have a function f on that same

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,719
interval.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,719
And then we talked about two notions of

10
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,719
convergence.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,760
Uh

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,760
one is was the pointwise convergence.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:15,960
So this meant that so we say that this

14
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,960
sequence converts to f pointwise

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,880
if for all

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,720
x fixed

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,840
you're looking at the sequence fn of x

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,280
right so x is fixed and that this here

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,520
converts to f ofx right so that was the

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,680
pointwise convergence

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:47,119
And the second uh convergence that we

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:49,280
talked about was a uniform convergence.

23
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,280
So this is two

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,280
uniform

25
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,399
convergence,

26
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,920
right? And so we say that this sequence

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,920
here converts to F uniformly.

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,200
if

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,560
um for all epsilon greater than zero

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,120
there exist a n so that if you're

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,520
further out

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,520
then n then the difference

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,879
between fn of x and f ofx is smaller

34
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,280
than epsilon and this here has to hold

35
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,239
for all

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,560
uh X

37
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:45,280
right and so again uniform uniform

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,599
uh refers to that is that is for all

39
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,040
for all x

40
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,400
right so it's uniform in x

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,400
okay and and so there was one example

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,160
that was particular illuminating

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,599
uh

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:08,159
and that was that we took so if I here

45
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,080
was the interval from 0 to 1.

46
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:17,440
And if we're looking at the function

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:21,360
f(n) of x that was just x ^ n and f of x

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,519
is then the function that is uh that is

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
zero

50
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,159
uh unless

51
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,920
zero if x here is between zero and

52
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:38,239
strictly less than one and one

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:43,680
uh if x is equal to one. Right?

54
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:46,720
And so the picture was that um

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,519
right so the picture was that so that

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,360
you have this sequence here they are

57
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:58,400
defined on the interval from zero to one

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,920
they all end up at one and then as as n

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,799
go as n become larger and larger these

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,239
functions become more and more steep

61
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,640
towards one right like that Right? And

62
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:16,000
so then we had that this sequence fn

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,799
converts to f pointwise

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,440
because if you fixed

65
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:27,120
x then really these values here converge

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:31,600
either to if you know if x is not equal

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,160
to one then as n become large

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,919
uh they converge to zero. If n is one

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:42,000
then the fn of one is that's always one

70
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:47,840
right. So, so it's clear that it's

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,919
converging pointwise, but but um but fn

72
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,919
does not converge does not

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,000
not converge

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,400
to f uniformly,

75
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,880
right? And the reason why it didn't

76
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,919
converge uniformly was that we saw that

77
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,639
for each if we by the intermediate value

78
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,759
theorem if we were looking at a half

79
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,400
here then for each of the function there

80
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,639
would be an xn

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,000
so that the value at xn was one right

82
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,360
and so was a half sorry the right so you

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,960
you define x xn so that the value of

84
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:46,080
this is a half. But now if you're

85
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:48,240
looking at f of x minus f of um of xn

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,440
like that.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,280
And if this here sorry is n then this

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,400
here this difference here is is is is

89
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,960
actually just a half. Right? And this

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,199
difference here should be small. If n

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,000
was sufficiently large, it should be

92
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:11,520
small for all x. But it's not there. We

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,240
used one particular x to show that it

94
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,240
wasn't right.

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,120
Okay. Um that was just a quick uh review

96
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,600
of some of the things we talked about

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,880
last time. Now

98
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,280
let's get to a theorem.

99
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,600
And so maybe also one more thing about

100
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,240
this example is

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,560
that you see that these functions here

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,080
these functions fn

103
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,639
they are all continuous right but the

104
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:51,560
limit is not continuous right so

105
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,560
pointwise so note that uh so note

106
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,039
that pointwise convergence

107
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Um

108
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,639
is not enough

109
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,520
to guarantee

110
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,840
that limits

111
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,880
of continuous functions

112
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:39,800
uh um that that the limit

113
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,800
of continuous function is continuous.

114
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,759
Right?

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,240
Okay. So that's what this example

116
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,360
illustrates. So now instead we have the

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,280
following theorem that so we have this

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,160
interval and we have a sequence fn and

119
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:06,879
we have f all defined on this interval

120
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,919
and if we assume that uh that all of

121
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,599
these that these fns

122
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,599
are uh continuous

123
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,160
and B. We assume that the convergence

124
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,039
here

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,039
the convergence of FN to to F is

126
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,039
uniform.

127
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,640
Then the claim is that then

128
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,039
then

129
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,039
uh f here is also continuous.

130
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,299
[Applause]

131
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,160
I'm okay. So let's try to prove that

132
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,600
right. So so point mass convergence is

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,519
not enough to guarantee that the limit

134
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,839
is continuous. Uniform convergence is

135
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:04,560
enough.

136
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,560
Uh now uh let's see. So let's prove

137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,560
that.

138
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,519
So uh given

139
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,160
given epsilon gradient zero

140
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,399
uh there exist

141
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,399
there exist

142
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:32,720
uh capital n such that

143
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:37,519
if little n is bigger equal to capital n

144
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,839
then fn of x minus f ofx

145
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,320
is smaller than uh epsilon over three

146
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,320
for all x.

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,080
Right? This is just this just follows

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,120
from that the sequence converts

149
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,000
uniformly. Right? So this is the first

150
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,000
thing

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,560
and the second thing is so so

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,560
this was was since fn converts to f

153
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,560
uniformly.

154
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,440
The second thing is that's that. So now

155
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,320
we have a n this here holds for all

156
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,440
little n bigger equal to capital n but

157
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,720
in particular it holds for capital n. So

158
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,240
now since

159
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,120
f capital n is continuous so this is a

160
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,120
fixed function. Now

161
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,000
uh then

162
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,519
then

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,700
given then for any

164
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,800
for any fixed

165
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:59,720
[Applause]

166
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,720
X0 we have

167
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,160
that

168
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,160
uh we have that there exist

169
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:23,519
uh delta greater than zero such that

170
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:26,160
if x - x0 is smaller than delta then uh

171
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,920
this function the value at these two

172
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,959
points points differ at most.

173
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,240
So this is for the fn.

174
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,160
Um the value at these two points differ

175
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,760
at most

176
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,760
by um epsilon over.

177
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,360
Right? So again, so we have a sequence

178
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:52,320
fn f little n that converts uniformly to

179
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,800
some f. We want to prove that this f is

180
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,920
continuous. So we just need to prove

181
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,600
that for each x0 fixed it's continuous

182
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,480
at x0 right first I'm using that the

183
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,200
sequence is converging uniformly

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,760
so given this epsilon there exist this

185
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,160
capital n so that if you're further out

186
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,959
then you have this I'm not even going to

187
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,240
use the part that is further out I'm

188
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,680
just going to pick this capital n right

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,120
and so then I'm using that this f

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,480
capital n is continuous and it's

191
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,079
continuous at x0. So I have this right

192
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,720
and so now we need to estimate

193
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:39,519
we now need to estimate the difference

194
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,440
right so what we really interested is in

195
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,560
f but the f capital n that's going to

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,880
help us estimate the difference between

197
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,720
these two numbers

198
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,560
and so these two numbers so x here x was

199
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:00,399
this x0 was this fixed point that we

200
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:04,399
want to show that that f is continuous

201
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,880
uh at that point and the delta well the

202
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,839
delta came from

203
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:15,120
f capital n. So we're looking at this x

204
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:19,600
this close where the delta was given by

205
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,240
f capital n and now we have we use the

206
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,959
triangle inequality. So this difference

207
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,600
here is so you may as well think about

208
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:32,079
this one here and you could compare it

209
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,240
with the value at the same point. So I'm

210
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,800
just writing down I'm writing this

211
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,880
difference down as a sum of things. So

212
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,240
and then afterwards I use the triangle

213
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:49,680
inequality. So here minus f capital n of

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:54,240
x0 and then I'm adding back this here

215
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,680
again f capital n of x0 and I'm

216
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,000
comparing this with f of x0

217
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,160
right so you see that here this is

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,920
really the same because here I'm

219
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,240
subtracting this thing that I didn't

220
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,920
have but I'm adding it back subtracting

221
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
this thing that I didn't have but I'm

222
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,880
adding it back so I'm just left with

223
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,720
those two things which is that

224
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,560
And so now we use the triangle

225
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,560
inequality

226
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:24,000
that this is now bounded by f ofx minus

227
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,600
f n of x

228
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,199
plus f n of x

229
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:39,279
minus f capital n of x0 like that plus

230
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:43,519
and then f capital n of x0 minus f of x0

231
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,279
with absolute value sign like that.

232
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,600
Now

233
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,279
this thing here is smaller than epsilon

234
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,320
over three and that came from that it's

235
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,399
at this evaluated at the same point and

236
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,760
the convergence was uniform. So it

237
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:04,639
really was the first part here right so

238
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,040
that is less than epsilon over 3.

239
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:12,399
This one here comes from that the

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,680
difference between x and x0 is is less

241
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:20,240
than delta and that this function fn was

242
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,120
continuous at uh x0. So this is another

243
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
epsilon over delta. This is this second

244
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,240
part here.

245
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,639
And then the last here is again the same

246
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,880
that gave us this bound namely that the

247
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,440
convergence was uniform and is evaluated

248
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:41,360
at the same point. So you have that

249
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,440
right and so what we've proven here is

250
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,959
that so for this given x0 if the

251
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,759
difference between x and x0 is less than

252
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,320
delta then the difference in the images

253
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:59,519
is less than epsilon. So this means that

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:06,320
the function f is continuous at x0

255
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:08,000
um and x0 was was was arbitrary. Okay.

256
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,959
Now

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,079
um

258
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:20,519
now the first application of this is

259
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,519
that suppose you take

260
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,839
suppose you're looking at the following

261
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:33,040
example

262
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:38,240
uh uh x n of x is the sum here from k =

263
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:43,279
z to n of x k over k factorial. Suppose

264
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:48,000
you're looking at xn like this.

265
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:53,519
Then uh then the xn here

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,920
of x uh they are all are all continuous

267
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,519
right? They are sum of polinomials you

268
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,880
know they're just a polinomial actually

269
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,440
the sum of of um

270
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,120
of of of of what's called homogeneous

271
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,280
polinomial but they are themselves

272
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,280
polomial so they are all continuous

273
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,400
um and via stress M test so and by

274
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,160
v stress

275
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,640
M test that we proved last time

276
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,960
by a bias M test the convergence here

277
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,320
to

278
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,200
E where E here is the exponential

279
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:49,440
function. So it's this power series sum

280
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:52,320
from uh k = 0 to infinity of x to the

281
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,559
power k over k factorial. The

282
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,840
convergence this convergence here is

283
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,880
uniform. It's uniform

284
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,559
assuming that you that you do it on a

285
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,559
compact interval. So it's uniform

286
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,160
on any

287
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,160
fixed interval.

288
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,720
of the form

289
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,720
say

290
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,240
minus L to L right so if you're fixing a

291
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,679
interval like this then the convergence

292
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:36,080
is is uniform and so this means that

293
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:39,200
since these guys here are continuous

294
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,919
then it implies that this one here is

295
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,919
also continuous Yes.

296
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:53,240
Right. So this is this is implied by the

297
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,240
theorem that we just proved.

298
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,480
Now

299
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,400
uh so now this will uh this will uniform

300
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,559
convergence.

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,120
There's another way of thinking about

302
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,720
uniform convergence

303
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:15,360
that in a way is

304
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,240
this makes it makes it more natural.

305
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,679
So because so

306
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,799
remember that if we looked at so if we

307
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,080
take a interval let's say

308
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,200
that this is a interval from a to b a

309
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,280
and b are real numbers

310
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,679
then we looked at the space of

311
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,799
continuous functions

312
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,400
on this interval right

313
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,480
and this space had a natural metric so

314
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,559
uh so so I'm using here that both end

315
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,280
points are included included. This space

316
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,080
here has a natural

317
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,080
a natural metric

318
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,240
and that metric is that if you take two

319
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,480
functions,

320
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,200
two continuous functions on the

321
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
interval, then the distance between

322
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,200
these two function

323
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:18,240
is just the max

324
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,480
of the um of the the max of the

325
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,360
difference

326
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,360
between the two functions,

327
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,400
right? The difference again why is this

328
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,159
by the difference is continuous. So this

329
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,159
means that the maximum is the difference

330
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,080
is continuous. So this is a continuous

331
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,320
function and it's still continuous. If

332
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,720
you take absolute value and so this

333
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,200
means that the maximum by the extreme

334
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,760
value theorem is achieved. Right?

335
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,280
Right. And so this here was a natural uh

336
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,280
distance between them. Right. Now to say

337
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:07,039
that the sequence here to say that the

338
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,559
sequence f little n is converging

339
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,559
uniformly

340
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,159
you can think about that in terms of

341
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,200
this distance. So,

342
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,200
so we have the following proposition.

343
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,440
FN converge uniformly

344
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,799
to F

345
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,280
if and only if

346
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:41,960
uh FN

347
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,960
converts to F in the metric space.

348
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:59,919
with this with this metric. Okay.

349
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,200
Now, why is this the case? So this is

350
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:06,159
just that uh so proof of that it's

351
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:12,240
really just a oneliner because the you

352
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:14,240
see that to say that the so that so that

353
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,000
f ofx

354
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,520
minus fn of x

355
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,600
is lesser equal to

356
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:30,360
uh

357
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,360
uh to uh epsilon for all X.

358
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,600
If this here is the case, well, this is

359
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,919
equivalent to saying

360
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,320
that the distance

361
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,120
between FN

362
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:50,679
and uh NF

363
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,679
is less or equal to epsilon for all X.

364
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,720
Right? Because if this here is the case

365
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,360
for all x then the maximum is less or

366
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,280
equal to epsilon. This was the maximum.

367
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,400
And on the other hand if the maximum

368
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,440
well then it holds for each x right. So

369
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,440
this is sort of a tology.

370
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay. And so now we see of course that

371
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:19,240
if if the sequence so you have that but

372
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,240
this means

373
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,039
so this means that if the sequence

374
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,039
therefore

375
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,840
if this sequence fn converts to f

376
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
uniformly

377
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,000
well then it means that for all epsilon.

378
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,600
If we're sufficiently far out, then this

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,679
here can be for any given epsilon. If

380
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,679
you're sufficiently far out, this here

381
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,280
can be made lesser equal to epsilon,

382
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
which means that this hair can be made

383
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,520
lesser equal to epsilon if you're

384
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,400
sufficiently far out. So you see that if

385
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,200
this converts uniformly, then it implies

386
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,200
that this thing here

387
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,039
converts to zero.

388
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,760
But that's exactly what it means that

389
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:16,679
this sequence fn converts to f

390
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,679
in in the met in the metric space

391
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,000
and the other way around.

392
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,039
If if this sequence converts fn converts

393
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,960
to f in the metric space, this is

394
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,400
equivalent to saying that this hair goes

395
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,640
to zero. But if this hair goes to zero,

396
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,880
right? This means that if you're

397
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,039
sufficiently far out, but given epsilon,

398
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,360
if you're sufficiently far, this hair is

399
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,039
lesser equal to epsilon, but it means

400
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,880
that this hair is less than epsilon,

401
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,080
right? So that means it really converts

402
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,720
uniform, right?

403
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,279
Okay.

404
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:05,760
And that's a in a way that makes it much

405
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:07,360
more natural. Uh I mean yeah the so it's

406
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,240
um

407
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,000
un it makes uniform convergence much

408
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,960
more natural.

409
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,880
Okay. So now let's prove the next

410
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,000
theorem.

411
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,480
So for this theorem

412
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,640
we're going to think about uniform

413
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,720
convergence

414
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,840
in terms of this metric and in terms of

415
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,320
convergent in this metric space. So the

416
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,559
theorem is then

417
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,919
this next thing that say that if you

418
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,600
take a interval from a to b

419
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,279
and you're looking at the continuous

420
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,840
function

421
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,080
and you equip it with this metric that

422
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,279
we talked about

423
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:58,120
then this here is this space which is a

424
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,120
metric space. So this metric space

425
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,960
is a cushy complete.

426
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,720
Okay.

427
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,240
So remember kle in a metric space means

428
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:23,039
that if you take a cushy sequence so

429
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:28,000
just let me just record here over here.

430
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:31,880
So uh cush so if x comma d

431
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,880
is a matrix space.

432
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,120
Then C complete

433
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:52,919
means

434
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,919
that any secret

435
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,559
uh is convergence,

436
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,279
right? That's what it means to be a

437
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,440
cushy complete. And of course, an

438
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:18,960
example of of a cushy complete

439
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:24,200
um metric space was just if we took R

440
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,200
with the usual with the usual metric

441
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:33,000
Okay. Down. So what we have here is so

442
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,000
let's try to prove this.

443
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,120
So we need to prove so

444
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:43,279
so this here is now we need to prove

445
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,760
that if this here is a

446
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,760
cushy sequence

447
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,039
then uh then

448
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,039
there exist

449
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:07,000
[Applause]

450
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,000
an function that is also continuous.

451
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,760
And so this sequence here converging to

452
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,440
f

453
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,440
uh in the metric

454
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,360
D, right? That's what we need to prove.

455
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:31,440
Okay. So in in in in particular we need

456
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,840
to first construct a function

457
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,080
f right.

458
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,000
[Applause]

459
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,000
So now so let's try first to construct a

460
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
function.

461
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,600
So,

462
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,600
so we first

463
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,960
construct

464
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,120
f as follows.

465
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,840
Well, if you fix

466
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,480
fix x, right? So x is something a point

467
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,720
in the interval.

468
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:24,559
And now look at this sequence fn. This

469
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,279
is now a regular sequence.

470
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:30,960
And so but if you're looking at the

471
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:37,440
sequence then we have that fn

472
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:40,240
of x minus f m of x. If you have two n

473
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,480
and m like this, then the difference

474
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,880
here is lesser equal to

475
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,200
the max

476
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:54,000
where this is for all set in the

477
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:59,600
interval

478
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,320
of um of f mn

479
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:09,039
of set

480
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:12,399
minus uh fm um of set

481
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:16,159
like that right because of course you

482
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:21,480
know it means like in particular if x

483
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,480
set was x right so you have clearly this

484
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,760
but now you see that uh so I claim so I

485
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,000
claim that this means so there so I

486
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,840
claim

487
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,399
that this implies that the this that

488
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,399
this implies

489
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:47,360
that this sequence here.

490
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,960
Sorry. This sequence here fn of x this

491
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:55,360
sequence here is a which is a sequence

492
00:30:50,960 --> 00:31:01,080
of real numbers. is here real numbers

493
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,080
that this here is a cy sequence

494
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,000
of real numbers.

495
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,520
Why

496
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,760
why is that the case? Well, it's the

497
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,760
case because

498
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,399
because given

499
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,640
so this is just because given given so

500
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,640
this is

501
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,159
the case

502
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,399
because

503
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,039
given

504
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:45,519
epsilon greater than zero

505
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:51,320
since

506
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,320
fn N is a C sequence.

507
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,000
In the metric space

508
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,399
in this metric space then um there exist

509
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:16,960
capital N. So that if little n and

510
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,679
little m are bigger than capital n then

511
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,919
the difference between these guys sorry

512
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,159
the difference between this function

513
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,480
here and that function

514
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,240
is less than epsilon

515
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,360
right this is because the work sequence

516
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,080
and so now this thing here is of course

517
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,480
this thing here that's what we just saw

518
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,760
this is like the maximum form. So this

519
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,240
is bigger than when you evaluate it in

520
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,240
just one point

521
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,120
like that, right?

522
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,880
And so so this proves

523
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,240
this proved right that that this when x

524
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,880
is fixed these guys here is a cy

525
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,159
sequence of real numbers.

526
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:13,880
So now we use since

527
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,880
r here is cushy complete

528
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,799
and

529
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,799
fn of x is a cushy sequence.

530
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:37,279
then it means that uh that the sequence

531
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:40,720
fn of x that this is converging

532
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:44,559
and it's converging to some number right

533
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,799
so just one number and that number we

534
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:52,799
can call

535
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:55,600
f ofx right so we just defined f to be

536
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,120
the limit of this sequence right and

537
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,600
that's what defined because there's just

538
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,240
one number right so for each x it gives

539
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:07,640
you a number.

540
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,640
Okay. So now what we have proven is

541
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,079
that so now we have a candidate

542
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,000
so namely we have shown

543
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,320
that

544
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,879
so now what you have we've proven here

545
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,040
is

546
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:29,359
that we have found a function. So we

547
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:33,200
have now proven that this sequence here

548
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:38,040
is converging to some function f the

549
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,040
convergence is just pointwise

550
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,320
and we don't know whether this function

551
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,240
is continuous or not right it's the

552
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,399
convergence is pointwise this is just

553
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:54,079
because it convert for each fixed x it

554
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,760
was f of f ofx was defined so that it

555
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,880
was a limit of these guys fn of x right

556
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,240
okay so now we need to promote this

557
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,880
convergence so the point was pointwise

558
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,599
and we need to promote the convergence

559
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:15,720
to uniform convergence right and so so

560
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,720
now we need so now

561
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,480
uh given

562
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:27,440
so given epsilon greater than zero

563
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,440
again Since since these guys FN was a CC

564
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,440
sequence

565
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,440
in the metric space in

566
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,240
in this metric space

567
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,240
then then as we saw over there they

568
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,240
exist

569
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,280
there exist capital N. So that if little

570
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:02,480
n and and little m are bigger than this

571
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:10,000
capital n then uh then the difference

572
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:12,240
between these two then fn of x - fm of x

573
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,599
this thing here

574
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:21,880
is lesser equal to

575
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,880
and I'm using epsilon / two for all X.

576
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,079
Okay.

577
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:36,960
So you have that

578
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:39,920
but now this here holds for all M and N,

579
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,960
right? Let's just fix N.

580
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,560
And now we can use that it's it's still

581
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,839
true. I can still let M vary, right? And

582
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,960
so if you let m go. So now letting so

583
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:58,800
fixed fix

584
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:03,440
n bigger than capital n and

585
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,800
let little m goes to infinity.

586
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,680
Right? Well

587
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,800
this here is just some fixed number. But

588
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,000
as m go to infinity this here go to f

589
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,599
ofx. Right? And so since this difference

590
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,839
is always less or equal to epsilon /

591
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,160
two, it's also the case that the

592
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,640
difference here

593
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,640
of the limit

594
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,359
is lesser or equal

595
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,760
to epsilon / two. So you have this here

596
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,760
for all x,

597
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:48,240
right? This is just letting m goes to uh

598
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,000
to the limit.

599
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,280
But this of course say this say that

600
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,240
that the max if you will. So you have

601
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:05,280
that. So this implies

602
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:09,359
that the max of fn of x minus f ofx

603
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,240
that this thing here where x is now in

604
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,079
this interval that this is lesser equal

605
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,760
to epsilon.

606
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,160
Right?

607
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,640
And but this is like the same this here

608
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,599
is just the distance between fn

609
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,079
and f right. So say that this distance

610
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,400
here here is less than uh I guess I had

611
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,359
epsilon / two. So it means that this

612
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,000
thing here is less than strictly less

613
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,000
than epsilon. It's actually less or

614
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,920
equal to epsilon / two. So it's strictly

615
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,480
less than epsilon.

616
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,320
But that's exactly what it means for

617
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:53,839
this sequence here. So this is the same

618
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:57,160
this is the same

619
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,160
as saying

620
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,720
that fn converts to f uniformly.

621
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,280
right

622
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,119
here. Sorry, here I should have taken

623
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,720
the soup. The reason

624
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,520
why I should take the soup here is

625
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,599
that f is just a function. It's not

626
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,839
necessarily continuous at this stage.

627
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,440
Right? So, but it was clearly the case

628
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,160
with soup. So, the maximum appro may not

629
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,320
be achieved yet. But now you see that

630
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,720
they converge

631
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,839
these fn converge to f uniformly right.

632
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,920
But then and these these guys here was

633
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:49,280
continuous. Right? These are continuous.

634
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:53,760
So this implies that by this theorem we

635
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,560
just proved that f is also continuous.

636
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,839
Right? And so you see that so now you

637
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,839
have that the limit is indeed in the

638
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:07,200
space and we already proved here that

639
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,920
the convergence to this limit is is is

640
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:15,000
in is uniform which means that it's it's

641
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,000
in that in the metric. Okay.

642
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,000
The next thing is that right so this is

643
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,079
this here was just a little bit

644
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,079
different way of thinking about uniform

645
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,119
convergence that you think about it sort

646
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,440
of more abstractly as a convergence in a

647
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,920
metric space right and it's a useful way

648
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,440
of thinking about it the next thing we

649
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,960
want to look at is

650
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,079
how this uniform convergence

651
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,880
uh gives you a way of uh computing

652
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,280
things. So in particular if you have

653
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,800
some power series

654
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,960
um and so and we talked about that a

655
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,480
little bit last time we didn't prove

656
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,760
anything

657
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,160
but one of the one of the motivation for

658
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,960
this is that suppose you take a power

659
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,960
series like this

660
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,400
and we we'll return to this in just a

661
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,839
second but suppose you take a power

662
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,319
series like this and You are inside the

663
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,320
radius of convergence. So inside

664
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,499
radius of convergence.

665
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,499
[Applause]

666
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,440
So you know that this thing here makes

667
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,359
sense, right? That this for each x gives

668
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,599
you a number.

669
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,839
And so it gives you a function. And so

670
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,560
you're interested in what is the

671
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,040
derivative of that function and what is

672
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,800
the what is the integral of that

673
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,280
function. How do we integrate it and how

674
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,839
do we take the derivative? And the thing

675
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,079
that worries you a bit is that it's if

676
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,880
it was just a finite sum, it would be

677
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,319
trivial. But it's a infinite sum, right?

678
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,119
And so is it okay? So the the natural

679
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:05,359
question is is it okay if you want to

680
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:07,839
take the derivative, can you interchange

681
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,800
this infinite sum with taking

682
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,920
derivative? And likewise, if you want to

683
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,760
integrate this infinite sum, is it okay

684
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,480
to inter interchange the infinite sum

685
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,560
with taking the integral? And the and

686
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:28,319
the answer is it's okay. Okay. And so

687
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,160
let's see that. So we do this. So we

688
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,960
have two versions of this. One that's

689
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,119
dealing with taking integrals and

690
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,119
another version that deals with taking

691
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,119
derivatives.

692
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,079
Okay.

693
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,880
And so the first thing is that I take so

694
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,599
first theorem is the following

695
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,880
that I have some interval

696
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,599
from a to b.

697
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,119
Um

698
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,920
um and then I have a sequence of

699
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,880
functions fn

700
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,960
that are um that are integraable.

701
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,839
They may not be continuous. They're just

702
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,200
integraable.

703
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,280
So in particular they are uh they are

704
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:28,160
bounded.

705
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,800
And then I have that uh fn here

706
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,359
converts to

707
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,359
f uniform.

708
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:45,400
Okay. And I want to prove that. So the

709
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,400
claim is that

710
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:54,280
that fm

711
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,280
is also integraable

712
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,040
and the integral

713
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:05,680
of f

714
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,640
is equal to uh the limit

715
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,640
of these integrals.

716
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,520
Okay.

717
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,160
So, so in particular, of course,

718
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,880
those integral here has a limit, right?

719
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,880
It's part of the statement.

720
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:42,250
[Applause]

721
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,920
Okay.

722
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,480
Um

723
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:04,880
right. So now um

724
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,920
Right. So what do we want to what do we

725
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,920
need to prove? So prove

726
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:16,520
remember that. So we want to show So we

727
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,520
first want to show

728
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,400
that

729
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,400
f is integraable

730
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,839
and we had a criteria for doing that. So

731
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,720
we're using the criteria.

732
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,720
So we can use

733
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,920
that's uh all we need to show

734
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,599
to show

735
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:57,960
is the following that given

736
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,960
given epsilon greater than zero

737
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,880
there exist

738
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,400
there exist a partition P of of the

739
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,800
interval

740
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:15,119
from A to B

741
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:18,960
so that uh so that the upper sum of f

742
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:23,760
with respect to this partition

743
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:27,200
minus the lower sum of f with respect to

744
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,200
the same partition that this thing here

745
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,280
is less than epsilon right that's all we

746
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,760
need to prove we need to prove

747
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,040
For each epsilon we need to prove that

748
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:40,160
there exist a partition. Right? So if we

749
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,760
have that then we already know that then

750
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,400
f is integral. Okay. And then then so

751
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,240
that's just achieve this this first task

752
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,800
and then afterwards we need to prove

753
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,800
that.

754
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,800
No,

755
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,000
right. Okay. So now how do we prove

756
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,839
that?

757
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,599
So

758
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:21,599
um so the first thing we observe is

759
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:25,440
that if we take uh if we're looking at

760
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:30,079
uh suppose that f n

761
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,640
and f here suppose that this um suppose

762
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,400
that fn of x

763
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,440
minus uh f ofx

764
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,960
suppose that this thing here was less

765
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,160
than

766
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:48,079
uh was less than

767
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,119
epsilon over 3

768
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:54,640
b minus a.

769
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,800
Okay, suppose you have that

770
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,000
and you can of course this here can be

771
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,599
achieved, right? This here can so

772
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,040
epsilon is now given, right? And so you

773
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:13,839
have that so so maybe I should just say

774
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:19,640
that uh so epsilon is given. So since

775
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:19,640
fn converts to f uniformly

776
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,040
this means that there exist there exist

777
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:34,400
capital n so that if you're further out

778
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:39,119
than capital n then actually you have

779
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,520
this thing here right b minus b b and a

780
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:46,079
are fixed this is just something fixed.

781
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:49,440
So this is just another epsilon, right?

782
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,520
Okay. So if you have that now suppose

783
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,720
you take

784
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:58,319
uh so remember we defined when we do uh

785
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,680
did the when we had the partition the

786
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:05,559
partition had the dividing points

787
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,559
with dividing points

788
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:18,559
x i. So we were looking at these small

789
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:22,480
intervals x i from x i minus one to x i

790
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:25,480
and we're looking at the soup of the

791
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,480
function.

792
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,480
So if you're looking at the soup of

793
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,920
suppose you're looking at so this here

794
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,520
is on this little interval

795
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:39,920
but it's for f right

796
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,559
but the function f here you see the

797
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:46,720
function. So you have that f of x

798
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,160
this function here sorry I don't need

799
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:56,319
the absolute value but f ofx is less or

800
00:49:50,160 --> 00:50:02,000
equal to uh f uh n of x

801
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:05,000
uh plus of course uh f of x minus f n of

802
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
x

803
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:15,040
right and so this means that this thing

804
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,440
here is by this thing here is less or

805
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:24,839
equal to fn of x. This thing here is

806
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,839
bounded by the absolute value of it,

807
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,839
right? And and so this thing here so

808
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:40,319
this is fn of x and this here is just

809
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,760
epsilon over

810
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,319
over 3

811
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,599
uh b minus a

812
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:52,800
like that right

813
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,000
so this means that if I take the soup on

814
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,040
this little interval of f then it's

815
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,800
bounded by the soup of this function

816
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:06,280
plus that number right so I have that so

817
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,280
I have that

818
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,400
that's

819
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,400
[Applause]

820
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:30,200
So I have that the again the soup of f

821
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,200
on this little interval.

822
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:41,520
This is what we call m i of f.

823
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:45,599
that this is less or equal to because of

824
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,280
this inequality is less than the soup of

825
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,880
fn

826
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,880
of x on the same little interval

827
00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:03,520
plus epsilon over 3 b minus a right

828
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,720
and likewise likewise

829
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,720
so so likewise

830
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,880
for for the in.

831
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:21,760
So again I let little mi of f this is

832
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:25,640
now the infom

833
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,640
on this little interval

834
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:33,000
oops on this little interval of f right

835
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,960
sorry here here here I wanted to I

836
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:42,079
wanted to insert what this thing was so

837
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:49,000
this is m right I just the notation for

838
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,000
this soup here is m I FN

839
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,920
and uh the infreum the interim for f on

840
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,760
this little interval the notation for

841
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,880
that is that is is this little m i refer

842
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:11,200
to the interval f to the function

843
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:13,920
and so similarly if you take the uh

844
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:19,599
infom

845
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:23,200
infom So and you compare it to the infom

846
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:25,920
of this fn on the same interval

847
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,680
then the same

848
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,319
argument with obvious changes means that

849
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,720
m i

850
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:38,559
f here

851
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:42,000
is now bigger equal to

852
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,599
m i fn

853
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,960
minus

854
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:51,960
epsilon 1 over 3 B minus A.

855
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,960
Okay,

856
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,960
it's the same thing.

857
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,440
Okay, maybe I'll just explain it, but

858
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,280
it's the same sort of thing that you

859
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,240
take.

860
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, maybe I shouldn't erase this one.

861
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:10,720
So, it's a sort of the same thing that

862
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:19,599
you're looking at. You have f ofx

863
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:23,040
again uh is equal to fn of x plus uh fn

864
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:26,240
plus f of x minus right. So you have

865
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:30,640
obviously this.

866
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:36,000
And so this means that f ofx

867
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:38,640
is um is big or equal to

868
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,280
fn of x

869
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:45,280
minus. If you think that this here

870
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:48,160
becomes negative and the maximum it can

871
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:53,800
become negative on this little interval

872
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,800
here on uh this little interval

873
00:54:54,079 --> 00:55:01,040
the the worst this here can become

874
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:04,720
negative is epsilon over

875
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:10,079
uh actually for any interval is a is

876
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:12,079
this like that. So you always have this.

877
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,680
Okay.

878
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,440
And and so if you take now the infom on

879
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:24,079
this little interval then you're getting

880
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:26,240
m i f bigger equal to m i fn minus

881
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:29,839
epsilon

882
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,920
over 3 b minus a. Right? So you have

883
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:34,920
that. So that's what we claim over

884
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,920
there.

885
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:41,040
Okay. So, so we have we have this thing

886
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,680
here and we have the corresponding

887
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,760
thing. This is less or equal to the

888
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,599
maximum of the function on the same

889
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,520
interval.

890
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:54,400
And then that's and the uh and then this

891
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:59,040
equality here this equality here was

892
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:04,400
that it's bounded by this guy here plus

893
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:07,040
epsilon / 3 b minus a. Okay,

894
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:10,240
so this is for the little M's, the

895
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:13,680
little MIS and the capital MI. And now

896
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:17,760
we need to sum these guys and we need to

897
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:20,079
uh multiply those with a delta XI. So

898
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,960
this means that if you're looking at So

899
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:25,599
what we're interested in is we're

900
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,920
looking at this

901
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:32,240
times delta XI.

902
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:36,720
This gives you the the the sorry this

903
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,880
gives you the lower sum of f

904
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:43,720
with respect to this partition right

905
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,720
where you're summing here over the i

906
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:50,200
if you're summing

907
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,200
the soups

908
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:00,160
then you're getting the upper like

909
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:03,720
there, right?

910
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,720
And so now,

911
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:10,520
[Applause]

912
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,520
so you take

913
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:20,480
you take this equality, this inequality,

914
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:25,680
the string of inequality,

915
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,440
and you're just multiplying by delta

916
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,079
xi

917
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,559
on both sides

918
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:36,400
and then I'm summing right so if I

919
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:39,400
multiply so let's call this here star so

920
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,400
multiply

921
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,960
star

922
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:50,280
by delta xi

923
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,280
and sum

924
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,240
over

925
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:00,000
i right if you do that then what you get

926
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:03,000
is you're getting mi

927
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
fn

928
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:13,400
um

929
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:13,400
time minus epsilon over 3 b minus a

930
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,200
times

931
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:21,119
this time delta x i this is less or

932
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,880
equal to

933
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,520
m i

934
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:31,000
f delta xi

935
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:31,000
which is less or equal to this one here.

936
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,040
Sorry. And I should also sum

937
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:38,040
summing over I

938
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:43,280
like this.

939
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,960
And then I have one more inequality

940
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,359
namely this right hand side. Uh so less

941
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,640
or equal to

942
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:58,319
I'm summing over I

943
00:58:52,640 --> 00:59:05,119
uh and I have this is m i

944
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:11,799
f + epsilon over 3 b minus a

945
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:11,799
time delta x i. Okay,

946
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,680
so we have that. Now let's try to figure

947
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,680
out what this means.

948
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,010
[Applause]

949
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,040
So this here.

950
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,880
So now if you multiply this out

951
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:36,720
the first thing right the the the

952
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:39,839
top left corner that gives you when you

953
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:44,400
multiply the bracket out the first term

954
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:47,680
you get is the m I fn

955
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,599
times delta xi but that is just the

956
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,280
lower

957
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:56,640
sum with respect to the partition p for

958
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,280
fn Right?

959
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,000
But then you get an another term which

960
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:06,160
is you get one other term. you get this

961
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:14,839
minus and then you're summing over the i

962
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:14,839
of epsilon 3 b minus a * x i right

963
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:27,839
and then the then it's less or equal to

964
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:31,200
the same the the the term uh up there

965
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:34,160
that's just the lower sum

966
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:38,160
of f with respect to the partition. The

967
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:40,559
next term is the upper sum of f with

968
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,680
respect to the partition.

969
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,760
And then the last inequality, the first

970
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,040
term when you multiply this bracket out

971
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,400
the first term here is and unfortunately

972
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:56,640
there was a missing n

973
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:58,480
I copied it from here. Sorry,

974
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,280
there was a missing end. I just copied

975
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,280
from this one.

976
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:10,799
[Applause]

977
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:14,400
Right? So now when you multiply this

978
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:18,000
bracket out, the first term you get here

979
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,160
is um is so you're getting less or equal

980
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,400
to the first term you get there when

981
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,880
you're summing over the i. That's

982
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,720
exactly u

983
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,240
fn

984
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,920
p.

985
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:40,480
And then the second term you get is this

986
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:44,480
I epsilon over 3 B minus A delta X I

987
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:49,760
now this thing here

988
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:52,000
when I'm summing here right then uh I

989
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,559
this is just a constant so I can just

990
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,559
pull that constant out and the sum of

991
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:01,440
these differences that just give you B

992
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:03,760
minus A Right? So if you put that in and

993
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:08,720
this exactly the same you get on this

994
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:13,920
term then you have that L fn

995
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:18,799
P minus epsilon / 3

996
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:21,119
is uh is lesser equal to LF

997
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:27,280
uh P

998
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:30,799
and which is lesser equal to U FP

999
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:34,400
And this is less or equal to

1000
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:36,000
uh u fn

1001
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,599
p

1002
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,599
plus epsilon over three.

1003
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:48,480
Okay. Now what have we used so far? So

1004
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:51,920
far we have just used P was any

1005
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:55,200
partition and all we have to you all we

1006
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,160
have used is that the FN converts to F

1007
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,960
uniformly and then for this given

1008
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:05,520
epsilon we chose this capital N

1009
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:08,319
sufficiently large right

1010
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:13,200
but now

1011
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:16,079
now you see that now we can just fix so

1012
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,200
now we just Let

1013
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,359
uh little n we just set let this be

1014
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,440
equal to this capital n. Right? We just

1015
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:28,000
need to use it for one uh for one little

1016
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:32,240
n.

1017
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,039
And so but and then we can and now we

1018
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:38,079
have that since

1019
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:42,520
this particular function this one

1020
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,520
function was integraable

1021
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,160
then there exist a partition

1022
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,880
but this is now a partition that is

1023
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,359
that's comes from right it's determined

1024
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:02,240
from this function here but there exist

1025
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:07,119
a partition position so that so that the

1026
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:11,599
L uh sorry so that the difference

1027
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:14,319
between the difference between the upper

1028
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,480
sum

1029
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:22,920
for this function

1030
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,920
minus the lower sum for this function

1031
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:29,640
is less than say epsilon / 3. Okay.

1032
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:37,880
But so you see that

1033
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,880
this number here

1034
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:47,400
uh right so you see that the difference

1035
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,400
now I can erase this thing here.

1036
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,599
So now

1037
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,079
the first

1038
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:59,079
so we observe now

1039
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,079
that

1040
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,240
that this number here

1041
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,160
this number here because of this this

1042
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,319
this

1043
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,280
number is always larger than that.

1044
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:16,000
Right? And so this means that this thing

1045
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:19,280
here is u by this inequality it just

1046
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,920
tells you that this is less than that

1047
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:26,400
this thing here. Let me continue here

1048
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:29,119
below that this thing here is less than

1049
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,640
l fn

1050
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,000
p

1051
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,319
plus epsilon over three. This is coming

1052
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,400
from that this one here. Just moving

1053
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,720
this over on the other side. Then you

1054
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,559
have that this is bounded by that and

1055
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,559
then you have another epsilon over

1056
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,640
three.

1057
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:49,920
Fine.

1058
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:53,440
And so you see that those two things

1059
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:57,839
this here and that here is squeezed in

1060
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:59,520
an interval of length epsilon. Right? So

1061
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:02,720
it means that the difference between

1062
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:06,319
these two is is bounded by epsilon.

1063
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,640
Right? So, so

1064
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:13,440
LF

1065
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:18,400
with respect to this partition and U FP

1066
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,480
right they are in a in both lie

1067
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,119
both lie

1068
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,119
in an interval

1069
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,280
of length

1070
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:32,480
epsilon right so it means that the

1071
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:35,200
difference between the two right so the

1072
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,119
difference between so this here which is

1073
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,319
always positive

1074
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,720
but this here the difference must be

1075
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:45,880
less than less I guess less or equal to

1076
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,880
doesn't matter

1077
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:55,160
right okay so and this proves so this

1078
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:55,160
show right so this show

1079
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:03,839
that that f here is integraable

1080
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,839
it's integraable

1081
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,160
Right? Because to show that this

1082
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,319
function was integral, we just needed to

1083
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,640
for a given epsilon, we needed to find a

1084
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:18,079
partition so that the upper the

1085
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,559
difference between the upper and the

1086
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,160
lower sum was less or equal to epsilon.

1087
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:26,720
Right?

1088
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:30,400
So the function f is is is is

1089
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:38,240
uh is integraable. Now I claim that it

1090
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:44,440
also proves that um it also show that

1091
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:44,440
that the limit is what it should be

1092
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:58,559
right because you see that we now know

1093
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:01,799
we now know that the function so Now, so

1094
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,799
we have

1095
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,720
we have

1096
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,720
now

1097
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:15,280
that

1098
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:16,799
this integral of f dx this exist right

1099
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,359
because we prove that it's integral so

1100
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:21,600
it means that this exists and this is

1101
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,359
always squeezed

1102
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,520
between

1103
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:29,400
for any partition it's always squeezed

1104
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,400
between these two things,

1105
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:36,400
right?

1106
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:40,400
But now you see that so this means that

1107
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:43,600
that it would have to lie

1108
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:46,560
in this string of inequality.

1109
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:52,759
It would have to lie here between these

1110
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,759
two numbers. Right? But this thing here

1111
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,400
um you know if you make this right so we

1112
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:01,679
have also

1113
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:04,400
right so so what do we have

1114
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:07,960
we have that

1115
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,960
that so

1116
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:19,359
so we have that this integral here from

1117
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:25,120
a to b of f dx is less less or equal to

1118
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:27,279
u f with respect to any partition.

1119
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:32,799
Same thing here.

1120
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:36,719
And now if we if we um right if we let

1121
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:39,520
the if we looked at if we used this uh

1122
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:42,719
if we we used that for this given

1123
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,920
epsilon that n here was bigger than

1124
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:49,040
capital n big or equal to

1125
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:55,520
then we have that this thing here was

1126
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:57,280
bounded below from this inequality l fn

1127
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,800
p minus

1128
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,960
uh epsilon / 3

1129
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,960
and we had that it was bounded from

1130
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,960
above. So this is just this inequality u

1131
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:13,679
fn

1132
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:16,320
p plus epsilon / 3 and so now we we made

1133
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,560
use of and so we do this for this

1134
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:23,360
capital n.

1135
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:27,760
So in particular it holds for capital n.

1136
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:30,000
And now we made use of that. Uh so now

1137
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:33,040
all I want to do is here I want to

1138
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,920
estimate the difference between this

1139
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:39,679
integral here

1140
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:47,560
uh and this integral here and the

1141
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:47,560
integral from a to b of f uh capital n.

1142
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,960
Right? And I want to prove that if I'm

1143
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,480
very far out this this here is very

1144
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:00,400
small right but I now make this one

1145
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:04,000
here. So if I take if I when I choose my

1146
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:06,320
partition so that this number here so

1147
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,560
then I can just make sure that this

1148
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,400
number here when I

1149
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:14,800
prove the when I uh choose the partition

1150
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:18,000
then I just said that I choose the

1151
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:21,280
partition so that this thing here

1152
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:24,400
minus this lower here

1153
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:27,679
for this capital n that this here was

1154
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:30,719
smaller than epsilon over two. Right?

1155
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:35,199
And so this means again but now you see

1156
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:38,880
that um this integral

1157
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:40,880
of this integral here this is always

1158
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,280
squeezed between these two numbers. So

1159
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,280
this is always

1160
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,440
squeezed like this.

1161
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,440
Right?

1162
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:05,440
And so now you see that this means that

1163
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:08,000
um that this integral is in this

1164
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:13,120
interval here.

1165
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,080
Uh but in fact um

1166
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:20,040
in fact of course in this interval

1167
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,040
between these two numbers

1168
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,120
between actually the these two numbers

1169
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:29,199
by by you know even if there wasn't a

1170
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:32,560
plus in that interval that uh this

1171
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:34,239
integral here would also lie right so it

1172
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,560
lies

1173
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:39,199
even more comfortable in this larger

1174
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:43,120
interval where you adding epsilon over 3

1175
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:46,800
and subtracting epsilon over 3. So, so

1176
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:52,120
this integral lie between these two the

1177
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:52,120
same is the case for this

1178
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,080
and this interval again have length

1179
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,400
epsilon. So this means that this

1180
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:04,360
difference between these two number is

1181
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,360
also less than epsilon

1182
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,640
right

1183
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,199
and so this really proved that if it was

1184
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,440
sufficiently far out then the difference

1185
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:20,320
between these two integral was bounded

1186
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:25,199
by epsilon right so this this prove that

1187
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:28,560
the integral are converging okay

1188
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:32,000
let's look at So how do we use this? So

1189
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:34,560
what we were interested in was uh using

1190
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,280
this fact

1191
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,679
uh in the case of a power series. So let

1192
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:44,199
me just

1193
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,199
look at an example for that.

1194
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:54,000
So suppose that en of x so this is the

1195
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:58,480
same as in the previous example

1196
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:03,679
um where I'm summing here from k =0 to n

1197
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:07,920
xn over x k sorry over k factorial right

1198
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:12,400
so these are the function xn and x is

1199
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:14,320
just sorry e en and and the function um

1200
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,640
to this is the function Here the

1201
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,600
function e is just the exponential

1202
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,120
function. So which I think about as the

1203
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,880
infinite

1204
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:28,000
uh series the power series

1205
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:31,760
like this.

1206
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:38,360
And now I had so we already observe that

1207
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:38,360
by the bio stress uh so by bio stress

1208
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:48,800
M test

1209
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:52,159
uh uh by V size M test the EN

1210
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:55,880
converts to E

1211
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,880
on any interval

1212
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,840
you have to restrict the interval.

1213
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,679
But if you're fixing an interval like

1214
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:10,000
this then it's converging uh uniformly

1215
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:15,520
right so this is what bio size m game

1216
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:18,080
right and now these functions here they

1217
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:21,360
are polomials the en are polinomials so

1218
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:26,640
it's easy to integrate them so you have

1219
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:30,320
that that the integral here of en

1220
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:34,880
dx x from uh let's say some interval

1221
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:38,480
from a to b. This thing here is now uh

1222
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,239
equal to the sum here. So you can so now

1223
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,159
it's just a finite sum. So you can

1224
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:47,199
exchange that and then you're

1225
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:50,199
integrating from a to b of x k over k

1226
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,199
factorial.

1227
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,640
And of course that's very easy to do,

1228
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,679
right?

1229
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:02,719
uh so dx

1230
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:06,480
and and the theorem with that we just

1231
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:09,679
proved that this thing here is because

1232
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:12,080
the convergence is uniform each of these

1233
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:16,480
is integraable. This means that the

1234
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:19,120
limit here is also uh integraable and

1235
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:22,880
the integral of

1236
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:25,920
of the exponential function

1237
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,719
is the limit of these integrals

1238
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,199
right and so this the point here is

1239
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:34,400
again is that

1240
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:36,960
um if you have uniform convergence then

1241
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:39,280
you can sort of I mean you're using the

1242
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:43,600
uniform convergence that we have from

1243
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:47,920
bias size M test then we can interchange

1244
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:50,920
this infinite sum with taking integrals.

1245
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,920
Okay,

1246
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,560
let me just I I I I had wanted to do one

1247
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:02,480
more thing but I

1248
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,560
I don't have time to do that quite uh so

1249
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,120
I I'll pick up on that next time but let

1250
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,360
me just observe

1251
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:12,159
that when you're integrating here when

1252
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,640
you're integrating this this thing here

1253
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:17,199
right so what is the integral of this so

1254
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:21,120
when we're just calculating this so

1255
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:23,760
you're integrating uh x to the k over k

1256
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:26,960
factorial. When you're integrating a

1257
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,400
polomial, you're looking for you're

1258
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,120
using the fundamental theorem of

1259
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:33,360
calculus. So you're trying to look for a

1260
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,760
function whose derivative is this,

1261
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,840
right? Such a function is often called

1262
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:41,040
the anti-derivative.

1263
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:45,360
And so what is that function? So a

1264
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:49,040
function so if you're looking at x to

1265
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:50,560
the power k + one right so you know that

1266
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,560
you have to because it's a polinomial

1267
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:58,640
you have to add one right to the

1268
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:01,440
exponent and then this as when you take

1269
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,600
derivative this come down so you have to

1270
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:06,880
look at

1271
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,679
k + one factorial right because if you

1272
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,600
take when you take the derivative then k

1273
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:15,600
plus one come down and it kills the

1274
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:18,400
first one and the rest is this right

1275
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:21,040
and so so when you evaluate this

1276
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,880
integral then it's this here is the

1277
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:25,520
anti-derivative

1278
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,360
and you have to ex

1279
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,480
uh insert

1280
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:34,400
the boundary values like this right so

1281
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:38,000
that would be the integral

1282
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:40,960
okay so I'll just stop here and next

1283
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,199
time I'll go through the one theorem I

1284
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:48,080
didn't get to which is how to

1285
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:50,880
interchange the differentiation and uh

1286
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,600
and uh right if you take a sequence of

1287
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:57,040
functions that converge uniformly and

1288
01:18:53,600 --> 01:19:00,000
you want to take the derivative of these

1289
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,800
um how do you relate the derivative of

1290
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,440
the sequence to derivative of the limit

1291
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,440
okay so but it's in the notes I already

1292
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,679
posted the notes but I'll go through

1293
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,679
that next Any

1294
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:14,679
questions?

1295
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,679
>> Yeah.

1296
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,280
>> Yeah.

1297
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:29,120
>> Yeah.

1298
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:33,040
>> That's okay. Right. Because um right so

1299
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,920
I um I'm not 100% sure I I needed

1300
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,360
epsilon less or equal to epsilon. It

1301
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,800
doesn't really matter, right? because

1302
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:42,719
you just picked that I I had chosen it

1303
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,080
uh with the epsilon over three and

1304
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:49,440
epsilon over three

1305
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:51,600
* b minus a that was just to have it

1306
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,520
worked out. So it was epsilon in the end

1307
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,199
but you could of course have chosen it

1308
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,080
even smaller than you would have had

1309
01:19:55,199 --> 01:20:02,719
strict inequality. It's possible it was

1310
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,719
actually strict inequality anyway.
