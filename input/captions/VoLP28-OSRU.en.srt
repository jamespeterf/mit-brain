1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,880
okay so today what we're going to do is

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,039
uh talk about health economics um I

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,439
essentially this is sort of really just

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,000
an applied lecture where I want to talk

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,000
about a particular policy topic and

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,199
throw in along the way what we've

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,399
learned in this course that informs you

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,399
think about that topic so this just an

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,920
example of how you can take the set of

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,920
things we learn the semester and help

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,520
understand really one of the one of the

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
two or three most fundamental public

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,960
policy issues of our time and also the

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
one I happen to work on so uh the one

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,440
that I find particularly important uh

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,160
and appealing okay so let's set the

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,399
stage talk about Healthcare economics by

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,760
talk about Healthcare in the US and

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,920
let's just throw out a couple of facts

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,840
the US in

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,880
1950 spent 4% of our GDP in 1950 we

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,920
spent 4% of our GDP on Healthcare that

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,240
was that's pretty big that's a 25th of

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,159
the economy but it was you know the 10th

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:19,040
biggest sector of the economy

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,520
today we spend more than 18% of our GDP

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
on Healthcare it's the largest single

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,960
sector of the US

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:31,600
economy okay so we have the spending on

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,600
healthc care has grown enormously

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:40,840
now do you have to the question is um

32
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:43,360
has it been worth it both overall and

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,079
distributionally so overall if we want

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,280
to think about how it's been worth it we

35
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,640
can't look at many people look at these

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,040
numbers say oh my God we've got a crisis

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
well that number does not tell you

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,560
there's a

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,680
crisis okay what we care about is what

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,039
has been the benefit and cost of this

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,560
growth in healthcare

42
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,360
spending okay maybe this number was just

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,880
disturbingly low and this is the maybe

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,399
this number is still too low maybe we're

45
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,119
not at the right level you can't look at

46
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,640
these big numbers and this is sort of

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,959
how we want to you to think coming out

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,440
of this class is to not have the

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,280
knee-jerk reaction you'll do and say oh

50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,440
my God we have a crisis think well do we

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,440
have a crisis it's been worth it and the

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,040
answer to that is

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,680
mixed on the one

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,280
hand if you look at the overall average

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,200
health of the US the growth and spending

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,800
has been worth it that is as I've

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,000
referred to a few times in this class

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,319
economists have methods for trying to

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,280
Value Health improvements trying to

60
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,720
Value life I talk about them more in

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,560
1441 we'll get the methodology now but

62
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,760
we have methodology putting a value on

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,239
extending life a value on improving

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,800
health and by those estimates it's been

65
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,519
massively worth it healthc care sucked

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,480
in 1950 babies who are born prematurely

67
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,040
we're four times as likely to die okay I

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,319
have a friend just had a baby eight

69
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,159
weeks prematur at four pounds that baby

70
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,720
would have been dead in 1950 they just

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,959
went home today the baby's perfectly

72
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,440
healthy okay if you had a heart attack

73
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,519
in 1950 chances were you were going to

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,920
die today you'll live four times many

75
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,720
people live after heart attacks today as

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,000
they did in 1950 the odds are four times

77
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,280
higher or you guys aren't having babies

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,319
or having heart attacks it's a relevant

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,519
number okay how many skiers do we have

80
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,400
here okay if you were skiing in 1950 and

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,120
you crashed and tore your ACL or or or

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,720
spraying your your MCL or one of those

83
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,000
things okay you're in the hospital for a

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,519
week you're on crutches for six weeks

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,439
and you arthritis the rest of your life

86
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,159
today you get arthoscopic outpatient

87
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,159
surgery within a day you go home that

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,159
night and you're back on the slopes

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,760
within a few weeks okay healthc care is

90
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,000
just much much better and if you look at

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,319
a typical value of how Economist value

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,360
improved Health it has been worth it we

93
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,360
are better off as a nation

94
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,760
spending 18% of GDP on healthare today

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,360
than we were spending 4% in 1950 but

96
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,760
there's another way to test that what's

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,920
the other way economists would say if

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,680
someone says well we're worse off today

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,519
how would an economist challenge

100
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:21,600
them how could you prove that people

101
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:24,240
don't want 1950s Healthcare 1950s prices

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,280
yeah no one's demanding 1950s Healthcare

103
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,880
at 1950s prices no one's out there

104
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,720
saying oh yeah I want crap happy

105
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,919
healthare for low prices it's sort of

106
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,639
the opposite of the airline example

107
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,199
remember with Airlines we talked about

108
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,840
people about service but the truth

109
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,280
is if it was really a problem there'd be

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,400
expensive High service Airlines which

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
there aren't okay it's the same thing

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,560
with

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,960
Healthcare so Fact one is we spend a lot

114
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,120
more Fact Two is overall it's been worth

115
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,560
it fact three is the distributional

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,000
consequences have been very bad so the

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,880
other fact the reason people'll say us

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
Healthcare is bad you'll hear facts like

119
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,400
we are the most expensive by the way 18

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,400
% plus we are on average about a third

121
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,039
relative to what unit space based on our

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,840
income richer countries spend more on

123
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:12,800
Healthcare it is a luxury good as your

124
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,400
income goes up you spend more of your

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,520
income on improving your

126
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,840
health okay it's a luxury good the

127
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,600
income eless is greater than one so

128
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,360
richer countries do spend a higher share

129
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,160
of the CHP in healthcare but if you draw

130
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,639
a line we're way off that line we spent

131
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,080
about a third more than you'd expect or

132
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,360
other way put is Rel to other countries

133
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,039
at our income love we spent about a

134
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,680
third more than You' expect and if you

135
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,759
look at overall outcomes despite the

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,160
fact I just told you about how we're

137
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,720
healthy overall since

138
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,840
1950 today our outcomes on International

139
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
standards are

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,520
terrible we are about 16th in the world

141
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,160
in infant mortality on any measure of

142
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,479
sort of Health outcomes we look terrible

143
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,360
other other countries so we spend a

144
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,360
third more than we

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,680
predict based on our income we have

146
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
outcomes interntional comparison that

147
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,520
are terrible well how's that consistent

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,919
with the facts I just said that's worth

149
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,680
it it's consistent because the the

150
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,039
outcomes that we point to are driven by

151
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,360
the bottom of our society which is not

152
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,720
true in other countries a white baby

153
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,880
born in America today has the same

154
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,599
chance of seeing their first birthday

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,440
it's a white baby born in Europe a black

156
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,639
baby born in America today has a lower

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,479
chance than a black baby born in

158
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,880
Barbados okay we basically and I talked

159
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,039
about we talked the inequality lecture

160
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,759
about those neighborhoods three miles

161
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,960
apart Freddy Gray's neighborhood versus

162
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,520
the rich neighborhood a 17-year

163
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,759
differential life expectancy the bad

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,120
outcomes in the US are not relevant for

165
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,520
the people in this room for the people

166
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,160
in this room the US is where you want to

167
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,479
be for healthcare in terms of

168
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,840
outcomes what's the way economists would

169
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,840
test

170
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,960
that what's would prove that for those

171
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,759
who are in the system the US is the best

172
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,800
place to be

173
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,960
well every year about 1 million people

174
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,560
come to America at Medical Care no one

175
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,759
leaves they might go to k keeper drugs

176
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,520
but no one's flying to France for

177
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,720
surgery they fly to America once again

178
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,919
that's how economists think about

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,680
testing hypothesis we look at the data

180
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,759
the real preference is for those who are

181
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,800
in the system we have the best

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,039
Healthcare in the world the reason our

183
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,000
outcome is so terrible of to other

184
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,720
countries is we have taale outcomes

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,479
other countries don't have and that's

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
about access and

187
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,400
Equity so the bottom line is where we

188
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,599
stand today a system that's

189
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,080
expensive that delivers flows in the

190
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
system as good outcomes as other places

191
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,759
but it's highly

192
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,080
inequitable last point I did say a white

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,599
baby born America day is the same

194
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,120
chaning their first birthday as one born

195
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,879
in Europe but not a not a 50% better

196
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,599
chance even though we spend 50% more in

197
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,960
healthcare so while we spend 18% and

198
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,560
it's been worth it we still may waste a

199
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,879
lot the fact that it's worth at 18%

200
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
doesn't mean we couldn't have equally

201
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,319
good outcomes at 12 or 13% it doesn't

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,440
mean we're on the efficient Frontier it

203
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,759
doesn't mean producing Healthcare

204
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,280
efficiently in other words there were so

205
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,479
many good opportunities to improve

206
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,919
health that even though we might be

207
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,159
wasting money we're still better off

208
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,919
spending it and that's the key Point

209
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,039
remember to avoid one lesson from this

210
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,800
course is let's avoid extreme thinking

211
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,240
if you have a something that's wasteful

212
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,720
it doesn't mean it wasn't worth doing

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,759
you've got to compare the benefits in

214
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,919
the cost we are probably and I'll come

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,319
back to this relative to the efficient

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,800
Frontier wasting a lot of money we can

217
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,599
produce the same Healthcare outcomes in

218
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,760
the US for a lot less money that doesn't

219
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,519
mean we're worse off today than we used

220
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:43,959
to be it just means we could be even

221
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:47,560
better okay questions about any of

222
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:49,200
that now what I want to do then is focus

223
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,839
on two topics

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,560
today the first topic is the fairness

225
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,560
topic and that revolves around insurance

226
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,320
coverage so I want to talk about the

227
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,079
fact the US is the only developed nation

228
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,959
in the world without Universal coverage

229
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:02,959
buing

230
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,399
insurance and what we're doing about it

231
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,040
the second topic is what do we do about

232
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,800
the fact that we spend much more on

233
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,399
Healthcare to other countries that have

234
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,640
better or at least comparable outcomes

235
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,040
to ours so let's talk about the first

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,720
topic the US is the only country in the

237
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,200
world where citizens face the risk of

238
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,480
being uninsured so I want you to cast

239
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,519
your mind back to when you were little

240
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,160
kids before

241
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,760
2010 okay before the Affordable Care Act

242
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,839
the way the US looked in

243
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,160
2009 was about 60% of

244
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,959
Americans had employer sponsored

245
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,440
insurance they had insured through their

246
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,800
employer like I have through

247
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,600
MIT about 20% of

248
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,000
Americans had public

249
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,040
Insurance okay that's insurance through

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,040
two programs

251
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,680
Medicare Medicare which is in Universal

252
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,440
coverage for the elderly so do have

253
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,440
Universal coverage Once you turn 65 and

254
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,800
Medicaid which is Health insures

255
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,160
coverage for the poor so we had public

256
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,040
coverage entitlement but only if you

257
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,480
were poor or

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,480
elderly okay the other

259
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,680
20%

260
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:28,200
okay why because remember what I talked

261
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,880
about insurance market equilibrium okay

262
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,880
I talk Insurance market equilibrium I

263
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,040
said give an adverse selection several

264
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,959
things can

265
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,200
happen Okay and the thing that is going

266
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
to happen now I don't know what they

267
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,800
could do with that on the video they

268
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,480
bleep my swears I guess they G have to

269
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,560
like like sorry I'll just I'll erase

270
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,959
that because I'm GNA be in trouble on

271
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,920
the

272
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:51,600
video they'll just they'll have to like

273
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,480
white it out or something um so um I am

274
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,839
I am I'll have you know proudly I'm the

275
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,440
most Bleak professor at MIT so um at

276
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,720
least who has videos online um so

277
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,120
um what we have a situation with with

278
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,720
other 20% of people the insurance Market

279
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,880
is broken if you work for a big employer

280
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,000
the insurance Market Works remember we

281
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,880
learned our insurance lecture people

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,399
want to be insured that's optimal they

283
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,560
want to smooth their consumption across

284
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,880
States if you work for a big employer

285
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,959
like MIT it works MIT offers me

286
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,760
insurance they offer that insurance at

287
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,519
basically a pretty fair rate given the

288
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,920
health risk of people at

289
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,680
MIT okay and I buy it and MIT subsidizes

290
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,839
it for to help me buy it if you public

291
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,399
insurance is typically free or low cost

292
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,279
for everyone else if you want an insur

293
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
to walk in insurance company and say I

294
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,959
want Insurance they're like whoa why do

295
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,160
you want Insurance you must be sick if

296
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,000
you want insurance I'm going to test the

297
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,959
Wazoo out of you deny you if you're at

298
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,200
all sick if you're not sick I'll offer

299
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,680
you insurance but if you get sick I'm

300
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,160
going to drop you so essentially there

301
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,360
was no insurance essentially the rest of

302
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,079
this 20% of the population had no access

303
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,480
to insurance and we know that's a huge

304
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,160
market failure we know that people are

305
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,000
much worse off uninsured than

306
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,000
insured we had about 50 million American

307
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,320
about the majority of this number were

308
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,680
uninsured and about another four to

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
five% of

310
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,120
Americans uh were uh about 15% of

311
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,760
Americans were uninsured about 45% of

312
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,880
Americans were buying Insurance because

313
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,959
they were the healthy ones who could get

314
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,600
in the market and buy

315
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:30,079
it so what did we propose to do about

316
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,240
this well we proposed to do

317
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,399
was first proposed here so um by

318
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,760
Governor Mitt Romney a Republican and

319
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,839
then eventually picked up by President

320
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,079
Obama democrat was to propose what I

321
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,639
call a three-legged stool solution to

322
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,279
this problem I actually wrote a comic

323
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,040
book to explain this uh it's called a

324
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,680
graphic novel but it's a comic book uh

325
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,680
ambitiously entitled Healthcare reform

326
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,000
um it's like nine bucks on Amazon and uh

327
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,600
to try to explain this I think of

328
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,360
graphic images about how we think about

329
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,160
this law and I think it's a three-leg

330
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
stool leg one is to say insurers you can

331
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,240
no longer

332
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,600
discriminate anyone of a given age you

333
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,199
could charge old people more than young

334
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,720
people within reason and you could

335
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,040
charge people in an expensive area more

336
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,320
than a less expensive area within reason

337
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,240
but for a given age and a given area if

338
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,959
I come in coughing and hacking and sick

339
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,040
you cannot charge me more than someone

340
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,399
who comes in running having run in and

341
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,240
looks healthy okay you can no longer

342
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,639
discriminate you can't charge women more

343
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,120
than men for health insurance which they

344
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,480
did you can't charge sick people more

345
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,160
more than healthy for health

346
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,880
insurance

347
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,600
okay but we realized that alone would

348
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,120
not work and in fact we had evidence why

349
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,920
that wouldn't work because in the 19907

350
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,160
States including Massachusetts tried to

351
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,320
do that they passed laws which said for

352
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,639
those will leave these people alone but

353
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,760
for there remaining of people the people

354
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,440
have to buy in what we call the

355
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,440
non-group

356
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,440
Market the people left to buy in the

357
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,560
non-group market okay for those people

358
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,759
okay we going to say insurers can't

359
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,480
discriminate what do you think happened

360
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,920
so think of yourself as an insurer

361
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,279
you're the guy like I set you up selling

362
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,440
Insurance to MIT students you suffer a

363
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,279
massive adverse election or that risk

364
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,519
and I tell you you can't

365
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,360
discriminate what do you

366
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,079
do you quit you say well forget it the

367
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
Market's gonna fail if you're G to tell

368
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,800
me I can't discriminate I'm not going to

369
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,720
make money because I know I'm going to

370
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,759
get selected against so I'm just going

371
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,680
to bag and that's what happened the

372
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,839
insurance markets collapsed

373
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,000
in all these states which is you can't

374
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,880
regulatorily enforce a pooling

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,639
equilibrium by just saying you should

376
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,000
have to charge everyone the same that

377
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,120
doesn't work if only the sick buy so the

378
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440
market

379
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,240
collapsed so that's why I realize we

380
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
need the second leg of the stool and by

381
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,759
we I do actually mean we like I work

382
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,399
with Governor Romney on this uh and help

383
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,839
design this program okay we as we need a

384
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,680
second leg of the stool which was a

385
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,120
mandate that individuals buy health

386
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,680
insurance which was to say look if if

387
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,959
we're going to tell insurers they have

388
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,680
to charge the pooling price then we got

389
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,120
to enforce the pool and the way you

390
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,320
enforce the pool is a mandate so an

391
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,399
individual it's called an individual

392
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,560
mandate requirement that people buy

393
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,720
health insurance or they have to pay a

394
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,399
big

395
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,839
fine okay so that was the second leg of

396
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,959
this tool say we're going to have a fair

397
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,240
prices insurers be able to offer a

398
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,040
pooling price because they know what the

399
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,440
average price is going to be because

400
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,399
everyone's going to buy but that laid a

401
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,800
third problem in 2004 before we were

402
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,360
writing this law the average family

403
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,519
health insurance plan was

404
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,199
$122,000 and the US poverty

405
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,519
line that the family plan and the US

406
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,839
poverty line for a family of four was

407
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,480
about

408
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,800
$188,000 you can't mandate a family pay

409
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
two-thirds of their income for health

410
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,399
insurance that's both INF feasable and

411
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,759
bad

412
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,680
politics so we need the Third Leg of the

413
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,839
stool which was subsidies we need to

414
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,880
make health insurance affordable for the

415
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,720
lower income groups

416
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,680
so the pool was the three legs of the

417
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,440
stool were no

418
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:11,560
discrimination or what we call an in in

419
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,560
health insurance terms Community

420
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,079
rating which means you have to charge

421
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,680
everyone the same

422
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:24,000
thing that matched with the

423
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,000
Mandate was the second leg matched with

424
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
subsidies

425
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,759
okay to basically make it

426
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,279
affordable so essentially the idea was

427
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,120
by doing all three things at once you

428
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,880
make health insurance affordable for

429
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,959
low-income people we set up a program

430
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,720
called Commonwealth Care remember I

431
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,720
talked about the poverty line in our

432
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,519
lecture on inequality we said anyone who

433
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,240
lived below three times the poverty line

434
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,560
we would heavily subsidize their health

435
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,279
insurance to make it

436
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,240
affordable then we said make it

437
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,720
affordable we're going to make you buy

438
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
it we're not make it it free make it

439
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,480
affordable we set have a slide what's

440
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,560
called a sliding income scale scale you

441
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,680
had to pay a certain percent of your

442
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,280
income to get health insurance we have

443
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,520
sliding income scale we're going to make

444
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,160
it affordable we're going to make

445
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,839
everyone buy it and make insurers offer

446
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,319
insurance with no discrimination offer

447
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,520
Community rating and we passed that law

448
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,480
in

449
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,360
2005 okay what happened 20 God now my

450
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,919
dates are bad was it 2006 I don't even

451
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,039
remember getting old anyway 2005 2006 I

452
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:27,799
don't remember um what

453
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:29,480
happened was uh an enormous success now

454
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,320
you won't find any more any more biased

455
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,760
than me okay on this topic but I think

456
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,840
it's hard to argu as anything but a

457
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,200
success how would you measure success

458
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,360
first of all was it popular yes it never

459
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,840
had below 60% public support Second of

460
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,400
all did it achieve its goals what were

461
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,840
its two goals the first goal was

462
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,360
covering uninsured people the mass

463
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,000
uninsurance rate fell fell by 2third

464
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,640
bring the insurance rate to 3% in

465
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,840
Massachusetts which is lower than which

466
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,400
is as low as many countries in Europe

467
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,559
that was a success

468
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,559
the third Al was did it fix the broken

469
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,720
non-group Market the market we' broken

470
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,360
by just trying to do this alone we tried

471
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,360
to this alone first and broke the market

472
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,440
and the answer is it did fix it many new

473
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,440
insurers came in prices came down

474
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,480
50% so what you had at the end of the

475
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,760
day after this was a state where anyone

476
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,640
regardless of Health could get fairly

477
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,039
priced health insurance subsidized if

478
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,039
they couldn't afford

479
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:29,200
it so this was viewed as a huge success

480
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,520
let me say on the right and the left

481
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
okay if I can develop into politics a

482
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,880
little bit because I'm personally

483
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,320
personally upset about this okay this

484
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,840
was a law signed by a republican

485
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,200
Governor the speaker at the event where

486
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,039
they signed it the main speaker on the

487
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,240
podium was a conservative someone for

488
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,600
conservative think tank this was viewed

489
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,720
as a victory for individual

490
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,840
responsibility conservatives praise

491
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,000
individual responsibility we're going to

492
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,960
make people take responsibility for

493
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,919
their own Healthcare by having this

494
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,440
individual mandate and indeed it was so

495
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,440
successful that many other states wanted

496
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,159
to replicate it probably my favorite

497
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,000
experience this was getting to work in

498
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,520
California now as a child of 80s action

499
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,559
movies getting to work person with

500
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,159
Governor Schwarzenegger was pretty cool

501
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,039
indeed in the anti room before you meet

502
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,480
him I he has the sword from Conan the

503
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,840
Barbarian so I got to hold I have a

504
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,760
picture holding the sword from Conan

505
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,320
which was really cool and Schwarzenegger

506
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,880
really does he says we must cover all

507
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,880
the uninsured in California you know it

508
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,080
really sounds like that and uh that was

509
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,840
very cool and I work with California

510
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,039
other states and we'd get almost the

511
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,559
finish line and then every time they'd

512
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,320
say wait a second how are we going to

513
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,880
pay for this this is really expensive in

514
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,120
massach since it turned out we had sort

515
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,480
of a cheat which is we were already

516
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,640
spending a lot of money uninsured we

517
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,679
could just

518
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,280
rededicate other states didn't have that

519
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,440
benefit so every state when they got to

520
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,440
finish line we're like yeah sounds good

521
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,960
in theory we can't afford it they

522
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,360
stopped and we realized that if you're

523
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,200
were going to do this nationally there

524
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,240
had to be a national source of financing

525
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,159
and that's what led President Obama to

526
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,320
propose the Affordable Care Act

527
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,000
Affordable Care Act was basically the

528
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,400
Massachusetts law with three more zeros

529
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,559
it's basically the national massach law

530
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,600
at the federal level what do the foral

531
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,880
Care Act do it opposes Community rating

532
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,840
and

533
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,360
insurance okay it mandates mandated

534
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,280
individuals to have health

535
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,000
insurance and it set up subsidies to

536
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,320
make that health insurance

537
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,400
affordable in particular subsidized in

538
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,360
two ways one is it expanded the Medicaid

539
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,640
Program the Medicaid Program used to be

540
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
only for very very poor people people

541
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,679
living below like a quarter of the

542
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,960
poverty line like super poor people now

543
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,320
it's available to everyone up to 133% of

544
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,640
the poverty line so like $30,000 for a

545
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,559
family still poor but many more people

546
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,520
and we set up subsidies like in

547
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,960
Massachusetts for those who were above

548
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,080
133% of the poverty line but below four

549
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,200
times the poverty line so it's like a

550
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,400
three- tier system if you're below 133%

551
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,679
of the poverty line insurance is free

552
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,159
from 133 to four times the poverty line

553
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,039
we're going to subsize Insurance on a

554
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,679
sliding scale and then above four times

555
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:56,280
the poverty line you're on your own but

556
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,880
we did one other thing which we set up

557
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,360
exchanges so people could easily find

558
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,679
and shop for insurance so they could go

559
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,280
into the exchange we said the state

560
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,120
exchang could easily find and shop for

561
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,400
their insurance using these subsidies to

562
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,480
buy health

563
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,159
insurance okay and that's basically what

564
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,240
the Affordable Care Act did now um let's

565
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,600
talk about the Affordable Care Act on

566
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,360
policy front it was an enormous success

567
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,840
within several years of the law was

568
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,480
passed in

569
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,640
2010 implemented in

570
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,240
2014 by 2016 we covered about 20 million

571
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,600
Americans with health insurance

572
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,240
coverage okay which was and we had fixed

573
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,799
discrimination there was no longer

574
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,240
discrimination Insurance markets I

575
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:41,039
cannot emphasize this enough people do

576
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,120
not talk about this enough with that

577
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,799
with the foral Care Act they talk about

578
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,720
its effects on costs or coverage they

579
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,080
don't talk about the most important part

580
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,320
of the phal Care Act which is the US is

581
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,240
no longer a nation where you can be

582
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,799
denied Insurance because you're sick

583
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,200
it's no longer a nation where women get

584
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:58,600
charged more for insurance than men it's

585
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,000
and these this is these are critical

586
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,159
change every other nation in the world

587
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,600
has this principle no other nation in

588
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:04,080
the world allowed Insurance to

589
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,840
discriminate the discriminate the way we

590
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,320
did and that ended so in policy grounds

591
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,720
enormous success politically massive

592
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,880
failure why why massive failure well

593
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,320
books have been written and we'll

594
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,799
continue written on

595
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:23,279
this I think a couple of interesting

596
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,559
lessons one lesson is you know we don't

597
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,720
talk in this class about political

598
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,240
economy which is the study of how voters

599
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,480
make their decisions and how politicians

600
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,039
make their decisions but if you go back

601
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,039
to these numbers the idea of both the

602
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,520
massachusett bill and the Affordable

603
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:41,039
Care Act was look for 80% of people the

604
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,480
system's working let's leave them alone

605
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,159
let's focus on 20% it's not working

606
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,360
for in mass that work great because 80%

607
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,559
said hey look I don't care and you're

608
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,559
helping uninsured people great I'll

609
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:53,600
support it

610
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,960
nationally we had the problem that there

611
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,279
are many people out there saying this

612
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,640
law was terrible and the 80% said wait a

613
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:02,400
second maybe this Turbo's not doing

614
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,960
anything for me so may his law isn't so

615
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,320
great so the conversation was changed in

616
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,279
a away wasn't in

617
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,440
Massachusetts so essentially by leaving

618
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,480
80% of people alone the theory was gee

619
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,840
they'll at best at worst be neutral at

620
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,120
best be supportive because they we doing

621
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,480
good things we missed the fact that they

622
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,880
were up to being

623
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,360
persuaded and they're easily persuaded

624
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,520
because of these important numbers if

625
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,240
you pass a law in 2010 and don't

626
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,600
Implement till 2014 you give four years

627
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,400
people don't like the law talk about how

628
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,679
terrible it is with nothing to point to

629
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,000
so for four years people said this could

630
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,440
to be disaster it's destroying the US

631
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,200
economy D D D D D and all the supporters

632
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,960
says well wait after 2014 things will be

633
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,200
better but by then opinions had kind of

634
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,720
hardened so it's interesting lessons

635
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:54,039
politics what's the economics of

636
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:57,240
this the economics of this is that

637
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,919
basically when that in some sense when

638
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,679
thinking about optimal policy polic

639
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,799
design politics is another

640
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,679
constraint that we can't just as

641
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,360
economists and policiers say well I

642
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,720
studed 1401 here's the optimal policy we

643
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,360
have to recognize that optimal policy is

644
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,559
constrained by what politicians want to

645
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,200
do and voters want and that's okay that

646
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,480
just means that when you optimize

647
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,760
there's another constraint in

648
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,080
optimization which is recognizing that

649
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,240
you need to think about the real world

650
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,640
political

651
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,559
consequences of uh decisions you make

652
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,520
like delaying for years pass to have the

653
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:36,880
law take effect or like doing nothing

654
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,240
for these 80% of the public Etc now a

655
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,799
funny thing happened in 2016 well not a

656
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,960
funny thing happened first in 2016

657
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,120
partly as a result of this the

658
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
Republicans took over both the

659
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,480
presidency both sides of the Congress

660
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,159
and their number one policy platform was

661
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,880
repealing the Affordable Care

662
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,159
Act and so we pretty much figured all

663
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,159
the supporters figured well it's been a

664
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,480
good run but it's over now but then a

665
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,080
funny thing happened by the time 2017

666
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,760
rolled around the law in place for a few

667
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,399
years and people were like gee this law

668
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,799
isn't so bad we kind of like it we don't

669
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:06,960
want to go away and so actually repeal

670
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,440
never

671
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,440
happened so in in fact in 2017 support

672
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,720
went above water went above 50% for the

673
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,440
first time and the law was not repealed

674
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,159
and now will not be repealed president

675
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,679
you know candidate Trump has talked

676
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,399
recently about wanting to repal the law

677
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,080
repeal the law again it's going to be

678
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:25,039
politically very challenging because

679
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,360
it's now popular it's now a popular

680
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,799
piece of legislation it's now sort of

681
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,279
embedded into our system it's an

682
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,159
interesting lesson here in some

683
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:35,320
behavioral economics as applied to

684
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,520
economy which is we talked about loss

685
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,559
version the endowment effect another

686
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,640
version of the endowment effect is

687
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,960
what's called status quo bias which is

688
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,880
Once A law is in place it is harder to

689
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,880
take it away than it is to implement it

690
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,600
in the first place so one of the uh the

691
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,120
main criticisms you heard of the foral C

692
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,520
is oh it's socialized medicine and those

693
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,760
same critics would say it should be more

694
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,760
like Medicare

695
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,840
well Medicare is socialized medicine

696
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,080
Medicare is government provided

697
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,399
healthare for the for the elderly it's a

698
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,000
government system and you know one of

699
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,720
the most famous moments in the B foral

700
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,880
Care Act is people holding up a sign

701
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,120
saying keep the government's hands off

702
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,200
my medicare which is ironic because it's

703
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,080
a government program but it's embedded

704
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,600
it's in our endowment it's in the status

705
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,120
quo so we kind of like it so it does

706
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,000
sort of speak to how behavioral

707
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,520
economics matters in world world

708
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,159
political decisions as

709
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,679
well okay that's what I want to say just

710
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,919
last thing on coverage obviously there's

711
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,440
still

712
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,159
about uh on the order of 25 million

713
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,320
uninsured Americans maybe 30 million

714
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
uninsured Americans we still do not have

715
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,080
Universal coverage we've cut the number

716
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,880
almost in half the Affordable Care Act

717
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,279
which is great but it's still much too

718
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,480
large the question is what next and that

719
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,080
becomes the the debate that your

720
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,720
generation will have to engage in which

721
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,360
is how do we take it all the way to get

722
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,200
to getting everyone insured

723
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,440
okay so that's what want to say about

724
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,440
insurance coverage questions about

725
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,559
that all right now let's talk about the

726
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,000
other big topic let's talk about C

727
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,000
healthcare

728
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,840
costs by most estimates this is

729
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,679
imprecise by most estimates about a

730
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,240
third of what we spend on Healthcare in

731
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,399
the US does not actually improve

732
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,200
health which is sort of consistent with

733
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,080
the notion that we spend a third more

734
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,840
than other countries that are in

735
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,039
level okay about a third of what we

736
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,919
spend in healthcare is not actually

737
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,720
Health

738
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:42,000
improving so what is going on what's

739
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:45,320
going on is that there is no Market that

740
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,039
exists in history which is as Rife with

741
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,360
market failures as Healthcare every

742
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,159
market failure we learned about in this

743
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,399
class is Central to healthcare let's go

744
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:56,200
through them what's the First Market we

745
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:58,320
learned about Market power and Monopoly

746
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,799
well talk about Market power what

747
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,320
defeats Market power is the ability to

748
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,559
shop when you're in the back of an

749
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,000
ambulance having had a heart attack

750
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,039
you're not a very good

751
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,600
shopper okay there's no shopping in

752
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,320
healthcare information is incredibly bad

753
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,200
it's hard transaction costs are huge

754
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,840
there are very few competitive pressures

755
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,640
in the healthcare Market leading to

756
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,720
massive Market power some of the market

757
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,600
power is geographic okay if you have a

758
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,440
heart attack on Nantucket there is one

759
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,320
Hospital on Nantucket you're done talk

760
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,799
about timal Market power okay some of it

761
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,480
is not Geographic reputational

762
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,159
Boston has probably the highest density

763
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,559
of hospital beds per capita of anywhere

764
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,039
you cannot fall down without hitting a

765
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:39,000
hospital okay yet when David Ortiz was

766
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,919
shot in the Dominican Republic and flown

767
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
to America for treatment because

768
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,720
remember we do have the best Healthcare

769
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,559
if you're in the system did he go to the

770
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,679
official Hospital the Red Sox Beth

771
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,480
Israel one of the nation's top rated

772
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,159
hospitals no he went to MGH which is

773
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,200
slightly higher in the nation's rankings

774
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,200
and paid considerably more okay there's

775
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,159
also reputational monopolies monopolies

776
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,279
not have to be purely natural they can

777
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,799
come for other reasons which is people

778
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,080
always the very best hospital and that

779
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:06,760
gives Market power to the very best

780
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,320
hospital in Boston which is

781
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,360
MGH Mass General Hospital so basically

782
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,600
first market failure massive Market

783
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,360
power second market failure information

784
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,720
imperfections we talked about the

785
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,760
imperfect information in Insurance

786
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,679
markets what about imperfect information

787
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,399
in medical markets I go to the doctor

788
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,399
they tell me what test I need how do I

789
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,720
know if they're right how do I know

790
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,760
whether that's whether I need that test

791
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,840
or not how do I know whether I need the

792
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,600
treatment there's enormous information

793
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,559
asymmetries in healthcare third Mark of

794
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,519
failure we talked about

795
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,919
externalities Healthcare is a classic

796
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,000
externality if I don't have health

797
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,960
insurance and I get sick and I come and

798
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,840
cough on you you get sick that is a

799
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,600
classic negative externality or more

800
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,799
realistically if I'm

801
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,080
uninsured there's a law in America

802
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,360
called mtala which says emergency rooms

803
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,440
must treat everyone who shows up

804
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,720
regardless of their insurance coverage

805
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,240
so when uninsured people go to the

806
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,120
hospital they have to get treated how

807
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,640
does that get paid for by the hospital

808
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,799
charging more to their insured patients

809
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,240
that's an

810
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,720
externality so every market failure we

811
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,679
talked about is r in healthcare you

812
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,120
would never find a

813
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,399
market Which is less well

814
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,559
suited to the classic analysis we did in

815
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,440
the first half of this class and yet

816
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,080
unlike the rest of the world we allow

817
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,840
the free market to determine many of our

818
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,120
outcomes in healthcare

819
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,919
settings okay and in particular

820
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,760
there is a fundamental difference from

821
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,480
the rest of the world in the US we're

822
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,840
the only country in the world that does

823
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,240
not regulate our health care prices

824
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,720
let's go back to the Monopoly analysis

825
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,360
we talked about how with

826
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,919
Monopoly you have a situation where you

827
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,799
can improve outcomes through regulation

828
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,919
not necessarily you can go too far but

829
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,919
basically there a deadweight loss from

830
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:54,279
under production and regulation can

831
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,760
prove outcomes we talked about

832
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,679
information asymmetries we talked about

833
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,880
regulations like mandates and subsidies

834
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,880
can Pro outcomes externalities we talked

835
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,320
about corrective taxation when there's

836
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,720
market failures you need government

837
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,600
involvement and the US now to be clear

838
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,200
let me be very clear the US does not

839
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,559
have a purely private healthare system

840
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,960
literally if you look at us Healthcare

841
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,840
spending 50% is government and 50% is

842
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,960
private we're a very mixed system the

843
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,240
difference from other and other

844
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,639
countries are mixed too every other

845
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,080
country also has some public and some

846
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:25,120
private spending the difference is other

847
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,519
countries regulate the private sector in

848
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,639
a way we don't other countries set the

849
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,600
prices that doctors and hospitals and

850
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:35,960
drugs can charge and the US does not

851
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,039
okay and that is the fund I think where

852
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,600
Health economists now are that is the

853
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,399
fundamental difference the fundamental

854
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,679
challenge that we face it's a challenge

855
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,159
that leads to a number of problems the

856
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,440
first problem is we know in the Monopoly

857
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,880
case prices will be too high okay the

858
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,840
first problem pric are just too high

859
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,519
price too high we spend too much money

860
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,200
so for example for a typical drug or

861
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,960
procedure we pay two to three times what

862
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,440
they pay in Europe

863
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,120
okay an MRI in a Boston Hospital $1,500

864
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,240
in Japan is

865
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,559
$75 okay we have massive differences

866
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,840
that's the first

867
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,039
problem the second problem is more

868
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,399
subtle but important as we think about

869
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,120
Market design thinking about more

870
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:20,159
sophisticated models of markets than we

871
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,000
covered in this class which is when you

872
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,760
have imperfect information and so when

873
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,960
selling good soone buying the good there

874
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,399
will emerge a class of middlemen which

875
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,159
will help negotiate between the

876
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,919
uninformed seller the informed selling

877
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,200
or the uninformed buyer of the good

878
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,399
which in principle is good they can help

879
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,960
squeeze the rents out the problem is in

880
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:38,240
practice the whole extra layer of

881
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,880
expenses you add in America you don't

882
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,559
have in other

883
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,840
countries the bottom line is we spend a

884
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,080
lot more simply because we not regulate

885
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,840
prices okay and the answer is really

886
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,880
easy we just need to regulate prices we

887
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,639
do what the rest of the world does

888
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,639
regulate prices the problem is the

889
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,080
politics and it's once again the status

890
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:01,760
quo bias if it's one thing to set up a

891
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,720
new system with regulated prices it's

892
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,200
another thing to take an existing system

893
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,639
and regulate the prices and the reason

894
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,080
as the famous Health Economist U

895
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:14,200
Reinhardt once said is that health care

896
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,039
costs are also Healthcare income and

897
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,720
when you cut costs you're often cutting

898
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:20,919
someone's income and that person will

899
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,279
get politically involved to stop you so

900
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:26,760
let me give a classic depressing

901
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,880
example some drugs we buy at the

902
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,080
pharmacy some drugs are

903
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,840
injected those injected drugs are at the

904
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,279
doctor's office those injected drugs are

905
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,440
reimbursed by Medicare for elderly with

906
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,760
a specific rule which is when the doctor

907
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,000
get you with those drugs the doctor's

908
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,159
reimbursed besides the cost of drugs the

909
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,320
doctor's effort is reimbursed at s and a

910
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,519
half percent of the cost of the drug

911
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,559
think about what that means that means

912
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,679
if I give Andrew a shot that cost $100 I

913
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,200
get

914
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,960
$7.50 if I give Andrew a cost shot that

915
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,399
cost $1,000

916
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,639
effort same risk of carpal tunnels okay

917
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,480
I get

918
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:07,360
$75 that makes no sense remember we

919
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,359
should reward marginal costs we should

920
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,000
said the marginal benefits of the

921
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,119
marginal costs well here the marginal

922
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,399
benefit of my giving into a more

923
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,800
expensive shot is way higher my marginal

924
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,560
cost is the same that makes no sense so

925
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,000
20 Senators wrote a letteror President

926
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,000
Obama shortly after he entered office

927
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,720
saying this system's broken we to fix it

928
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,960
and President Obama then developed a

929
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,320
proposal to fix it he said no we should

930
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,399
pay doctors the fixed amount it's a

931
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,720
fixed amount of effort so it should be a

932
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:35,200
fixed

933
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,599
reimbursement okay makes sense every

934
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,560
Economist in the world said that was

935
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,599
sensible okay um shortly that after he

936
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,159
made that proposal 80 Senators including

937
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,679
almost all the original 20 wrote a

938
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,359
letter to him saying how dare you

939
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,800
propose such a radical and destructive

940
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,320
reform to the US Healthcare System

941
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,760
you'll destroy the US Healthcare System

942
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,160
with such a proposal what happened well

943
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,960
the guys give the Thousand shots are

944
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,359
called on ol ologists they're cancer

945
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,960
doctors they lobbied they got to the

946
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,160
congressman and said look we want to

947
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,680
keep getting 75 bucks for th shot we'll

948
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,760
make up some reason why it's a

949
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,240
bad

950
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,000
idea and you'll advocate for us because

951
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,400
we contribute to your campaigns and they

952
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,720
did and the proposal was killed we still

953
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,160
pay in this broken

954
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,920
way okay it is that's the difficulty

955
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,520
that the status quo bias so while status

956
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,640
quo bias in some sense was my friend as

957
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,240
a fan of the Affordable Care Act and

958
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,760
preserving the Affordable Care

959
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,400
Act as someone who wants ultimately

960
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,880
rationally regulate Healthcare prices

961
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,640
it's it's an enemy it makes it hard to

962
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:39,560
go forward so what do you do well it's

963
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,560
very hard and I don't really know the

964
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,640
answer this is really in some sense the

965
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,200
struggle of your generation let me be

966
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,680
clear this 18% number we can afford we

967
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,200
can afford to spend 8% of Healthcare on

968
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,079
the US the projection is by the end of

969
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,440
the century this number is 40% we cannot

970
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,880
afford that something has to give we are

971
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,680
going to going to have to take steps

972
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,800
burden on I I like to say there's only

973
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,720
two things in the world that really

974
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,319
matter for the long run which is global

975
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,520
warming and healthare costs because

976
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:09,040
either way you're

977
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,720
underwater okay we cannot as a nation

978
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,640
afford to spend 40% of our healthare

979
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,040
spending 40% of our GDP on Healthcare

980
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Something's Gonna have to give so how do

981
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,440
you do this well the first step the

982
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,960
first B first sort of victory has

983
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,040
already been struck which is that the

984
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,079
place where people are most interested

985
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,079
in regulating drug prices and regulating

986
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,079
prices in drugs pharmaceutical sector

987
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,480
why are they most interested in

988
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,839
regulating pharmaceutical prices well

989
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,319
the theory most people give is because

990
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,640
they're the most transparent prices in

991
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,880
the healthcare sector you don't know

992
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,119
when you get surgery you have no idea

993
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,119
what the doctors get what the hospitals

994
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,720
get when you buy a drug you see the

995
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,760
price of the drug so that transparency

996
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,839
and the enormous high prices make people

997
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,560
upset and that's why they come at it I

998
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,720
have another theory my theory is that

999
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,000
people are mad at the drug companies

1000
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,319
because they're ads now kids are a

1001
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,319
little bit younger than my kids but grew

1002
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:04,480
up in a similar era did you ever ask

1003
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:05,800
your parents as my kids did what's

1004
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,720
Viagra and why is that guy throwing that

1005
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,280
ball through the tire over and over

1006
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,720
again okay I got pissed I was like why

1007
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,160
are they putting this stuff on TV indeed

1008
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,240
I have a friend true story he's a

1009
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,640
pediatrician in Lexington where I live

1010
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,800
and he said a nine-year-old come into

1011
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,079
his office and say I'd like to talk to

1012
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,280
you about seis which is an erectile

1013
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,000
dysfunction drug for those who don't

1014
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
know and the pediatrician said why and

1015
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,920
he said well it's said on TV talk to

1016
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,240
your drct about

1017
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,119
seis okay I think people are mad at the

1018
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,880
drug companies the price are high and so

1019
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,800
in the recently past inflation reduction

1020
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,160
act for the first time in our nation's

1021
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,000
history we came in and regulated drug

1022
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,720
prices on a very small sub 10 drugs 10

1023
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,400
of the thousands we take it was an

1024
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,560
incremental step but it was a step

1025
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,640
forward so the so maybe that's a good

1026
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,400
sign that we can move forward to this by

1027
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,640
the way

1028
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,920
editorializing many economists would not

1029
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,200
agree with my position on this okay but

1030
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,839
I think that that up a step forward now

1031
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,680
why would other economists not agree

1032
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:06,720
with me what is the best

1033
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,200
counterargument against regulating

1034
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,680
prices well there's two the first is the

1035
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,359
government will screw it up and that's

1036
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,760
an absolutely valid argument remember we

1037
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:16,400
talked about Monopoly price regulation

1038
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,079
if the government set the price too low

1039
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,839
it was worse than not regulating at all

1040
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,839
totally valid point you know uh we can

1041
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:26,640
debate that all day there's a second

1042
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,520
point which is less valid which is it

1043
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,960
will kill innovation

1044
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,560
and here's how the argument goes the US

1045
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,359
has the highest drug prices in the world

1046
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,560
we also have do the most drug R&D in the

1047
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,440
world indeed a huge share of all the R&D

1048
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,440
done in America is pharmaceutical R&D

1049
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,359
it's the largest source of famous

1050
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,599
manufacturing R&D in America is

1051
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:47,400
pharmaceutical where do they get the

1052
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,000
money from that R&D from the excessive

1053
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,040
prices they get for their drugs so the

1054
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,240
argument was if we regulate drug prices

1055
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,680
pharmaceutical compies would no longer

1056
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,200
innovate and deliver the incredible

1057
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,880
drugs that that are amazing miraculous

1058
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,920
okay the drugs we have are miraculous

1059
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,319
now okay look no further than the covid

1060
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,000
vaccine to see the miracle that we get

1061
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:11,960
from drug

1062
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,319
development that argument is in theory

1063
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,560
right in practice very misleading and

1064
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,920
why is that once again this is I want to

1065
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,520
think about how we apply we learned in

1066
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,960
this class think about that so you could

1067
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,599
see the argument which is Monopoly

1068
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,040
profits the rents monopolis earn have a

1069
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,880
different effect because remember I

1070
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,000
showed you in external we underinvested

1071
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,960
R&D right we undervest in R&D so it's a

1072
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,720
totally legitim economic legitimate

1073
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,440
argument that the cost of distorting the

1074
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,800
Distortion from monopolis making too

1075
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,280
much money is worth it because we

1076
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,119
subsidize R&D as a positive externality

1077
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,599
like the externalities could cancel the

1078
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,000
market value of monopolis getting too

1079
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,040
much money could be canell by the

1080
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,160
positive

1081
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,359
externality of producing more R&D people

1082
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,960
see so that's just a classic

1083
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:02,040
externalities argument

1084
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,319
what it misses is R&D consists of two

1085
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,680
parts the basic science and applying the

1086
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,760
science and in fact the basic science is

1087
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,280
not paid for by the drug companies it's

1088
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,440
paid for by the government and it turns

1089
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,040
out the rate of return Innovation to

1090
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,160
basic science is incredibly high so

1091
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,920
here's a super cool empirical study done

1092
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,880
here at MIT give you an example kind of

1093
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,839
empirical work economists do they looked

1094
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,280
at

1095
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,560
NIH

1096
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,599
grants that got funded and get funded

1097
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,359
that were very similar got funded and

1098
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,280
didn't get funded and they followed on

1099
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:38,079
and found what happened and what they

1100
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,599
found is that NIH funding funding from

1101
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,280
the National Institute of Health for

1102
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,400
basic science is incredibly productive

1103
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,359
in causing

1104
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,240
Innovation and by their estimates if we

1105
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,560
regulated drug prices and took that

1106
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,920
money and gave it to the government to

1107
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,640
fund basic science we'd be way better

1108
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,720
off in other words the notion these that

1109
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,680
you sort of in some sense have to give

1110
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,240
Monopoly profits to fund R&D is not

1111
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,839
right you can fund R&D with public

1112
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,720
dollars and you raise a lot of public

1113
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:06,079
dollars by regulating those drug prices

1114
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,400
this is an argument if you want to see

1115
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,400
this is sort of fleshed out much more in

1116
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,359
my book jump starting America uh with

1117
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,720
Simon Johnson we talk about how public

1118
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,839
R&D is an incredibly important part of

1119
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,319
the American growth story and uh these

1120
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,880
are places where it could play out so

1121
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:26,200
that is a very rapid overview of the the

1122
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,599
Healthcare System okay if you want to

1123
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,680
learn more there's lots of resources you

1124
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:32,200
want to learn about the ACA you can read

1125
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,720
my comic book if you want to learn more

1126
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,000
about Healthcare you can take my class

1127
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,960
1441 I spent about four lectures on this

1128
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,480
topic uh we don't currently have a

1129
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,280
health economics class unfortunately in

1130
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,520
MIT uh we may have one eventually but

1131
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,480
there's lots of resources you can look

1132
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,359
at to learn more and this as I said is

1133
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,280
the key public this and global climate

1134
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,079
change are the two key public policies

1135
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,119
who facing your generation going

1136
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,440
forward okay stop there new material

1137
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,920
here's the good news Okay hate to say it

1138
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:03,200
now nothing I T today on the exam okay

1139
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,359
this is all all for fun in quotes Okay

1140
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,440
so I hope you enjoyed learning that for

1141
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,400
Pure learning sake okay last thing I

1142
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,800
want to say which is um what I hope you

1143
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,920
got out of this course who what I hope

1144
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,520
you got out of this course was learning

1145
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,920
how to think like an economist I hope I

1146
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,440
inspired you to take more economics

1147
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,240
that's awesome even if I didn't I hope

1148
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,280
that you will take from this course the

1149
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,760
ability to think like economists the be

1150
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,400
able to think critically about the

1151
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,760
important problems and to recognize that

1152
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,720
everything has an opportunity cost

1153
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,839
everything is a trade-off nothing is

1154
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,559
easy okay everything requires thought

1155
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,559
everything requires some subtlety in

1156
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,079
trying to figure it out okay and we've

1157
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,359
given you the tools to do that okay

1158
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:47,520
we've given you the tools to always

1159
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:49,319
think about the marginal cost and

1160
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,640
marginal benefits of different decisions

1161
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,839
we've given you tools think about where

1162
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,760
markets working where they don't and to

1163
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,960
use those tools in everyday life and the

1164
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,760
best way I think can do this is with a

1165
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,119
joke okay and the joke which quite

1166
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,240
frankly could be told about engineering

1167
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,640
as well as economics but I like

1168
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,280
economics is about the priest the doctor

1169
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,800
and the economist to go golfing they go

1170
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,240
golfing and they get in the golf course

1171
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,160
and they're behind one guy golfing alone

1172
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,240
which is already unusual what's more

1173
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,319
unusual is he's awful he takes about 30

1174
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,359
shots per hole and what's even more than

1175
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,480
usual is he won't let the people behind

1176
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,559
him play through good golfers are

1177
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,280
supposed to if you're much worse people

1178
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,240
in front of you you're supposed to let

1179
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,079
people behind you play through he

1180
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,440
wouldn't let them so after nine holes

1181
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,440
the queue behind this guy is like

1182
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,760
hundred people these guys are so pissed

1183
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,800
they just quit they go back to the

1184
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,440
clubhouse they're so mad they're

1185
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,800
pounding their fist like what an

1186
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,599
why do you not let us play through

1187
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,880
someone comes up to them and says You

1188
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,520
must be new at the club here and they

1189
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,640
said yes we are they said well I could

1190
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,760
tell you're new because if you weren't

1191
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,440
new you'd know the guy who's playing

1192
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,760
ahead of you was blind and actually it's

1193
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,240
pretty amazing he can get the ball in

1194
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,040
the hole at all and you should be pretty

1195
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,319
you know upset at yourself that you

1196
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,280
would criticize this guy who's actually

1197
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:55,160
a pretty amazing go forgiv he's blind he

1198
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,000
walks away and there's a hush silence

1199
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,280
and the the doctor goes like I I feel

1200
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,359
terrible I can't believe I'm someone

1201
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,520
supposed to heal the sick and I here I

1202
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,319
am like insulting the sick I'm going to

1203
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,800
dedicate a wing of my hospit to the

1204
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:09,119
Blind and the priest goes you feel

1205
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,280
terrible I feel terrible I'm supposed to

1206
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,640
be giving Comfort to the ill and the

1207
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,800
sick and here I'm insulting the man I'm

1208
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,359
going to have a free soup kitchen for

1209
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,119
the Blind and they go to The Economist

1210
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,880
The Economist says well if he's blind

1211
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,960
why doesn't he golf at

1212
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,319
night which sort of points out that the

1213
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,119
role of Economist is to be a pain in the

1214
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:30,359
ass okay is to actually ask the

1215
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,559
difficult questions point out the

1216
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:34,079
challenges ask and to really think

1217
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,079
through the trade-offs that are inherent

1218
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,240
every decision we make in life okay and

1219
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,839
I hope you'll take that with you I hope

1220
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,400
it'll Inspire take more economics and

1221
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:41,880
thank you very much for for coming to

1222
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,659
class

1223
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,659
[Applause]
