1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,120
the research that's being done in the

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,560
clean energy sector is super important

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,280
in order to advance Solutions um using

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,760
the skills Technologies resources that

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,760
we do

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:17,279
[Music]

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,800
have my project was surrounding creating

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,720
a machine learning model that would

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,720
effectively predict how different

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,880
solutes and fluids flow through

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,640
fractured rocks underground we want to

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,720
monitor how solids and fluids flow so

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,079
that we can better manage carbon dioxide

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,680
storage nuclear waste repositories

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,480
groundwater contamination and all of

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,640
these things to ultimately be able to

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,480
develop better geothermal resources

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,160
having access to this kind of Technology

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,039
enables researchers scientists and

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,760
policy makers to be able to have access

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,840
to the data that allows them to make

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,840
decisions about how we're storing carbon

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,879
dioxide nuclear waste as well as

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,480
preventing groundwater contamination and

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,519
all of this ultimately brings us one

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,920
step closer to Bridging the energy

27
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:01,920
transition Gap
