1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,172
So we've reached the end
of our plenary program.

3
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:11,630
And [? Katerina ?]
and I would like

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,970
to take just a couple
of minutes in closing

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,880
to express our gratitude
to the people who made

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,750
today's symposium possible.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,700
So this morning, Sally
thanked a lot of people.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,930
We would, of course,
like to thank her.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,040
Thanks, Sally--

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,525
[APPLAUSE]

11
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:33,000

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,480
--and also Dean Anantha
Chandrakasan and Dean Nergis

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
Mavalvala.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,400
The commitment of
Sally and Anantha

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,000
and Nergis to advancing our
understanding of biology

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,880
and human health through
interdisciplinary collaboration

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,480
is the driving force behind
the HEALS collaborative

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,980
that we're launching today.

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,490
So today's symposium would
not have been possible

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,380
without our multitalented
planning committee.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,370
Their names are listed here.

22
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,590
You saw many of them
on the stage here today

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,680
or running breakout sessions.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,260
This is the group that took
the charge of the deans

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,000
and turned it into a day of
exciting MIT research highlights

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,660
from all across campus.

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,870
So we're very
grateful for the ideas

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,390
and the enthusiasm
of the committee that

29
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,230
brought the event to life.

30
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,730
[APPLAUSE]

31
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,670

32
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,390
And, finally, a
huge thank you to

33
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,610
the amazing administrative,
technical, communication,

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,090
safety, transportation,
facilities staff

35
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,660
who worked tirelessly to
ensure a successful event.

36
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,480
[? Katerina ?]
and I particularly

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,450
want to thank Marsha Warren,
who's lurking here somewhere.

38
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,090
Thank you, Marsha.

39
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,640
She's been keeping us
organized from day one.

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,100
We never could have
gotten here without you,

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,250
so thank you so much.

42
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,210
So while the formal part of
our day is coming to an end,

43
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,870
the discoveries
do not stop here.

44
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,419
We invite you to
continue the conversation

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,880
and explore the amazing work
of our students and postdocs

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,900
that really drive the innovation
at the poster session that

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,870
is set up right next
door in the tent.

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,900
This is your chance to connect
with the brilliant minds

49
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,750
directly.

50
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,800
And I promise it will feel like
a treasure trove of discovery

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,330
and exciting research.

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,430
A special thank you
for the poster session

53
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,230
goes to Iain Cheeseman, a key
member of the committee also,

54
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,120
and Katey Provost
and Tia Giurleo.

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,570
It is incredible how much
work they put into it.

56
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,490
I really underestimated
how many hours.

57
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,920
Very, very, very big thank
you, their dedication

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,030
made this exciting
opportunity possible.

59
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,510
And thank you all
again for being

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,650
part of this vibrant community
and bringing your curiosity

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,980
to this wonderful day.

62
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,940
Let's celebrate the future
of health and life sciences

63
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,350
and continue to push the
boundaries of what's possible.

64
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,100
[APPLAUSE]

65
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,000
