00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,440
The GVAS study aims to perform the

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,160
largest sequencing project to date of

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,559
individuals with SCAD. We are working

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,119
together to create a research community

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,600
of individuals highly motivated to

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,840
investigate the genetics of SCAD and set

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
the foundation for future research. This

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,000
community is enhanced by the

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,279
contributions and partnership from the

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,119
ICAD registry and SCADAD Alliance which

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,880
also aim to better understand and

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,880
support patients with SCAD.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,600
>> We invite members of the SCAD community

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,040
to join the GVAS research study and

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,559
share it with others.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,719
>> Your partnership will be key in

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,640
understanding why SCAD happens and how

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,640
it can be prevented and treated.
