1
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,839
hi everybody today we're going to um

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,359
spend the bulk of our time uh making up

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,199
for sort of for lost lab time lost time

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,359
uh coding and doing implementing some of

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,960
the ideas that we have but first we're

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,679
going to step back to um just a little

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,119
bit on the the quiz apologies for taking

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,399
a while to get it back to you but now

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,160
you have it and the quiz is sort of the

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,079
opposite right of the um of the

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,200
Practical side it's the more of the

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,640
theoretical side so I wanted to talk

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,760
about a couple aspects of that um

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,960
somebody's going to remind me put the

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,399
screen back down Paul's not here today

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,320
um so please do that um some of the

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:57,480
Practical aspects on the quiz in space

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,800
um first you know why are authors and

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,920
articles important why why am I really

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,760
sensing that you know not just you know

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,880
what the three contexts are or what

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,600
optic is but really whose idea this is

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,320
and there's really two reasons one the

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,400
field is small the field is small and if

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,159
you're working in it and it's it's young

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,920
like like not young as y'all or it's

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,280
even older than than me but but young

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,200
like Mo almost everyone who has come up

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,759
with the great ideas that have changed

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,360
the field are still living and people

31
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,439
you can meet um the but more importantly

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,600
um and so some of the uh some of the

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,000
guest speakers that we've had recently

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,119
have appeared it's campus preview

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,200
weekend so we got to close this um

36
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,880
otherwise it'll get loud okay but some

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,960
of the speakers that we've seen have

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
actually already appeared in articles

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,640
that we've been reading and things so

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,920
these are names that will keep popping

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,759
up again and um when when David here on

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,439
talks about Carol Crum hunel who was

43
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,680
after the uh the quiz but you know that

44
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,520
this is a name that oh I've already read

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,599
that the other um first reason is that

46
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,440
uh I don't know if you saw on one of our

47
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,800
um guest speakers on music uh cognition

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,599
a lot of times there were you know these

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,360
nice pretty pictures of I don't know can

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,640
I draw a light bulb or something like

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,280
that and some idea and things and over

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:32,200
in the corner you you would see like um

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:36,959
Devin's 20 19 or whatever right and

54
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,480
those are just um ways there industry

55
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,159
shortcuts for how you can learn more

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,720
about a particular topic so I don't tend

57
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,440
to talk with footnotes maybe I should

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,120
more uh Strunk and white

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,360
2004 um and uh you know but but these

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,840
are things that that people do uh quite

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,200
often and it's because um here's the

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,720
worst thing about almost every article

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,840
you'll read whether in science

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,879
engineering Humanities Arts um that like

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm telling you to read these articles

66
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,519
and things but then the Articles aren't

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,440
actually written for you to read I mean

68
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,040
it's so ironic right you why why do we

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,560
write and publish research for the most

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:26,120
part we're publishing research to talk

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,680
to or to argue with or push back on or

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,360
develop the theory of somebody else

73
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,239
who's living so these these um Scholars

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,640
tend to talk to each other quite a bit

75
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,799
and so what they're doing when they're

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,840
putting these names down is really

77
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,959
there's a there's a seat here today if

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,040
you'd like U okay and um what they're

79
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,760
really doing is trying to uh trying to

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,640
argue against something that you might

81
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,280
not already know so when somebody's

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,439
presenting an idea they're really saying

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,840
um hey I've got a better idea than this

84
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,519
other person and so they're always going

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,959
to be talking about names of other

86
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,319
people and so it's just just kind of

87
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,680
good to get that so that's um something

88
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,879
there uh the other question I think that

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,959
can come up in the context of these um

90
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,920
quizzes based primarily on the readings

91
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,199
and these sort of abstract things is why

92
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,519
are there so many darn old articles in

93
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,160
this class why um are you doing a lot of

94
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,479
citations of things that are 10 years

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,720
old 25 years old and then you got the

96
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:32,479
iliac Suite um what is that 70 77 years

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,440
years old now uh so what's the point of

98
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,720
getting into it uh I so I've been

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,919
teaching for a while and one of the

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,440
there's one lecture that um I love the

101
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,560
topic um and I hope you'll love it too

102
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,919
when we get to it but I hate giving this

103
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:55,639
lecture it's the lecture on practical AI

104
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:59,280
in um in music and why is that it's

105
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,199
because the various techniques that I've

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,360
um been

107
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,400
teaching have changed so often that

108
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,000
they're not really relevant two years

109
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,520
later so I'm I'm going to be um you know

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,759
thinking about oh okay NE this weekend

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,479
it's time to update everything from

112
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,080
tensor flow which was so state-of

113
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,960
the-art three years ago and I wrote a

114
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,639
whole lecture around it to um for those

115
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,680
who know this P

116
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,720
torch which I'm using now and it really

117
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,039
means that there's a lot of things that

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,800
we'll be spending time in that class

119
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,680
that if P torch ends up not being the

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,960
the super great um thing that you're

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,919
going to be using for the rest of your

122
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,600
life because of GPT or whatever else

123
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,800
that's coming out those types of

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,440
information will get stale pretty fast

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,759
but the notion of things like um

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,360
equality and equivalence and and how you

127
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,039
can put equivalence classes I hope will

128
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,160
stay with you even if you're not doing

129
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,199
anything with music or or even anything

130
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,240
with comp computation I hope there

131
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,919
things that will stay with you for the

132
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,039
rest of your life and that you'll it'll

133
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,319
sort of change how you make an outlook

134
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:13,039
on the world so that's a little bit um

135
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,919
why this class has a good amount of it I

136
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,440
figure if it's something that inspired

137
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,919
me 15 years ago and it's still inspiring

138
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,800
me today it has a good chance that it'll

139
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,440
still be relevant inspirational uh in 10

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,840
20 30 years from now for those who um

141
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,880
did the work on the Glo Global rule um

142
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,520
somebody somebody remind somebody uh

143
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,560
remind us what the global rule is and

144
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,560
what first where where does it

145
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,360
apply want to take a guess Matthew do

146
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,560
you want to take a guess or calling

147
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,000
somebody else Counterpoint Counterpoint

148
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,000
great super so it's Counterpoint

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,240
Rule Rule and um what's it trying to

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,240
maximize in Counterpoint

151
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,960
uh just trying to

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,960
think let try to maximize in

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,280
kind that's it you want to try it um I

154
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,160
guess it's like trying to maximize like

155
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,080
the musical or like how good it sounds

156
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,080
Max musicality absolutely great

157
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,960
super and it does this ironically trying

158
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,919
to maximize musicality came down to

159
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,560
giving a formula right or giving uh

160
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,879
giving a set of formulas and and where

161
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,879
do we begin with the global

162
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:51,280
rule remember last start from the end

163
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,400
and go backwards and look at um

164
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,879
specifically do you have what three

165
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,879
possibilities of the last

166
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,879
one you're going

167
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
backwards now you have two possibilities

168
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,639
because you can't repeat notes in this

169
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,680
context so you can be trying here and

170
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,520
here against some

171
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,520
other thing David Luen would actually

172
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,039
not be happy with me he always did his

173
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,639
counterpoints in Alto cluff but we'll do

174
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,759
it in um in trouble and base so yeah

175
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,680
you're trying to figure out okay if we

176
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,080
end it here and the previous note is

177
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,800
here what are the other notes that we

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,640
can do so we have um traditional

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Counterpoint rules but we also have this

180
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,080
notion that every note that appears in

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,560
the

182
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,560
line must at some point find

183
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,560
what

184
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,160
remember every everybody quiet because

185
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,560
they all know this so easily or because

186
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,560
uh it's a little little foggy

187
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,320
easy foggy okay good that's good good I

188
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,320
I prefer silence when it's foggy because

189
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,760
then I know uh what to do next so uh in

190
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,959
order to get maximum musicality he

191
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,000
talked

192
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:16,680
about what begins

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,240
with he wants what kind of lines smooth

194
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,920
smooth lines so we want smooth lines so

195
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,279
if at some point you have a d here a low

196
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,640
D and we're going to get to see what

197
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,760
kind what are the notes that we need to

198
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,760
see after this oops

199
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,640
just turned red okay what are the notes

200
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,240
that we need to see after

201
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,000
this what's a note we need to see after

202
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,480
after

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,399
d what's that e e good good so if we

204
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,720
have an

205
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,279
e then what happens if we have another D

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,600
after

207
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,600
that what are we going to need after the

208
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,000
D at some

209
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,200
point what go ahead another E another E

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,040
good so

211
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,760
basically whenever you have a note you

212
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,640
have to have after it every note between

213
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,920
here not every uh every dionic note not

214
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,040
right not every chronic note you're not

215
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,040
going to need a d SHP at some point

216
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,240
every dionic note between here and the

217
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,320
final Cadence note that's why it was a

218
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,600
little bit easier to work backwards now

219
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,640
why is this rule um why was this rule

220
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,760
important for this

221
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,519
class this one this one might be a

222
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,519
silent because it's pretty easy cuz is

223
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,959
almost everything in this

224
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,959
class who can do

225
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
it

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,480
that's what kind of thing can apply this

227
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,279
rule computer okay so that you can have

228
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,920
an Al it can all be done the ironic

229
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,279
thing where're maximizing musicality

230
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,800
through

231
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:58,000
algorithms um great so that's about all

232
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,760
I want on that

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,959
um and people who uh who chose that

234
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,680
problem uh those tended to do pretty

235
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,399
well now let's get

236
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,399
to

237
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,600
second

238
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,800
equality and

239
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,720
equivalence and almost everybody chose

240
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,600
to do this

241
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,440
one um what's the name associated with

242
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
this without looking down Dimitri is the

243
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,200
first

244
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:31,800
name TCO let's try to spell it together

245
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:36,880
give me a t give me a y give me

246
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,399
a m give me a o

247
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,680
c

248
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:48,720
z k k q q deat q he'd like that um no D

249
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,480
much Co right uh so it's this one's a

250
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,160
little bit hard and I would not uh you

251
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,519
know whatever uh basically one of the

252
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:00,480
things I try to do is um I put in optic

253
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,360
and whatever you put and see if Google

254
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,639
could find the author on the first um

255
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,320
thing so that uh on the first page I and

256
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,880
um just remember that if you put in Wolf

257
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,480
Gang Mo mustard it finds Mozart so

258
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,240
Google's pretty good at this but um okay

259
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,360
so Demitri tko's uh optic almost

260
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,920
everybody got uh o optic op uh

261
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,440
octave

262
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,560
t

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,240
t i and C

264
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,360
good I know this was like back my hand I

265
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,760
just don't know how to spell the word

266
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,720
optic um and then most people thank you

267
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,160
for including my little contribution of

268
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,760
spelling on the list um a lot of people

269
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,360
great now so people did really really

270
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,320
great on that here are some of the

271
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,160
things that though were a little bit

272
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,399
harder um I think I might have thrown

273
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,839
some people for a loop and I didn't try

274
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,760
to you know grade too hard on this

275
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,240
because I realized oh I didn't do the

276
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,079
greatest job on this in lecture so was

277
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,279
the difference between equality and

278
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,040
equivalence when we talk about sameness

279
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,120
which one do you think we're most likely

280
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,880
talking about votes for

281
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,040
equality same

282
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,959
equivalents we have more un equivalence

283
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,760
yeah I might not have done as well on

284
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:23,680
this um I think of sameness as having

285
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,360
more to do with equality in some some

286
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:31,120
sense and equivalence meaning sort of

287
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
can be grouped together

288
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,160
and we could say it can be grouped

289
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
together in some logical connection or

290
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,160
can be grouped together connected with

291
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,399
some in some logical way and uh the

292
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,480
other thing that I think I probably

293
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,079
Falls a little bit on me because uh

294
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,399
didn't come out as clearly is that when

295
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,360
we're talking about same some people and

296
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,560
you got full credit if you did this

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,920
talked about sort of the big picture

298
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,199
this is same in every conceivable way so

299
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,759
are this piece is the same as this other

300
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,800
piece in every conceivable way um and

301
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,320
you know that that's one way that we can

302
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,959
think of sort of a grand scale equality

303
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,600
the problem is um that you you all are

304
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,800
really smart and you all know how to

305
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,839
conceive of things that that can break

306
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,680
that right you know you know I I hit

307
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,480
play on this um on this recording and

308
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,600
then I hit play on this recording again

309
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,920
but one of them happened um 10 minutes

310
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,839
later and one of them was played through

311
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,800
on speakers that had uh had uh 10

312
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,560
minutes more of um wear and tear on them

313
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,440
or something so you know you can always

314
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,240
conceive a way it's different so maybe

315
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,880
that's not as good but but we might

316
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,160
think of equality of aspects of of

317
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,240
something equality of aspects of um you

318
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,360
know that uh I'm trying to think you all

319
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,800
are sitting down so I'm trying to think

320
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,399
maybe maybe Jake is you know that we are

321
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,279
not exactly the same but but I think

322
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,440
we're approximately the same height

323
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,120
maybe we're the same height let's say

324
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,279
that we are so we are same in height or

325
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,560
something like that so two notes could

326
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:16,560
be same in frequency equal in frequency

327
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,360
so that's we tend to use equality for

328
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,560
some sort of attribute of something that

329
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,759
is identical or the or you know not

330
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,519
cannot be distinguished from each other

331
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:33,519
whereas equivalents we tend to think

332
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:38,279
of as things that we can group together

333
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:42,920
none of us are the same in um in any you

334
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:45,720
know in in any real deep great way but

335
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,360
we all um could be lumped under the

336
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,160
equivalence class of

337
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,480
MIT 21

338
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,079
m383 students

339
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,160
right and it kind of tells you also that

340
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,160
equivalence classes might be um

341
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,480
overlapping some of you might be also uh

342
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,759
MIT you know 6 uh 042 students together

343
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,399
or you could be in something else um so

344
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,120
they could be

345
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,040
overlapping then the the hardest part I

346
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,880
think on this problem that snagged a

347
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:23,759
bunch of people is um where um in what

348
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:27,319
contexts uh equivalence classes might um

349
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,920
you know might uh be used and why not

350
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,920
but we might think of

351
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:43,319
um as one chord arpeggiated

352
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,440
and as an as the same chord or yeah I

353
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:48,040
guess I just use same in an equivalent

354
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,319
sense so may maybe maybe I'm less uh

355
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,680
dogmatic that as an equivalent chord

356
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,319
even though one of

357
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,279
them

358
00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:01,319
was going up and the other one was going

359
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,039
down so we might think that the

360
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:05,199
permutation doesn't matter in that

361
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:07,120
particular class when we're talking

362
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,640
about what chord did I

363
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,959
apegate and then later we might say well

364
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,199
you know direction is another

365
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,360
equivalence class did it go up or did it

366
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,839
go down

367
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,559
um and contexts for when you might use

368
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,720
one and when you might not use one a lot

369
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,000
of times the context that where

370
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,400
equivalence classes come in it's sort of

371
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,240
a little kind of too obvious in a class

372
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,280
called computational music theory and

373
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,880
Analysis the equivalence classes tend

374
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,400
not come in very as often in

375
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,799
performance than in

376
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:46,160
analysis so um I think uh you know some

377
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,200
uh more than one person wrote um you

378
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,679
know well that you can think of a per a

379
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,880
performance where um cardinality doesn't

380
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,679
matter and yeah might have written

381
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,039
something like um well if you play that

382
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,080
measure three times because that's

383
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,600
what's written I only play at once uh

384
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,960
it's going to matter for our performance

385
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,559
last way but we might not think of the

386
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,080
cardinality as mattering if if we're

387
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,600
trying to do a search on does this piece

388
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,039
have any diminished Triads you know we

389
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,440
don't really care how many major Triads

390
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,440
and how many minor but in that case we

391
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,000
might just be lumping everything in

392
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,080
under the type of Triad equivalence

393
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,799
class and not counting how many um the

394
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,400
particular uh one but but we use these

395
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,480
all the time in real life so uh the

396
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,720
example that kind of popped into my head

397
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,919
today is um you know if you um if you're

398
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,919
going to uh Taylor Swift um you know if

399
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,320
you if you're going to be analyzing a

400
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,520
Taylor Swift song and you're going to

401
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,000
look at the harmonic structure of it

402
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,840
does it

403
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,360
matter presumably if if if you're

404
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,480
listening to Taylor Swift's recording or

405
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,159
if you're listening to a cover band one

406
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,960
that's trying to be faithful

407
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,960
for harmonic

408
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,039
structure not really right you hope a

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,280
good cover band is trying to sound like

410
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:14,360
that trying to use the same harmonies so

411
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,600
we could come up with a cover

412
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,960
band equivalence

413
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,919
class cover maybe we just call it the

414
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,440
cover equivalence class which applies if

415
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,720
you're doing harmonic

416
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,039
analysis does it matter whether you're

417
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,679
seeing Taylor Swift or cover band if you

418
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:33,640
just paid 9 $900 for front row

419
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,440
tickets yeah it does so we can think of

420
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,120
live performance as a place where cover

421
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,400
equivalence doesn't exist now we mostly

422
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,280
talked about Pitch equivalence so that's

423
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,080
um a big thing there um that so that we

424
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,840
might be thinking too much about pitch

425
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,000
and not enough about duration equivalent

426
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,120
not enough about bigger

427
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,320
things the other uh thing just to talk

428
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,159
about is that often when we're talking

429
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,440
about these pitch equivalences like

430
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,679
octave or cardinality or things we're

431
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,559
not really thinking about the um the

432
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,000
sort of I don't know the the scale of

433
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,280
the piece right we're not really

434
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,159
thinking does this piece have the same

435
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,360
number of notes as this piece if we

436
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,039
apply cardinality equivalents or

437
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,640
something right but we might be thinking

438
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:23,919
about does this chord have the same

439
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,159
number of unique pitch classes if we're

440
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,760
applying octave permutation

441
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,919
transposition and card

442
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,880
ity so that level um comes up quite a

443
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,919
bit I think there's one place where we

444
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,159
have um where we do tend to think of

445
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,280
equivalence classes on a peace

446
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:48,320
level

447
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,559
sometimes that's when you have you know

448
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,200
uh I don't know uh

449
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:57,000
Beethoven's

450
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,760
uh third Symphony

451
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,559
in no e flat major sorry of course this

452
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,400
is this isn't a music history class on

453
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,840
on the history of ban but that we do

454
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,480
tend to group pieces in classical music

455
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,600
by key um the other place where that

456
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
immediately comes ahead where there

457
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,039
might be equivalence classes of um of

458
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,559
pieces is a DJ might have a beats per

459
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,960
minute equivalence class where you want

460
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,840
to group together all songs with the

461
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,919
same BPM so you can switch between them

462
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:32,799
so uh think on that um any any thoughts

463
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:35,159
or questions on on this

464
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,600
um and thank you to the person who gave

465
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,840
me the opportunity to explore the um

466
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,840
permutation equivalence class on Happy

467
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,960
Birthday um

468
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:53,960
okay last last one talk about the three

469
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,760
contexts um this one uh I uh was a

470
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,320
little bit harder some people uh got uh

471
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,480
it was by Elanor suffrage field and some

472
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,840
people um thought it was the decently

473
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,200
similar about the same time in the

474
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,159
semester article by Nicholas cook and if

475
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,480
you wrot wrote that you know you were

476
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,720
getting some credit because you were

477
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,480
really in the in the right ballpark um

478
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,000
so she talks about the three main

479
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,840
contexts he talks about are you can read

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,240
them off we're better say them out first

481
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,720
one symbolic the symbolic is one is well

482
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,400
we'll get it is there but not one one of

483
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,960
her terms we can that ends up being the

484
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,640
problematic one but yeah we'll keep that

485
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:39,320
one else what's that graphical graphical

486
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,120
yep graphical and what's the opposite

487
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,320
what's what do we contrast graphical

488
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,600
things

489
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,720
with sound

490
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:53,400
good and then the logical is what she

491
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,720
has and and so symbolic will be in there

492
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,960
things um one of the the things that

493
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,120
came up a lot in the quiz was that

494
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:06,559
people were immediately uh going to a

495
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,320
higher level than what she was intending

496
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,720
so when we think about

497
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,279
graphical this is sort of a graphical

498
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,240
context for representing music right but

499
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:21,159
in her mind what is the graphical thing

500
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,679
I just created here anyone want to take

501
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,520
a guess don't go too

502
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,960
high Circle in a line Circle in a line

503
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,840
is going to say okay great a circle and

504
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:37,200
a line so by the time you move that to

505
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,520
um Professor you drew a quarter note

506
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,360
with a stem

507
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,320
down stem down on the third space and

508
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,039
you know with this context you draw c um

509
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,679
you've already been moving to The

510
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:53,720
Logical

511
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,600
domain similarly when you hear a sound

512
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,960
so I I can only represent sound right

513
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,760
now well I can do I can do it in the

514
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,120
sound domain but you know in the graphic

515
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,880
domain of sound

516
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:10,840
um you don't necessarily yet hear oh I

517
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,320
hear a c maybe you can say or I hear an

518
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,000
a maybe you can say uh if you're an

519
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,760
oscillator in your head you can say I

520
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,640
hear something oscillating at 440 times

521
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,880
per second but then to move that to an a

522
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,679
for octave 4 is motion to The Logical

523
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,279
domain so this I don't think I was clear

524
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,679
enough on maybe maybe eler selfish field

525
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,279
wasn't enough or we we just need to read

526
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,600
it a little bit more closely and

527
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:41,080
similarly um even things like instrument

528
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,679
I hear an instrument you're already

529
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,159
moving to The Logical domain you might

530
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,520
uh if you're if you're a signal

531
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,520
processor be saying oh I'm hearing a

532
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,840
waveform where only the odd partial

533
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,399
harmonics are

534
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,440
present and then your memory bank is

535
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:04,000
saying oh I'm hearing

536
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,520
clarinet so those are the odd partials

537
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,640
right I don't teach that class yeah I

538
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:13,200
think that's right um okay so because

539
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,399
elements of The Logical domain we were a

540
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,159
lot of our answers were transferring to

541
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:23,279
the sound or the graphical domain The

542
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:27,600
Logical domain got uh care sort of um uh

543
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:30,880
sort of kingled up with the next higher

544
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,720
domain here the next more abstract thing

545
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,520
which in this case I'm going to call it

546
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,960
the

547
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:41,799
meaning

548
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,919
domain um we can call it the hair I'm

549
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,840
going to actually try to write this

550
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:48,120
without looking at

551
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,960
mudic domain which is sort of the study

552
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,720
of the construction of meaning or the

553
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,679
conceptualization of meaning it's

554
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,399
actually a pretty cool word if you don't

555
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,279
know it but I don't like it too much

556
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:00,120
because my whole life I've had I know

557
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:03,159
blow hards if I can say that word who

558
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,480
who uh who just miss who use hermeneutic

559
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,720
and throw it around everywhere oh I'm

560
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,320
having a hermeneutic construction of

561
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,640
meaning it's like well no that's just

562
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,320
what that means um if you learn up learn

563
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,840
your hermeneutics of hermeneutics so

564
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,559
I'll often just call it the meaning

565
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:21,640
domain and so you might be um you know

566
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:24,760
that your logical sound domain you've

567
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,600
heard and your graphical domain you saw

568
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,840
a whole bunch of things on page and your

569
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,720
logical domain said o uh there's a whole

570
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,720
bunch of randomly spaced staccato a or

571
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,080
even randomly spaced might be too too

572
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,559
far down um so at this level you might

573
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,279
say oh the title of the piece is

574
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,240
fireflies and this is a depiction of how

575
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,559
the fireflies are coming and out so

576
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,880
there is a next level of domain to have

577
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,520
there

578
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:00,480
um difficulty is that um there's this

579
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,360
word semantic that came up a

580
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,559
lot

581
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,200
semantic sorry I'm writing over it but

582
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm writing there for a particular

583
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,880
reason that

584
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:18,960
um that Elanor suffrage field kind of

585
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:20,799
uses to imply this level of

586
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,480
understanding that that's sort of the

587
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:27,480
greater meaning of things so it's a

588
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:31,399
fourth uh context there but over time

589
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,600
it's kind of been migrated up in music

590
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:36,960
um information retrieval to be closer to

591
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,520
the logical domain so people will s say

592
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,080
you know oh I don't want to you know I I

593
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,720
I I don't want to know exactly how

594
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,159
you're going to draw it on the page I

595
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,000
want to know it's semantically uh

596
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,679
quarter note

597
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,840
C5 or something and so this term I'm

598
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,919
going to try to avoid too much because

599
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:04,480
it's being used in sort of two very

600
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:08,159
different um contexts here okay

601
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,159
questions on this or more

602
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,320
discussion okay I know we want to uh get

603
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,640
to some coding and get to some other

604
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,159
things but thanks for um thanks for

605
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,799
sticking with all of this oh and and

606
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,880
there was one thing that came up uh and

607
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,200
a really good answer that made me uh

608
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,279
realize that I I definitely didn't say

609
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:37,000
this in class that um she says most

610
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:39,120
notation formats focus on one of these

611
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,679
or represent music representations focus

612
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,840
on one of these things so yeah

613
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:49,679
definitely the CD um you know focused on

614
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:53,039
sound and the um you know the this PDF

615
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:56,120
of Music focuses on graphics and things

616
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,159
like that but um the the one way that

617
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,640
that article has aged is that now

618
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,159
nowadays we have so many formats that

619
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,200
try to do encode two or more of these

620
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,080
things together so that you might have

621
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:13,399
music XML which is encoding some pixel

622
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,799
placements of notes also and also

623
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:19,799
encoding um you can do links to the to

624
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,880
the waveform of something and even um

625
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,640
going from CD to MP3 and modern formats

626
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,159
yes it encodes the sound but it also

627
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,159
encodes some of the metadata the year

628
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,440
composed and things like that and

629
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,440
nowadays they can even be um putting you

630
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,039
know recommendations to other songs or

631
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,000
something like that cool okay let's

632
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,840
let's let's come back because with um

633
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,440
want to want to make some things we've

634
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,320
been been in theory mode for too long

635
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,679
um so

636
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,919
we last class we ended by doing some

637
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,519
algorithm composition with random walks

638
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,039
and so I just um here's a random walk

639
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,159
composition that I wrote in 10 minutes

640
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,120
once and I always want to say one or two

641
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,279
things on it maybe you hate it maybe you

642
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,279
like it

643
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:22,609
[Music]

644
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:39,600
[Music]

645
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,360
so one of the things I did in my

646
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,559
aesthetic on the piece just to say a a

647
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,760
few little things on it is that I gave

648
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:50,720
um a large amount of gravity toward

649
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,519
whatever note which to kind of transpose

650
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,600
to make it more dissonant whatever note

651
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,519
something started on when it went away

652
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,880
it was really really likely to get

653
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,120
pulled back to where it came from so

654
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,000
that's why you'll see just a few things

655
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,320
that kind of get perturbed out of way

656
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,200
and then as the piece goes on in within

657
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,559
each section the gravity got weaker and

658
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,159
weaker and so that kind of let it have

659
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,240
um I don't know kind of the opposite of

660
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,880
a linian global rule that things got um

661
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,960
a little bit farther out as it went the

662
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,279
other thing that um I couldn't believe

663
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,320
when I when I first I was like oh I

664
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,960
think this will be a good idea write the

665
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,200
code write the code generate you know

666
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,760
put and it sounded just a mess tot maybe

667
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,919
it still sound like a mess to you but um

668
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,320
but putting in these art uh staccato

669
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,639
marks made all the difference for making

670
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,279
it more of a percussion percussive piece

671
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:43,600
so you can um do things like that if you

672
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,720
want your pieces to be a little bit more

673
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,279
uh interesting yeah is there some form

674
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,240
of articulation label that you could use

675
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:55,519
to avoid having to seado every note

676
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,399
um you could yeah in in modern thing you

677
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,039
would say um you dot dot dot then you

678
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,159
probably say stat Sim staccato similarly

679
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,840
staccato throughout or probably you

680
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,159
would just tell a performer you know if

681
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,720
you're talking about actual humans all

682
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,200
notes smaller than whole notes are stua

683
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,480
tiimo or

684
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,360
something is is it possible to implement

685
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,080
that in this graphical

686
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,279
software uh or does the med play not

687
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,760
recognize it doesn't recognize when you

688
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,799
when you start talking to the thing

689
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,639
you'll ever more expressive as it goes

690
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,519
yeah the midi just ignores that um for

691
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:35,360
the most part I mean maybe that's the

692
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,120
Great learn uh large language model uh

693
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,559
thing to the the first the first thing

694
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,600
that takes a mer score it's midi and

695
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,600
give it all of the his rehearsal

696
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,559
marks all that stuff it's like oh I must

697
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,919
I must turn myself into fire and perform

698
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,480
this uh in this way and yeah maybe that

699
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,559
would be kind of interesting uh I

700
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,200
thought of that thanks for the idea um

701
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,399
yeah so so we don't have that type of

702
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,519
thing besides when you're doing

703
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,840
computation things one one of the things

704
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:10,720
is it's pretty cheap to you know in a

705
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,000
loop put staccato on every single

706
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,799
thing yeah great so anyhow want to spend

707
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
time of that just a little um amuse Bo

708
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,200
before getting to go ahead and open up

709
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Jupiter

710
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,000
um give you a second or two

711
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:33,200
and we got we're sort of uh have a bunch

712
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,399
of little things that we haven't uh

713
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,480
gotten to yet that I want to make sure

714
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:43,440
that um that we can get to um reminder

715
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,000
that the problem set is sort of a

716
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,559
Russian nesting doll of unlocking tools

717
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,480
so that please pay very close attention

718
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:55,200
on each of the questions on what tools

719
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,360
have been unlocked but um if I'm telling

720
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,000
you well you now have access to cord now

721
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,720
you have access to Roman numeral I

722
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,360
should at least introduce these to you

723
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:08,040
right I can't remember if I introduce

724
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,839
chord very briefly um or if

725
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,320
um or if if we didn't I maybe I don't

726
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:16,839
think we did um probably need some other

727
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,960
things uh I'm going to import chord note

728
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:24,560
pitch for now so go ahead and do that I

729
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,919
put the screen down even it's all good

730
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,800
um okay so what the the hardest way that

731
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:34,879
you can create a chord is let's say C

732
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,240
equals note. note C I'm giving you the

733
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,639
hardest way so maybe you don't want to

734
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,440
do this because I'm going to give you

735
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,240
the easier way in a bit or if you just

736
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,599
get behind um note G oh I should

737
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,079
probably give them octaves shouldn't I

738
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:51,599
C4 E4

739
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:54,919
G4 and then we'll say CH for chord cha

740
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,200
um remember that chord is a bad name for

741
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,680
variable chord. pitch chord. chord uh

742
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:05,320
lowercase chord indicates it is

743
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,000
a module uppercase means class good and

744
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,720
so we're getting object to that so we

745
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,640
could do c

746
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,119
oops apparently there's a button for

747
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,240
Google

748
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,240
search uh

749
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,119
ceg and do

750
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,800
that um the other thing that you can do

751
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,880
and you can actually thank Dimitri

752
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,400
tachko for for bugging me on Mike why

753
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,359
can't I just do this okay

754
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,920
so that's more often how you're how

755
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:44,760
you're going to doing things when you're

756
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,200
coding here but obviously um when you're

757
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,000
doing something

758
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,680
algorithmically quite often you're going

759
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,599
to have notes you can also start with

760
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,280
pitches

761
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,520
here um some of the things to say chords

762
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,480
uh you can iterate over them for thing

763
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,920
in ch print

764
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,079
thing and you get the

765
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,040
notes and that each of the notes are

766
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,839
there you can change um the duration of

767
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,480
one note in a chord and not the other

768
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:18,319
but uh that doesn't work to to too well

769
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:22,720
you're um let's create a second

770
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:25,680
chord weird equals chord. cord oh I

771
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,720
don't know uh

772
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,280
E3 G5

773
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,130
five uh what are we going to do let's

774
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,920
put in uh

775
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,920
[Music]

776
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,880
D7

777
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,839
C 8 it's a pry weird chord I know I'll

778
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,960
put in a B9 in there just because I know

779
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,560
exactly what that will put in uh this is

780
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,359
the the function that you're going to

781
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:56,560
wish you had access to on one of them

782
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:56,560
the root function

783
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,359
we I'll kind of get that uh this one

784
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,359
might not have a

785
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:10,319
name common name diminish minor ninth

786
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,680
chord is that

787
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:13,680
correct we

788
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,760
doow that one went too high okay let's

789
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,040
let's oh because it's an E3 no that

790
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,040
actually might be correct because it has

791
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,720
to fit it all on one staff when you do

792
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,160
this maybe instead of e3 um let's say e

793
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,040
four

794
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:38,480
five six H octaves don't matter five

795
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,480
five six six it'll sort it for

796
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,560
us yeah that looks a little bit better

797
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:49,440
uh easier though

798
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:55,319
is uh close and weird guess I'll call it

799
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,319
equals weird do closed position

800
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,160
oops okay

801
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:09,319
and so who remembers what closed

802
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,319
position is from 301 or something like

803
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,760
that

804
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:18,560
yeah it's yeah it's all within within

805
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,680
one octave um there's actually two

806
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,440
different um things some some

807
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:27,760
definitions allow the base note to be in

808
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,400
a different octave and um and then the

809
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,000
but that the top notes are all as close

810
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,560
together as you can get yeah and that

811
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,560
that can be pretty useful for an

812
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:41,000
analysis type of task

813
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,880
right so we can oh let's we'll choose a

814
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,400
different um Bo piece today I'm I'm

815
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,920
sorry I'm not keeping up my promise to

816
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,119
do uh a bit more than just Bach but it

817
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,920
make does make things go a little bit

818
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,040
faster this will say Bach equals Corpus

819
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,319
so I'm importing Corpus sorry um I

820
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,720
should be talking around Corpus

821
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:08,160
bwv 269 this is going to be one of our

822
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,880
favorite ones uh coming up for a

823
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,880
bit I think it's 269 do I have the right

824
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,880
template out yep

825
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:28,720
great right

826
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:32,640
um and um so one of the things we can do

827
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,560
is we can get so what I call it Bach

828
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,200
let's do bach.

829
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,800
cify

830
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,480
doow thank you we've encountered this

831
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,079
but we haven't really talked about it

832
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,520
very much and I'm going to need to zoom

833
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,720
out for a second or you can do this on

834
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,960
your own or maybe I'll I'll just do this

835
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:57,839
bach. measures so we remember this BRS

836
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,359
with a pickup yep 0 through four. show

837
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,560
cify is slow enough so you probably

838
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,040
shouldn't call it every single time

839
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,960
bo. in fact might as well make the one

840
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:13,240
the part that's faster uh go first bl.

841
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,560
measure 04. cify doow you don't have to

842
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,359
am I going too fast

843
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,240
today yes I am good thank you for having

844
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,839
the courage to nod we do it so we're

845
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:25,359
going to do the same thing

846
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,640
and I just want to make sure that we can

847
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,640
kind of get I can't really tell tell if

848
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:33,400
that's a g but it does look about but

849
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,480
that does look about an octave below

850
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,240
that note and I do know that that's a g

851
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:41,480
and so yep so it's taking at every

852
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,440
moment what's sometimes called a salami

853
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,720
slice which is to say every time

854
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:51,400
something changes there is a new chord

855
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,760
created so we can see here that there's

856
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,240
nothing that changes here in between

857
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,480
here and here so this is a chord this is

858
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:02,119
a chord but here this will need to be

859
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:05,640
made into two chords in order to um deal

860
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:10,200
with it and we can kind of see here that

861
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:12,079
this works um it's rather hard to figure

862
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,520
out what chords these things are so what

863
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:21,200
did we just learn yeah what's MXL um

864
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:23,520
it's it's a music XML format that um

865
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,680
that is compressed music XML it's kind

866
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,880
of nice that music XML all compressed so

867
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,319
um

868
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,480
music XML takes up a a lot for um

869
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,880
notation format not a lot for video

870
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,160
format or something um not a lot for

871
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,680
something in the sound domain but a lot

872
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,640
for something in The Logical domain um

873
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,760
things so but it compresses incredibly

874
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,680
well anybody who um who works on

875
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,960
compression algorithms might find that

876
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,560
interesting so a lot of people compress

877
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,640
their music XML good question okay so

878
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,800
what's something we can we just learned

879
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,319
that we can do to um to help make this a

880
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,400
little bit easier to

881
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:07,440
read to figure out what chords are

882
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,400
happening get after to compress yeah yep

883
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,920
somebody want

884
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:16,160
to what was use to compress the chords

885
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:20,760
just learn close position good so let's

886
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,640
say uh CHF for cified is

887
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,359
Bach dot here we'll just make we'll just

888
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,359
do a little ex 0 through four. cify

889
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:34,920
and make sure that that's the same as

890
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,599
before I did type it right yep okay so

891
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,040
how am I going to do

892
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,200
this actually let's let's before I do

893
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,520
that let's just look at it in um text

894
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,000
show.

895
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,920
text an instrument 3 four yep and we

896
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,079
have all these chords within measure so

897
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,960
we want to put all of these chords into

898
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,920
Clos

899
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,800
position what's our favorite three

900
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,040
letter

901
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,520
word that we're going to start with four

902
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:05,400
four great so let's do this

903
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,839
um

904
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:12,760
for my chord in what what do we call

905
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,720
that we call that CHF for CHF do

906
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,559
something whisper to your neighbor what

907
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,720
the answer should be and then we'll shut

908
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:19,720
it out

909
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,400
who votes for the next who votes for the

910
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,400
next thing being a

911
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,599
Colin no nobody who votes for

912
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,599
recurse who votes for

913
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:51,119
flatten who gos for something

914
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:55,079
else okay something else but bracket the

915
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:58,839
cord class ah yeah bracket on the cord

916
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:02,760
class which is equivalent to anyone

917
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:04,640
remember recurse recurse and get

918
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,559
Elements by class so yeah that would be

919
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,440
really really great the other thing by

920
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,880
the way this is a case where flatten

921
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,400
isn't going to be too bad either because

922
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,440
we don't really care what order we're

923
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,760
getting them we're going to put them all

924
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:21,960
into closed position um so for my chord

925
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,559
in this thing we can do something like

926
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,559
this um we say Clos

927
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,760
position oh shoot

928
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,079
but that returns a new thing and we

929
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,960
don't have a stream to put it in um a

930
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,200
lot of these things that that change

931
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,920
streams and change chords and stuff like

932
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:43,880
that has an in place

933
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,760
option it also has something Force

934
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,440
octave and we'll say Force octave equals

935
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,680
four and that's something that's pretty

936
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,839
useful that says now you're shrinking

937
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,800
everything to be within one octave let's

938
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,040
not have you do your own transpose

939
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,960
function or something after there just

940
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,920
put it all into four so hopefully this

941
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,359
works I don't should that be running

942
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,440
close position on my cour not oh thank

943
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:11,160
you thank you the this class is like a

944
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:14,599
like a running um example of how two

945
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,319
people coding code uh faster than two

946
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,640
two people coding together code more

947
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,520
code faster than uh than two people

948
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,079
coding separately maybe not 17 well it's

949
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,720
probably too many but yeah um so they I

950
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,480
haven't

951
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,640
figure out the time to fix this the tie

952
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,800
algorithm when you do close position

953
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,040
because obviously it's kind of cool that

954
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,800
it finds that oh there's there's a tie

955
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,920
that was opened but then this got moved

956
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,839
to here something so great so now we

957
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,599
have a certain number of chords here um

958
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,440
that're Happening Here uh what key do we

959
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,880
think the piece is in now that we can

960
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,760
see it more

961
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,359
easily g g g major good good and so now

962
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,800
we can start putting Roman numerals on

963
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,559
things what we call this in G major the

964
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,559
first

965
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:13,040
one four four four six four in first

966
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:16,200
inversion six six

967
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,839
yep six five first inversion five first

968
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,359
inversion now then there's certain

969
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:24,040
things that we have to be like o but was

970
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:27,319
that we go all the way back up to

971
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:29,480
here no okay good that it what's hard to

972
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:31,559
tell is if that was a passing tone or if

973
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,800
that was which one of these two was the

974
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:35,559
passing tone in that case can you see my

975
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,520
pointer yeah which one of those two is

976
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,800
the passing tone there great so we can

977
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,599
go um there and we can do this here

978
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,200
we'll get to how we can have the

979
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,319
computer do all this for us in just a

980
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,960
bit

981
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,880
um questions or anything I should go a

982
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,680
little bit more slowly yeah John if we

983
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,119
four OCT to be four in fifth OCT why do

984
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,720
we have some notes in the fifth off

985
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,640
that's that's great it what it says is

986
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:07,400
it forc the lowest note to be an octave

987
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:11,400
4 and so since it it can go up to an

988
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,359
octave um yeah so that's that's the the

989
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,400
case where it's the highest here it does

990
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,000
mean if you do uh compositions where

991
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,359
you're putting chords in closed

992
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,079
positions and jumping them around uh it

993
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:28,400
can it can sound very jumpy so that's

994
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:30,599
one examples here great

995
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,440
any I think else I should have been

996
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:36,559
going with this let

997
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,800
me okay um let's dur the chord class for

998
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,200
a

999
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:43,079
second chord.

1000
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:46,760
chord oops actually I should be just

1001
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:50,720
during the one of the

1002
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:52,720
chords so some of the things um are are

1003
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,559
things that you've already seen um

1004
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,000
because chords are music 21 object

1005
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,760
obviously they have a duration you know

1006
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,480
how to deal with it they don't have a

1007
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,000
DOT pitch object they have a attribute

1008
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,640
they have a DOT pitches which gives you

1009
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
all the pitches there but there's some

1010
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,839
kind of um things can be tonic can this

1011
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,599
chord be a tonic in some

1012
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,599
key what chords can be

1013
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,640
tonics what kinds of chords what

1014
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:22,319
equivalence class of

1015
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:25,960
chords major major chords and minor

1016
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,400
minor chords great super so um that's

1017
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,680
some of the things um does the chord

1018
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,440
contain a seventh I think weird does

1019
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,599
right do

1020
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,000
contains

1021
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:42,079
seventh true but um do we still have

1022
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,920
that first one yep CH contains seventh

1023
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,920
so you'll find that there's all these

1024
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:51,160
slightly useful things in here um I

1025
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,119
don't know what see is it an augmented

1026
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,079
Triad is an augmented sixth is it a

1027
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,760
French augmented six is a half diminish

1028
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,119
augmented sixth a l of these things here

1029
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,440
is it transpositionally symmetrical

1030
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:06,119
these things come up um quite a bit and

1031
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,880
you can put the same pitch more than

1032
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,680
once into a cord so sometimes you want

1033
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,799
to remove the Redundant pitches

1034
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:17,319
redundant pitch classes and so

1035
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:19,799
on um sometimes you might have weird

1036
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:21,160
chords that you want to respell and so

1037
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:25,160
on so these are some of the things that

1038
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:27,240
are kind of useful in here and um if we

1039
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,559
want to talk about uh on top ology

1040
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:34,680
errors here CH do3 gives you the third

1041
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:38,960
ch. fth gives you the fifth and ch. base

1042
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:41,040
gives you a bound method of something so

1043
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,720
that's something I wish I I wish I could

1044
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,280
figure out how to change that these were

1045
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,079
done differently early on and it's a

1046
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,359
little too late sometimes to change

1047
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,640
things just like it's a little too late

1048
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:53,520
to change how certain words in English

1049
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,319
are

1050
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,960
spelled Okay cool so that's the end of

1051
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,799
the introduction to chords unless

1052
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,680
there's people want to do something with

1053
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:06,680
this

1054
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,200
them what's that Roman numeral Roman

1055
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,799
numerals we'll get to Roman numerals in

1056
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,760
just just a second so great so we're

1057
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:18,599
definitely going to get to Roman

1058
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:22,200
numerals but first a small um a small

1059
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:25,040
leftover from um from our work on um

1060
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:30,400
cognition and keys and the probone

1061
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:35,319
method by anyone know if you know the

1062
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:39,200
author what Carol Carol Kum hunel great

1063
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:41,799
yep uh py was one of the people who who

1064
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,359
referenced um this yeah the proone

1065
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:48,160
method by uh crun Crum hunel car Crum

1066
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:52,520
hunel um and so we're going to do is I'm

1067
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:55,000
going to get us two two pieces here um

1068
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,559
you don't have to um do this part if you

1069
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,160
don't you you actually at this point in

1070
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,520
the semester you don't have to type

1071
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,440
anything that I'm typing unless it's

1072
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,359
helpful for you maybe in the first part

1073
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,760
is good so this is the um a particular

1074
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:12,119
little jig we're going to be working

1075
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,160
with a lot of jigs um in the next time

1076
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:17,160
that we do some coding together so

1077
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,359
that's a nice little 98 jig a little bit

1078
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,400
unusual uh what what key does it look

1079
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,720
like it's

1080
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,119
in yeah you always have to you can let

1081
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,440
let people give us chance to to do it

1082
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:32,359
yep major here and

1083
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,760
um and then we'll get a piece by the

1084
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:39,480
20th Century composer Arnold schernberg

1085
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:44,440
um schernberg

1086
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:48,440
Opus uh s h o n b r g slop

1087
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:50,799
us19 movement 6 all on word I know it's

1088
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,799
a little bit

1089
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:59,079
hard I wish I had another title that we

1090
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,079
can do it's a little piano

1091
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,000
piece great and Adam what key is it

1092
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,160
in no one

1093
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
knows okay

1094
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,319
um yeah so this is this is a rather

1095
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,960
ambiguous piece you know just just so

1096
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:19,530
you can get it a tiny bit in your ear um

1097
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:31,730
just the first couple chords

1098
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:31,730
[Music]

1099
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,839
there's something wrong on there's a

1100
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,839
cluff change

1101
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,240
missing yeah I know there's something a

1102
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,319
little bit wrong in in this encoding

1103
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,440
anyhow um little bit ambiguous ambiguous

1104
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:55,000
piece so what I want to do is let's get

1105
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,000
into uh unlocking some key analysis

1106
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
things

1107
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:07,839
so um what we can do is we we call it

1108
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:13,040
jig right yep K1 our first key will be K

1109
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:13,040
jig do analy analyze

1110
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,760
key so

1111
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,319
that's that's pretty good

1112
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:29,480
now in addition to analyzing key there's

1113
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:32,559
specific a number of people have um

1114
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,760
implemented their own analysis thing so

1115
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,280
we'll you'll have to get this so we're

1116
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,520
going to run through a bunch of

1117
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,720
different methods crom hunt the key the

1118
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,720
standard key

1119
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:52,920
method and um simple

1120
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:57,480
so key is something I put a guarantee to

1121
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:59,319
people using um using music 21 one that

1122
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,319
that will be whatever I think is giving

1123
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:04,000
the best results and I'll try to keep

1124
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:07,760
improving it and get that Crum huntel is

1125
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,960
exactly Carol k hunel um protone method

1126
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,920
with the exact same things there um

1127
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:15,119
which was learned it we learned the

1128
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,040
different weights the different amount

1129
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,480
um how important the tonic is how

1130
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,280
important the third is how important the

1131
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,319
fifth is and the key how did she learn

1132
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:28,319
that proone protone so that she was

1133
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:28,319
asking

1134
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:35,480
people just just getting people's um

1135
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:40,400
people's reaction to how far and out so

1136
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:43,319
it's based on cognition the essn um one

1137
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,920
was based on labeled keys for the entire

1138
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:48,920
Essen folk song Repertory which you've

1139
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,839
um we've used a couple times on things

1140
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,799
uh and it's come up in this class quite

1141
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:55,920
a bit and so people used that database

1142
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:59,440
on the ones that were labeled in the key

1143
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,359
to learn not from not from people but

1144
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,960
from um what number of notes were in a

1145
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:07,040
piece that was labeled as in F what

1146
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,000
number of things were labeled as an e

1147
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,319
and all of these weights by the way have

1148
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,520
these weird um numbers like you know the

1149
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:19,319
tonic 6.2

1150
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:22,280
38 make it too much like Pi 2 pi or

1151
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:25,920
something so these really long complex

1152
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:29,480
um complex numbers on on things like

1153
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,799
that um where Craig sap who's come up in

1154
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,799
this class A couple times for making the

1155
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:35,480
Rosetta Stone things I think it was

1156
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:37,640
Craig sap who came up with a very simple

1157
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:42,000
he's like no we we can we can just use

1158
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:44,400
one 1 01 .5 and I think everything in

1159
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,319
his waiting is either zero or .5 and

1160
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,920
he's like it's much easier to remember

1161
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,839
much easier to program and it works he

1162
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,160
thought uh even better so we have all

1163
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:58,559
these in here so we'll do this

1164
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:01,079
um here you don't need to know python F

1165
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,039
string formats but I'm going to give 20

1166
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:08,039
letters for the method and then we'll

1167
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:09,640
analyed using that method here actually

1168
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:13,839
we'll just do

1169
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:18,200
this key out I'll make this a little bit

1170
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:24,480
easier to read so we'll

1171
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:27,640
call Key out equals jig do analyze using

1172
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,640
the method

1173
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:38,079
oops method thank you I put method in a

1174
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,079
string I'm a string of

1175
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:45,160
methodists so when you put the jig into

1176
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,359
there everybody agrees it's D

1177
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:51,119
major that makes pretty good sense right

1178
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,880
you would not trust any algorithm that

1179
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,720
came up with a result other than D major

1180
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,760
for this entire piece this is the whole

1181
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,200
piece

1182
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,599
right but let's see what happens when we

1183
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,319
give it sherberg so I'm going to just

1184
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:05,839
copy and paste the copy and paste method

1185
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:08,880
for coding quickly in class and they

1186
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:12,920
call Se I

1187
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,960
think and here we end up with quite a

1188
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,960
bit of

1189
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,240
distinctions maybe E minor and a minor

1190
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,200
aren't too far apart but we even have a

1191
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,400
major key in there so depending on how

1192
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,760
you do your waiting different things

1193
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:31,160
could be better there's always the goal

1194
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:36,280
of trying to come up with a better key

1195
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:40,640
analysis routine and the other main uh

1196
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:42,760
unsolved uh task in this domain is

1197
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,200
pieces aren't always just in one key and

1198
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,559
I'm not talking about Charles eyeses

1199
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:49,039
with multi tonality and things talking

1200
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,559
about pieces change Keys throughout the

1201
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:53,799
piece and sometimes it's easy they

1202
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:55,599
change the key signature at that moment

1203
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:57,680
but quite often pieces change keys

1204
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,760
without giving key signature can you

1205
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,640
have a method that says well it begins

1206
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,920
in E and then it goes to a then it goes

1207
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,599
to C major and then it goes some other

1208
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,359
place can you detect where all those key

1209
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:11,720
changes are so that's something that

1210
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:15,640
people have worked on it a little bit

1211
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,640
but it's still an unsolved General

1212
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,599
problem anything um any questions on

1213
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:25,000
these types of

1214
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,559
things by the way you can you can

1215
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,280
there's a bunch of other things you can

1216
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:32,280
use uh on analyzing like you can get the

1217
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,760
pitch range and stuff like that

1218
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:38,720
but that works oh and I'll just say on

1219
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,480
this last one um key

1220
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:45,240
out.

1221
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,359
alternative was it I can never alt

1222
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:50,240
alternate

1223
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:52,680
interpretations gives you a list of so

1224
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,240
this is one C major gives you a list

1225
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,599
from the next most likely to by far are

1226
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,079
the least likely in fact let's do that

1227
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:04,319
on The Jig um we'll run The Jig one more

1228
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:07,079
time um what do we call it K1 yeah so K1

1229
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:12,559
is The Jig

1230
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:15,319
key and K1 to Al alternate

1231
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,319
interpretations yep so so if it's not in

1232
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:18,799
D Major it might be in B minor yeah it

1233
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:21,920
might be depending on what second

1234
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:23,880
section is very unlikely to be an A flat

1235
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,559
major

1236
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:29,839
okay um great with the last 10 minutes

1237
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:35,799
but I'm always happy to slow down

1238
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:40,760
questions come back talk no okay sure

1239
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:44,039
great so let's um let's get um what what

1240
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:47,400
we all want which is Roman

1241
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:49,799
numerals so go ahead and from music 21

1242
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,799
import

1243
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,640
Roman and try tring to find where I have

1244
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,400
this

1245
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,400
part broken

1246
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:11,319
up here we go okay within Roman

1247
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:13,520
um we can say RN equals roman. Roman

1248
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:15,000
numeral what are the two parts of a

1249
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,160
Roman numeral that computer's going to

1250
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,160
need in order

1251
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:26,799
to um in order to to figure out what

1252
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,799
pitches there are sorry

1253
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:33,400
the yep

1254
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:36,200
and yep we'll call that the figure the

1255
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:38,119
string representing things like one five

1256
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,280
things and the key so what you can do is

1257
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:43,960
if you had a key object I think we still

1258
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:47,200
have one K1 we can pass that

1259
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:49,319
in and get this four and D major the

1260
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,319
other thing what what we'll often do

1261
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:56,240
when we're coding in class is I'll just

1262
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:59,079
give it a capital D for D major low D

1263
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,039
would be D minor and that works just as

1264
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:03,240
well if you're actually writing a

1265
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:05,880
program unfortunately one of the least

1266
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,240
optimized things is creating a new key

1267
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,680
object it's about an order of magnitude

1268
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,359
slower than it should be in an idealized

1269
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:15,200
world so it is helpful to reuse your key

1270
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,400
object if you're going to keep using it

1271
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:21,440
over and over

1272
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:22,760
again okay so we have Roman numeral four

1273
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,240
in D

1274
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:28,319
Major somebody this side of the room

1275
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:32,720
what's what pitches are we going to be

1276
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:37,760
expecting Roman numeral 4 in D

1277
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:42,760
Major yep oh gbd gbd you g to say that

1278
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:44,960
good good so what we can do is uh

1279
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:48,960
gbd

1280
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,960
and what octave should they be

1281
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:54,720
in do that do that more gesturally so

1282
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,240
that we can get back you went doesn't

1283
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,160
matter it doesn't matter it doesn't

1284
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:02,920
matter right so there's this weird thing

1285
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:06,640
that happens that when we want to put a

1286
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:08,319
pitch onto um you know onto a staff or

1287
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,279
something we need to give it an octave

1288
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:12,279
we need to sort of rify at that moment

1289
01:02:10,279 --> 01:02:18,000
but it doesn't matter

1290
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:21,880
right so um here's the first question on

1291
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,480
on this is what kinds of when we say

1292
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:29,359
that um we have the same Roman numeral

1293
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:31,400
here as the same Roman numeral here what

1294
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,599
what kinds of equivalence classes are we

1295
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,559
talking

1296
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:39,400
about if I say that you know well Roman

1297
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:42,799
numeral four equals Roman numeral

1298
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:45,960
4 want to throw through some equivalence

1299
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,960
classes on pitches or

1300
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:53,240
notes somebody throw an easy one we just

1301
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,039
because we just said one octave octave

1302
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,480
good so that's definitely one

1303
01:02:56,039 --> 01:03:00,720
yeah go peration permutation yeah it

1304
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,160
doesn't really matter what order there

1305
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,480
uh there's I'll come back with octave on

1306
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,480
on just just a little bit because

1307
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:11,480
there's the caveat but later so everyone

1308
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:16,240
try to figure out caveat on that um what

1309
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:19,440
else cardinality right I mean is I

1310
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:24,480
almost wrote on that

1311
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,480
um yeah because

1312
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:33,079
this is one in C major but so is this

1313
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:36,279
and so is this and so is this doesn't

1314
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:38,640
really matter how many notes we have

1315
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:41,160
good now when we're just talking about

1316
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:44,160
uh Roman numeral like four what's the

1317
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:47,319
other thing that were that we sort of in

1318
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,920
in there for what do you think about

1319
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:53,319
yeah whether it's major or minor whether

1320
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:57,319
it's major or minor yep so we have

1321
01:03:53,319 --> 01:03:57,319
something on

1322
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:03,400
let's let's try to think some of these

1323
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:07,039
things and um do we have the the same

1324
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:08,240
blant um octave equivalent the one that

1325
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:13,200
we've been thinking of that you've

1326
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,200
already coded what's what's my caveat on

1327
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:21,680
octave yeah like chord inversion chord

1328
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:24,720
inversion yeah we have this this

1329
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:27,720
different kind of inversion where this

1330
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,720
is one

1331
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,640
and this

1332
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:38,359
is one first inversion one uh what is it

1333
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:41,920
1 a 1 B if you're um if you're British

1334
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:47,799
one six if you're American yep

1335
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:50,960
um yeah so we um we have we have this

1336
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:53,760
unusual um thing where which is very

1337
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,279
usual for us as musicians or as people

1338
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,760
have taken traditional class but a

1339
01:04:55,279 --> 01:05:01,880
little bit different for the um for that

1340
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,079
well the Octave of this doesn't matter

1341
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,319
in itself this could be you know we can

1342
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:13,000
move this up to sorry this like all over

1343
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:14,480
in the corner g e g c it's still one six

1344
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,400
so there's something about the octave

1345
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:21,960
that doesn't matter but there's sort of

1346
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:26,119
we don't have we might say uh

1347
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:28,279
base pitch equivalents so we always

1348
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:31,359
going to be creating new equivalence

1349
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:34,480
classes on things and so there's a very

1350
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:36,599
unusual equivalence class we also have a

1351
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,279
kind of limited

1352
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:45,480
transposition equivalence class right

1353
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:48,440
that I can write ceg and say it's one

1354
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,440
but I can also

1355
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:56,520
write D FSH a and call it one

1356
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:05,119
as long as I say that one is one in C

1357
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:08,839
major and one is one in D Major so that

1358
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:12,000
there's kind of this abstraction out of

1359
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:17,319
um that it's that transposition it's

1360
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,319
measured according to distance from what

1361
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:25,119
note not not not a note like C or

1362
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:27,839
something a conceptual note tonic yeah

1363
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:30,200
so we want to have things that are the

1364
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:32,760
difference from the tonic

1365
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:36,240
um so I think this might actually be

1366
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:37,520
different on yours than um than on mine

1367
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,279
because I'm running the beta version

1368
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,640
that I haven't still haven't got the

1369
01:06:39,279 --> 01:06:45,599
bugs out uh so you can see Roman numeral

1370
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,680
comes from some abstract class called

1371
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,440
Harmony which also represents chord

1372
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,839
symbols which I will not get to today

1373
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:55,160
and um and it comes from chord I think

1374
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:56,640
you're missing chord base probably for

1375
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:59,400
most people

1376
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,240
or maybe no it's there it's there okay

1377
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:06,079
great couldn't remember what version got

1378
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:09,920
that in great um so with our Roman

1379
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:12,400
numeral four we can get back its figure

1380
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,599
is four well that's you know not telling

1381
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,480
you too much let's get another one we'll

1382
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:17,039
call it

1383
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:20,079
rn1

1384
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:22,359
equals roman. Roman

1385
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:26,079
numeral flat

1386
01:07:22,359 --> 01:07:27,839
26 in C major what's another word for

1387
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,200
flat

1388
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:33,319
26 remember flat major

1389
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,079
26 don't worry if you don't know this

1390
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:37,200
because this is something that some

1391
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:40,279
people may know but it's the next

1392
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,279
semester beyond the prere

1393
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,079
yep it's traditionally taught the same

1394
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:48,000
week as augmented sixth CHT so everybody

1395
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:50,880
or the week before it

1396
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,160
uh that's a type of it's named after an

1397
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,160
emperor or no it's not it's named after

1398
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:58,319
City a Neapolitan cord uh so it's named

1399
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,960
not not Napoleon chord sorry named after

1400
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:03,480
the city of Naples um very very cool

1401
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,400
chord if we had two more minutes I would

1402
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:08,720
play it um so here's something here uh

1403
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:12,119
it's has a six at the end so what do we

1404
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:14,760
call it what's the

1405
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:19,640
inversion first inversion so you can

1406
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:23,080
call inversion and put it as uh one see

1407
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,960
it's a little bit strange that it has um

1408
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:29,000
inversion takes some time to calculate

1409
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:32,520
on very complex chords so it's uh method

1410
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,640
but we can get that it's Roman numeral

1411
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:37,719
alone this is a little bit wordy I

1412
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:41,199
should have come up with it thing is

1413
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:44,199
two and it's front

1414
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:44,199
alteration

1415
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:47,520
accidental is a

1416
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:57,440
flat so um that it's a two with a flat

1417
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:57,440
in front of it um

1418
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,520
so one of the things we can do just

1419
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:08,520
looking at the last moment let's we what

1420
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:12,400
you'll probably be wanting is Roman

1421
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:15,400
dot Roman numeral from chord so given a

1422
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:18,319
chord and a key what's the Roman numeral

1423
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:22,239
so uh we still have weird no we let's

1424
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:25,520
start with ch in C

1425
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:27,839
major my ceg is still there great what

1426
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:31,120
would that be in here let's just do this

1427
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:34,920
for for s

1428
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:37,520
in a b CDE e

1429
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:41,359
FG we'll print

1430
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:44,199
this print the Roman numeral in the as

1431
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,199
I'm using S for

1432
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:52,000
step does that make that make

1433
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:54,199
sense some odd odd chords in there right

1434
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,920
but you can figure out these types of

1435
01:09:54,199 --> 01:10:00,000
things here and so we get um we can even

1436
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,560
do roman. Roman numeral from chord I

1437
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,640
almost always when I'm using this a lot

1438
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:09,840
um abbreviate this so RN

1439
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:13,560
rnfc FC equals that so I can just do it

1440
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,560
romal from chord

1441
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,440
weird oops should give it a

1442
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:30,679
key here we go sharp one half diminished

1443
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:32,640
flat 7 6 flat 5 flat 3 um so music 21

1444
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:35,920
will try to find all these things for

1445
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,239
you um I've kept you over so I'm not

1446
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:43,840
going to uh show you how you can run

1447
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:46,520
this on every cord in a Bo piece put it

1448
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,960
as the dot lyric and then reshow the

1449
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:52,679
