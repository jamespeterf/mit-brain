1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,480
we've developed social robots to

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,880
interact and engage and support young

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,080
children in learning language and

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,000
literacy skills the children don't

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,040
actually understand that the robot is

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,840
modeling their behavior and adapting

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,119
what it does and the kind of scaffolding

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,279
they just see the robot as a fun

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,519
Playmate but really under the hood the

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,680
robot is learning what action to take at

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,400
each moment to really try to optimize

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,400
the learning and engagement of the child

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,800
that's playing these games with nice to

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,879
meet you

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,079
what is your name um

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,200
Alana of course we know that not every

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,039
child can have you know the luxury of a

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,719
personal tutor but potentially with our

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:47,399
artificial intelligence it's possible to

20
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,039
create scalable affordable effective uh

21
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,000
personalized learning experiences for

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,440
