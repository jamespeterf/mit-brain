1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,360
okay so today we're going to continue

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,199
our discussion of oligopoly you remember

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,560
last time we started by saying look

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,439
there's fundamentally when you have

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,199
multiple firms in a market there's two

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,080
ways they can behave they can cooperate

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,760
or not cooperate and we talked about

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,679
what happens when firms don't cooperate

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,160
and the basically how leads to worse

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,280
outcome for everybody involved because

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,480
the dominant strategy basically is a

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,000
prisoner

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,920
dilemma and but so obviously firms can

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,320
do better if they go into the market and

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,800
instead of competing they form a

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,879
cartel and the way to form a cartel is

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,520
quite SE simple in theory the firms

18
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,079
would get together they would say we're

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,320
going to act as if we're a monopoly

20
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,000
we're going to treat ourselves as one

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,079
firm at the end of the day we'll just

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,160
split the

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,320
money so we'll basically treat ourselves

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,920
as a monopoly for decision making and

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,479
we'll split the money at the end so for

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,840
example remember from last time we had a

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:18,360
a demand curve of the form P equal 339

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,360
minus q and your marginal cost of

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,720
147 okay and we solved this Monopoly

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,920
problem last time remember when American

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:30,119
was the only firm in the market the

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Monopoly solution was qal 96

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,920
P equals

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,759
243 okay that was the Monopoly

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,119
solution so the cartel case what firms

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,000
do is they each say look we want 96

37
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,240
flights total let's just each do 48

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,320
flights and let's split the profits so

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,880
what does each firm get well profits

40
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,560
what are profits profits are price minus

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,920
average cost times quantity well price

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,479
is

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,799
243 in this example average cost equals

44
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,240
marginal cost for the relevant range so

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,079
that's

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,239
147 times 96 flights total Market

47
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:14,800
profits are

48
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,800
9216 or alternatively each firm gets

49
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,239
4608 so that's when they cartelize

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,680
that's the profits they make price minus

51
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,239
average cost times quantity in our

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,840
example average cost equals marginal

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,599
cost so price minus marginal cost times

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,720
quantity gets you 9216 in total profits

55
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,080
are

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,120
4608 per firm compare that to the

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,440
profits each firm makes in the Cornell

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,239
equilibrium in the Cano equilibrium as

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,159
we solved last time under

60
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:51,680
Corno as we solved last time we found

61
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:54,000
that um the price um the price was they

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
charged

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:03,680
$211 okay uh minus 147 was their profits

64
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:07,680
per unit and they each did 64 flights so

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,680
their profits for each firm were

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,280
4,096 so profits are 20 or profits are

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,159
15% or 12.5%

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,840
higher if they if they

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,480
cize because they keep the price higher

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,680
they make more profits per unit so if

71
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,920
they caliz each firm's profits is 4608

72
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,400
rather than 4096

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,680
so Cooperative equilibria deliver a

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,040
better outcome they competive than

75
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,920
non-cooperative equilibria in in an

76
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,040
oligopolistic Market generally true once

77
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,640
again you'll learn in 1412 you learn fun

78
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,239
examples where that's not true but

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,840
generally true for this course it's true

80
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,239
now that raises the question why don't

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,120
all

82
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,319
oligopolistic markets feature

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,599
cartels and there's really two reasons

84
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,400
okay there's one that economists focus

85
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,879
on and one that lawyers focus on the one

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,280
that economists focus on is the

87
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,439
incentive based explanation which is

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,799
that cartels are fundamentally

89
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,120
unstable they're unstable in the same

90
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,680
way that the prison's dilemma creates

91
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,160
instability which is the person's

92
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,479
dilemma I can only solve it if I really

93
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,040
truly trust you if I'm afraid you're

94
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,280
going to rat on me then I'll rat on you

95
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,840
it's the same in the cartel there's an

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,639
incentive to cheat and that's because

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,479
when you cheat I'll show you

98
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,600
mathematically when you cheat you get

99
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,759
all the benefit but only bear half the

100
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,280
cost what I mean by that well let's show

101
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,199
you what I mean by that imagine that

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,720
American quietly without telling youai

103
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,240
they've agreed to this equilibrium

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,880
they're each going to fly 48 flights and

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,840
they're each going to make

106
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,120
4608 Now American without telling United

107
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,840
says you know I'm going to do 50 flights

108
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm gonna up my number of flights to 50

109
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,840
well the only way American can do that

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,280
given the downward sling demand covers

111
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,639
by the price coming down so if the if

112
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,600
American does 50 flights that raise the

113
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,800
total to

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,199
98 so if American cheats and does 50

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,680
flights then the price goes

116
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,400
to then big quantity goes to 98 so the

117
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,440
price Falls from 243 to

118
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,319
241 the price has to fall if you're

119
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,199
going to sell 98 flights instead of 96

120
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,880
flights okay what does American make in

121
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,800
profits well the profit for

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,479
American are

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:42,160
241 minus 147 * 50 because they're doing

124
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,840
50 flights now okay that's their new

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,080
profits okay and so the price is falling

126
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,199
but they're flying 50 flights and so

127
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,759
they get new profits of

128
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,680
4700 their profits have gone up by

129
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,720
cheating what's United's profits well I

130
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,759
think you know the answer United's

131
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,280
prophets gone down what's profits United

132
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,440
well they're it's

133
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,960
241 minus 147 but they're still only

134
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:14,759
doing 48

135
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:18,000
flights okay so their profits fall to

136
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,599
4512 4512 sorry this just got compressed

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,400
so price is

138
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:28,039
241 cost is 147 they're still doing 48

139
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,560
flights 241 - 147 * 48 is

140
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,280
4512 so by

141
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,599
cheating America has raised their

142
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,800
profits but lowered the profits of

143
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:40,319
United and if you do the math United's

144
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,319
profits have

145
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,280
fallen by as much as Americans have gone

146
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,319
up and but the total profits in the

147
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,120
market have shrunk look at the total

148
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,560
profits in the market now total profits

149
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,879
in the market are now

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,599
9212 instead of

151
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:02,240
9216 you do 4512 plus 4700 you get 922

152
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,440
12 total profits have fall in the market

153
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,800
why because they didn't do the op the

154
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,639
Monopoly

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
solution but they fall in a way that

156
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,680
makes American better off and United

157
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,680
worse off what's going on what's going

158
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,280
on is aversion of the poisoning effect

159
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,400
remember the reason the when they're a

160
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,400
monopolis they wouldn't raise the

161
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,039
quantity to 98 is the poisoning

162
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,639
effect but when American raises its

163
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,639
quantity it gets all the benefit of a

164
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,199
higher quantity but spreads the

165
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,319
poisoning effect with

166
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,120
United you know those Americans get all

167
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,479
the benefit going to 50

168
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,800
flights but the poisoning effect gets

169
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,960
shared with United the lower price so

170
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,280
America is incentive to cheat because by

171
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,400
cheating you get all the benefits only

172
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,680
pay half the

173
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,919
costs and that's why cartels are

174
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,960
unstable because basically cartels

175
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,080
feature a version of what we call the

176
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,159
public goods problem which is whenever

177
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,199
my action delivers benefits not only to

178
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,000
you to me but to

179
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,520
you then I might not behave in the favor

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,800
that was best for both of us and we'll

181
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,080
come back to that later in the semester

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,479
but it's my action by limiting my

183
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
quantity if I'm American by limiting to

184
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:16,440
48 I benefit not only me but you so for

185
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,199
by cheating and going to 50 I benefit me

186
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,680
and we share the costs and therefore

187
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,240
it's a better thing to do so our our

188
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,120
cartel is fundamentally unstable because

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,199
any actor in the cartel can make more

190
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,879
money by

191
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:34,120
deviating okay does that make

192
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,519
sense now the lawyers would saywell you

193
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,599
Economist and your stupid math you can't

194
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,519
even write in the board it's all

195
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,880
squished let's just come to a second

196
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,200
reason why we don't like cartels which

197
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,800
we don't have cartels which is they're

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,680
illegal cartels are illegal so basically

199
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,399
um in the late 1800s cartels were common

200
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,680
this is the way much of major industry

201
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
organized itself from oil to Railroad

202
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,720
Industries this is called the a of the

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,959
robber barons or the Gilded Age there

204
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
were giant families like the

205
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,800
Rockefellers and the vand builts that

206
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,600
basically cariz giant Industries like

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,279
oil and

208
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,640
railroad okay now how did they enforce

209
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,320
this how do they enforce this well they

210
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,360
the lawyers for Standard Oil I forget

211
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,320
which family that is if that's

212
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,040
Rockefellers or Vanderbilts one it's

213
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,279
Rockefellers lawyers for Standard Oil

214
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,279
said

215
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,120
basically we're going to create what

216
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,120
we're going to call a

217
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,440
trust and the way this trust is going to

218
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,399
work is all firms in the industry will

219
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,200
agree to turn over their pricing and

220
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,360
production decisions to a common board

221
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,839
or trust and that common trust will make

222
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,440
the industrywide pricing and quantity

223
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,360
decisions and then we'll split

224
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
it so basically now you still could

225
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,079
cheat but they tried to set up a

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
non-cheating mechanism by having the

227
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,519
sort of objective mechanism that was

228
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,399
outside them that got to decide and then

229
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,600
monitored how much oil they sold and uh

230
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,839
what price they

231
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,640
got okay now this was wi this is in the

232
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,440
open this wasn't secret they said were

233
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,800
forming this trust and that led to a big

234
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,680
backlash in the creation of what you

235
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,920
might have heard of is the

236
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,880
antitrust movement and the development

237
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,640
of antitrust law antitrust law is

238
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,720
basically

239
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,600
anti-cartel rules and regulations rules

240
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,720
and regulations to try to break down

241
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,920
cartels now lawyers would say we have

242
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,160
these so who cares about the economic

243
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,640
incent well the answer is because the

244
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,440
reason economists care about economic

245
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,600
incentives more than laws or as least as

246
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,440
much as laws is because the laws don't

247
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,120
always

248
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
work okay so let me give you a couple

249
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,920
examples one example is the Hollywood

250
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,680
movie

251
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,959
industry so basically um the industry

252
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,880
the Holly M industry has long been

253
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,959
dominated by a few big firms the firms

254
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,519
have changed a little bit over time but

255
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,320
it's MGM you know Fox a

256
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:02,279
Warner and these films produce firms

257
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,399
these firms produce films and sell them

258
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,760
to movie theaters and movie theaters

259
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,360
then show a variety of movies you know

260
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,360
the Megaplex all the movies they're

261
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,160
showing in the 1930s and 40s these firms

262
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,040
started buying up the movie

263
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,639
theaters and when they buy the movie

264
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
theaters they'd say we this is now a

265
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,040
Warner movie theater it can only show

266
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,480
Warner

267
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:27,320
Movies so it essentially created this uh

268
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,120
cart this anti-competitive practice

269
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,000
where it would not let movie theaters

270
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,320
bid against each other for movies they

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
would just say look if you're a Warner

272
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,600
movie theater you only show Warner

273
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,959
movies and therefore MGM movies couldn't

274
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,120
compete in certain markets that allow so

275
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,519
let's say you're the one movie theater

276
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,320
in town you're a Warner movie theater

277
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,320
you can charge whatever you want because

278
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,360
there's no MGM movie to compete with it

279
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,800
if want see MJ you got to go to the next

280
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,360
town so this is exactly kind of

281
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,600
anti-competitive practice that antitrust

282
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,880
laws are designed to break up and they

283
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,000
did but sometimes it's harder because

284
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,440
they're less out in the open so let's

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
take the case of

286
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,079
Airlines uh in the early 2000 oil prices

287
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,880
went

288
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,399
up and Airlines started adding oil

289
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,360
search charges so rather is raising

290
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,800
their prices your ticket for the airline

291
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,959
would say here's your price and here's

292
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,120
your oil search charge because oil

293
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,360
prices have gone

294
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:24,199
up okay in 2004 British Airways and

295
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,120
Virgin Atlantic were the two dominant

296
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,279
airlines flying across the

297
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,440
Atlantic and they met in secret and

298
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,320
reached a

299
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,880
deal and their deal was that they would

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,480
coordin in a coordinated way jack up the

301
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,079
oil charges and the oil charges went

302
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,279
from $10 to $120 a

303
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,600
ticket and they agreed they wouldn't

304
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,519
undercut the other person because they

305
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,360
weren't really able to charge at that

306
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,760
point they were just higher prices just

307
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,800
an excuse that prices have gone up and

308
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,279
they basically said look we won't

309
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,680
undercut each other we'll have a cartel

310
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,800
the cartel instead of coordinating on

311
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,199
the explicit price to take will

312
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,440
coordinate on this bonus part of the

313
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,040
price something economists often call a

314
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,000
shrouded attribute an extra part of the

315
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,519
price you don't pay attention to

316
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,920
Consumers won't notice as much because

317
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,800
they're less price elastic to these sort

318
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,839
of hidden parts of costs and we won't

319
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,480
undercut each other make a lot of

320
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,720
money so basically um they got this deal

321
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,320
at worked but here's once again why

322
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,920
economistic incentives matter the

323
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,720
lawyers for Virgin Airline caught wind

324
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,199
of what their Executives had agreed

325
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,120
to and the lawyer said you know what if

326
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:35,040
if British Airways ever ever says ever

327
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,360
tells what we're doing to The Regulators

328
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,519
British Airways will get away with it

329
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,440
and we'll be screwed so what did they

330
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,120
do they went to The Regulators because

331
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,320
it's an end it's it's a repeated game

332
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,240
with an end they knew that at some point

333
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,800
someone was going to cheat so it might

334
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,480
as well someone's going to break it up

335
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,839
it might as well be them they did they

336
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,920
went to the regulars reported the scheme

337
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,360
got a slap on the wrist and British

338
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,959
Airways got an enormous

339
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,720
fine uh virgin Airway paid nothing

340
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:06,360
British Airways paid $500

341
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,000
million okay so this instability is not

342
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,639
just mathematical it's just generally a

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,800
feature of why cooperation is hard

344
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,639
cooperation requires trust and

345
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,959
consistency and that's hard between

346
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,759
natural

347
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,800
competitors it's hard to make that

348
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,880
happen so that's you know cartel

349
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
instability the laws help but here was

350
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,680
something they were getting around the

351
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,160
law what broke it up was not the law

352
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,720
what broke it up was

353
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,120
incentives so Economist trust incentives

354
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,639
over the law okay now there's a third

355
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,440
example which is quite interesting which

356
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,120
is sometimes cartels can operate in the

357
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,079
open and get away with it let's talk

358
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,600
about the National Football League the

359
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,800
NFL the NFL is the most important

360
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,120
football organization in America the

361
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,839
most profitable important football

362
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,720
organization in America football's the

363
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,399
most profitable uh sport in the country

364
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,880
adver advertising is incredibly valuable

365
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,600
leing football games increasingly so

366
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
because now we all watch it's the one

367
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,279
place in the world you don't

368
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,399
stream so we stream everything we watch

369
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,320
now so we don't have ads you can't

370
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,759
stream Sports so Sports advertising has

371
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,399
gone through the roof because

372
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,800
advertising in other context is less

373
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,959
valuable used to be could advertise

374
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,279
everywhere now you can't it's really

375
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,759
just Sports at the last place people

376
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:26,720
watch ads so it's incredibly valuable

377
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:29,000
now the NFL is 32 teams essentially 32

378
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,480
businesses competing in a literal sense

379
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,199
with each

380
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,639
other so this and there's a huge

381
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,519
incentive to

382
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,600
collude let's take the New York Giants

383
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,839
and the New York Jets and you know the

384
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,680
New Jersey Giant New York Jets but it's

385
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,800
the same same

386
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,920
Market let's say that they both let's

387
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,800
say the TV station says the major TV

388
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,279
station says look we're going to

389
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,759
broadcast whichever team gives us the

390
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,720
better deal well the Giants and jets

391
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,040
will have to compete with each other

392
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,319
give the TV station a better de deal

393
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,279
let's say they look we'll agree not to

394
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:06,600
do that we'll just tell the TV station

395
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,920
this is our price it's 2 m you know

396
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,480
basically instead of a billion dollars

397
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,079
it'll be2 billion dollar we each have $2

398
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,720
billion dollar either take it or leave

399
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,279
it and TV station end up broadcasting

400
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,959
both or maybe one TV station takes one

401
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,120
another TV station takes

402
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:21,800
another and more generally what the NFL

403
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,399
does is they only sell the TV rights for

404
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,519
the league they don't sell TV rights for

405
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,720
individual teams so individual teams do

406
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,759
not sell their TV rights which could

407
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,600
lead to competition the league just

408
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,839
sells the TV rights which causes a

409
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,959
cartel essentially they're saying if you

410
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,880
want to broadcast football you got to

411
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,360
come to us and we're only going to we're

412
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,240
going to charge a super high price as a

413
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,959
result quite frankly watching football

414
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,399
is a bit of a pain in the ass at this

415
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,040
point so you've got Network TV which if

416
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
the local team is on you can only watch

417
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,319
the local

418
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
team otherwise there may be one other

419
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:57,079
game

420
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,079
on you've got Sunday Night Football

421
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,440
which is on network TV you we got

422
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,400
Thursday Night Football which I think is

423
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:07,160
on Amazon or ESPN Amazon Thursday night

424
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,319
who's got Thursday Night Football am

425
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,839
Amazon you've got Sunday morning

426
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,120
football from London which is ESPN

427
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,720
plus then you can do what I did in Pony

428
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,959
up $350 to buy Sunday ticket if you like

429
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,520
an out of town team you want to watch

430
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,000
your team which lets you watch any game

431
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,039
you want on Sunday except the Sunday

432
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,880
morning games where you still have to

433
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,199
buy ESPN plus as I learned much to my

434
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,440
chrin so it's incredibly expensive to

435
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,400
watch football

436
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,840
if you want to see all the football

437
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
games it cost you a pretty penny why

438
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,760
because the league is colluded and set

439
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,080
up a structure where basically firms

440
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,480
can't undercut each otherwi firms and

441
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
say look a lot of people want my team

442
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm going to go strike a separate

443
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,520
deal indeed in

444
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,880
1957 the Supreme Court 1957 even before

445
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,039
I was born that's how long ago it was

446
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,320
the Supreme Court ruled that this was

447
00:17:54,039 --> 00:18:01,039
anti-competitive and they couldn't do

448
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,440
it they did yet it's still done and the

449
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,240
NFL will make $40 billion this year off

450
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,039
their collusive

451
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,080
cartel

452
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,280
why because Congress stepped in and said

453
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,720
well we're going to grant them an

454
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,320
Anti-Trust exemption we're going to say

455
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,200
football is such of a national important

456
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,320
priority that we're going to actually

457
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,480
exempt football from our nation's

458
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,360
antitrust laws so I said last time in my

459
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,039
previous lecture I'd prove to you that

460
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,840
Congress cares more about football than

461
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,280
economics

462
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,159
okay they cared more about the football

463
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,240
league than actually making football

464
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,120
affordable for us to watch so by

465
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,039
granting them antitrust exemption they

466
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,679
allowed them to collude and have this

467
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,559
one League that makes it incredibly

468
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,400
expensive to watch

469
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,679
football okay questions about

470
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,120
that one other fun example um we're

471
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,280
going to discuss international trade in

472
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,400
a few lectures we'll it's really

473
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,240
interesting topic we'll spend some time

474
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,600
on it but the bottom line is economists

475
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,360
generally feel free international trade

476
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,000
is is a good thing we'll come back to

477
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,080
subtleties but roughly speaking We

478
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,919
Believe free Inter National trade is a

479
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,679
good thing and for years that was

480
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
reflected in the views of the Republican

481
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,480
Party the Republican party was a party

482
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
of free trade Democrats were the party

483
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,320
of less free trade okay that's changed

484
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,799
over time but that was the traditional

485
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,080
when I was a kid there was the free

486
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,720
trade party and the less free trade

487
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,919
party okay Ronald Reagan you don't get

488
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,840
more Republican than Ronald Reagan

489
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,320
Ronald Reagan in 1981 faced a problem

490
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,360
which is Japan was starting to make cars

491
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,919
that americ Americans like more than

492
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,320
americanmade cars and Japan was killing

493
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,559
us in the car market they were people

494
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
Americans were buying Japanese cars

495
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,039
instead of American cars and the US

496
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,880
autom manufacturers mad they said you

497
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,240
should limit how many japanese cars come

498
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,720
in and Reagan said I'm a free trade

499
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,120
Republican I can't do that or at least I

500
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,640
can't appear to be doing that so what

501
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,000
did they do they said I'll tell you what

502
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,360
we're going to negotiate a deal we're

503
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,559
going to call a voluntary export

504
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,760
restraint a Veer we're gonna say to

505
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,720
Japan look you can do what you want

506
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,080
okay but we're going to ask you to limit

507
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,919
how many cars you sell in

508
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,520
America we're going to say let's say

509
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,400
you're selling two million cars a year

510
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,159
we're goingon to ask you to limit to one

511
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,360
and a half million a year we're not

512
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,640
telling you I'm free trade we're just

513
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:22,080
asking you why did Japan

514
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:24,440
agree why did Japanese automakers

515
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,600
agree to reduce how many cars they sell

516
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,600
in

517
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,440
America I mean it's not geopolitics it's

518
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,440
economics

519
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,039
yeah yeah it's essentially the US celiz

520
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,640
the Japanese Auto industry we basically

521
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,120
said we won't let you compete your price

522
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,039
down remember I talked about government

523
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,400
can fix Monopoly by regulating a low

524
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,200
price this is government regulating a

525
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,640
high

526
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,720
price regulating a low quantity so it

527
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
basically japanes said sure you're

528
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,440
basically our companies we the companies

529
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,679
would love to compete less we just can't

530
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,000
do it so you are basically enforcing

531
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,240
calization on us you're enforcing the

532
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,760
fact we can't drive the price down of

533
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,360
our cars thank you very much the

534
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,159
estimates are that as a result of this

535
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,520
deal the average Japanese car price in

536
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:15,200
the US Rose by

537
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,279
14% And us consumers the best estimat

538
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,080
are lost $3 billion do in consumer

539
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,880
surplus for the fact they couldn't buy

540
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,000
cheap Japanese cars they

541
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,480
wanted so these are all examples of

542
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,400
different ways calization can happen

543
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,799
it's hard governments can play both a

544
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,520
constructive and destructive

545
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:39,039
role okay questions about any of

546
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,279
that okay so what I want to do now is I

547
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,480
want to do a little comparison between

548
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,640
the models let's compare the models

549
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,640
we've now covered three models we've

550
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,400
covered perfect

551
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,080
competition Monopoly and oligopoly at

552
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,279
least the Coro and once again I've said

553
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,400
this a million times I'm sorry to bore

554
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,559
you but the Coro Cas is the very tip of

555
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,159
the iceberg there's a million other

556
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:02,360
interesting cases you can learn about

557
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:06,000
1412 okay let's look at what each of

558
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:09,000
these three cases imply so we have

559
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,039
Monopoly we have perfect competition I'm

560
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,240
sorry we have

561
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,919
oligopoly by which we mean

562
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,200
Corno and then we have perfect

563
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,159
competition okay let's see what these

564
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,159
these imply for the quantity

565
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:26,360
produced and what they imply for profits

566
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,360
per

567
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,240
firm okay well we know that if they

568
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,480
monopolize the market quantity is

569
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,880
96 and the profits for firm Are

570
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,600
4608 I solv that up

571
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,440
above we know from up here that if they

572
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,799
don't monopolize each firm produces 64

573
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,559
we solved that Coro problem last time so

574
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:55,600
the market quantity is

575
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:59,360
128 and the profits are for

576
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,159
4,096 or 12.5% cheaper

577
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,840
I solved that up

578
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:04,840
there what about perfect

579
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,000
competition what is the quantity sold in

580
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,039
this market in a perfect competition

581
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
everything you need to answer that

582
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:15,000
question is at the very top of the top

583
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,200
board what is the quantity sold in this

584
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,120
market in perfect

585
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,120
competition

586
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,679
yeah 192 and how'd you get

587
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,200
that right price equals marginal cost is

588
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,000
the key condition for perfect

589
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,360
competition good answer price equals

590
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
marginal cost cost is the foundation

591
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,919
perfect competition that means the price

592
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,919
is 147 that means the quantity by the

593
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,919
demand curve is 192 same person what are

594
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:47,400
profits price is

595
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:51,200
147 well price is 147 what's

596
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,679
cost 147 zero perfect competition leads

597
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,679
to zero

598
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,960
profits so this is a really important

599
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,400
table because look what you see as the

600
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,320
market gets more

601
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,840
competitive more units are sold and

602
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,320
profits

603
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:12,400
fall more units are sold and profits

604
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,880
fall okay and the general feature you

605
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,240
get generally true the oligopoly case

606
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,960
will lie between the Monopoly and

607
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,159
perfectly competitive case that's

608
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,760
generally true okay we get sort of bound

609
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,039
the outcome by the Monopoly perfect

610
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,919
competitive Cas alop case will be

611
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,880
somewhere in

612
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,360
between okay questions about this why

613
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,640
this lines up the way it

614
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:37,760
does what does this mean for

615
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,000
welfare well we could go through and you

616
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,600
asked to do some of this last night and

617
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,679
calculate the producer consumer surplus

618
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,000
for each of these

619
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,440
cases okay but you get a long night I

620
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,640
won't make you do that I'm going to

621
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,840
teach a shortcut now that you wish I

622
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,120
taught you yesterday Monday okay the

623
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,480
shortcut is remember what causes dead

624
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
weight

625
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,880
loss trades that are beneficial to both

626
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,480
sides that are not made or in other

627
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,960
words deviations from perfect

628
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,720
competition so we know the answer that

629
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,559
this must be the highest welfare outcome

630
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,000
because we know from the First

631
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,520
Fundamental welfare

632
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,600
theorem that this maximizes

633
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:20,279
welfare guess what the size of the Dead

634
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,080
weight loss is proportional to the

635
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,480
quantity in other words the more you

636
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,000
shrink the market from the optimal level

637
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,120
the bigger the dead weight loss the more

638
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,640
trades that don't get made cuz look the

639
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,360
structure of the problem these first two

640
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,399
equations okay these are the same the

641
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,919
structure of problem has not

642
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,360
changed so as you shrink quantity all

643
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,640
you're do is creating more and more dead

644
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,960
weight

645
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,399
loss because dead weight loss is about

646
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,440
trades that aren't made that would be

647
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:53,520
beneficial any trade at a price above

648
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,919
147 is

649
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,600
beneficial any any ticket bought in an

650
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,320
airline at a price price above 147 is

651
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,679
beneficial because it wouldn't be bought

652
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,799
if the consumer didn't want it and it's

653
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,279
above

654
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,480
cost so as the quantity Falls as the

655
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,679
price rise above 147 the quality Falls

656
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,120
below

657
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,000
192 welfare is going

658
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,039
down total social welfare is going down

659
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,960
producer Surplus is going up but

660
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,840
consumer surplus is falling

661
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,600
faster okay because dead weight loss is

662
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,880
proportional to

663
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,559
quantity the more you R quantity from

664
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,520
the perfectly competitive case the

665
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,600
bigger the dead weight loss you

666
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,640
create okay the more you restrict

667
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,120
quantity per competitive case the more

668
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:45,240
trades that aren't made that are

669
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,240
beneficial okay questions about

670
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,320
that okay that's one point I want to

671
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,000
make the second point I want to make is

672
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,919
I want to talk about what happens when

673
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,919
you have many firms

674
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,440
what happens when you have many

675
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,399
firms well we've talked about one firm

676
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,480
Monopoly we've talked about essentially

677
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:12,120
infinite firms which is perfect

678
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,240
competition we've talked about two firms

679
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,720
which is Corno what about three four

680
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,840
five six seven eight firms what about

681
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,240
ends that are between zero and

682
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,799
infinity well it turns out and you could

683
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,919
sort of see this here that the Cano

684
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,720
equilibrium approaches perfect

685
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,919
competition as the number of firms goes

686
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,720
to

687
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:37,159
Infinity the oligopoly model approaches

688
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,360
the perfectly competitive model as the

689
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,320
number of firms goes to Infinity as the

690
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,360
number of firms goes towards one it

691
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,399
approaches a monopoly model olop covers

692
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,080
this whole Space depending on the number

693
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,880
of

694
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,840
firms okay and in particular you can

695
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
derive this but you don't have to the

696
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,240
markup that you get in oligopolistic

697
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,799
Market is minus one Over N time Epsilon

698
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,240
the elasticity demand remember the

699
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,360
marker for monopolies was this without

700
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,240
the N you tested on that last night that

701
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,840
was the markup without without oligopoly

702
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,559
and Monopoly when you add oligopoly all

703
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,519
you do is add the N to that

704
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,320
denominator all you do is add the end to

705
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,720
that

706
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:22,240
denominator and so basically the markup

707
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,399
Falls in alistic market for two

708
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,919
reasons one is as the number of firms

709
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,360
get large the Prof the markup up Falls

710
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,360
and thus the profits fall the other is

711
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,120
the elocity of demand gets large just

712
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,480
like we talked about Monopoly the

713
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,279
profits fall the markup Falls so what

714
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,799
constrains an oligopolist an oligopolist

715
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:43,440
in this model is both how many firms

716
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,519
they're competing with and how elastic

717
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,279
the demand is for the

718
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,919
good

719
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:55,519
okay

720
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:56,840
so that but it's not only that n has

721
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,080
sort of this is sort of the direct

722
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,480
effect of n there's an indirect effect

723
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,720
of more firms too indirect effect the

724
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,799
indirect effect is it's harder to have a

725
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,120
cartel the more players there are so n

726
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,159
going up not only lowers profits because

727
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,600
through this mechanical mechanism n up

728
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,679
lowers profits because it breaks

729
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,360
possibilities for Cooperative equilibria

730
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,080
so for example um for a long time the

731
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,000
only two countries that sold Mercury on

732
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,360
the World Market were Italy and Spain

733
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,039
Mercury like is in lots of stuff okay

734
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,519
Italy and Spain and they formed a cartel

735
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,600
and they successfully kept pric up like

736
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:34,039
OPEC does for oil now but then other

737
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,120
nations in particular Russia started

738
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,559
producing Mercury and the cartel broke

739
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,159
down because they couldn't they didn't

740
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,799
trust those damn Russians and they

741
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:44,559
couldn't form a coalition and the cartel

742
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,360
broke down so the other reason n matters

743
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,519
is not just mechanical reason but the

744
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,559
sort of logistical reason that cartels

745
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:53,080
get harder the bigger end

746
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,279
gets and then this raises the last thing

747
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,200
this raises is how do we think about

748
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:02,440
government policy in olop

749
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,240
markets and in particular a very rich

750
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:09,159
Arab government policy is Anti-Trust

751
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,120
policy okay this is a hugely topical

752
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,320
issue some of you may be reading about

753
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,120
the Google case that's going on right

754
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,039
now where mit's own Mike Winston is the

755
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,240
key expert witness for the government my

756
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,279
colleague is the key expert for the

757
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,600
government in the Google case what's the

758
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,600
Google case the Google case is that

759
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Google has

760
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,760
monopolized the market for search

761
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:31,240
engines which we all sort of know right

762
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,519
we Google things we don't Bing them okay

763
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,880
so basically it just it's easier to say

764
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,440
I'm going to go Duck Duck Go something

765
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,159
which just sound weird right Googling

766
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,559
and they they have the linguistic

767
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,960
Advantage as well and part of the reason

768
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,559
they do that that came out in this trial

769
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,279
is that they pay Apple 10 billion dollar

770
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,399
a

771
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:52,120
year 10 billion a year to make Google

772
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,760
the default search engine on

773
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,240
iPhones and we're all subject to default

774
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,600
bias we all just goes what the defaults

775
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,679
are I mean you can always switch or

776
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,519
search gention but no one

777
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,600
does and the key question this trial is

778
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,600
does Google have 98% more 92% market

779
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,720
share because they've paid off the

780
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,320
companies to make them default or

781
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,279
because they're better Google's just

782
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,440
saying look we're better search

783
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,720
engine you you wouldn't penalize a

784
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,720
company for being better if we're better

785
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,600
we should get more market share and

786
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,240
that's absolutely true and that's the

787
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,600
incredible difficult part about this

788
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:30,039
case is the judge has to

789
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,720
decide does Google have 90% market share

790
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:35,519
fairly by just being a better search

791
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,600
engine or unfairly by paying off Apple

792
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,639
so no other search engines get a

793
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,679
chance this is an incredibly exciting

794
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,399
area of Economics the even bigger cases

795
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,200
coming the Google's just a warm-up

796
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:51,039
because what's coming next okay is the

797
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,600
app is is it Apple Amazon I forget which

798
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,760
is the next big one Amazon's the next

799
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,919
book one right so

800
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,919
Amazon Amazon right of course when you

801
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,360
go on Amazon of course it's Amazon you

802
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,080
can buy stuff from Amazon from Amazon

803
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,519
Marketplace about 40% of stuff that's

804
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,320
sold on Amazon is sold on Amazon

805
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,320
Marketplace which is other vendors that

806
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,559
come to Amazon and sell on their

807
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,480
platform because it's great because you

808
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,679
just you know you Google search engine

809
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,919
you Amazon shopping right when you want

810
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:16,960
to shop you go and then therefore if

811
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,919
Amazon doesn't sell you find these

812
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,760
vendors turns out Amazon charges these

813
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,480
vendors enormous

814
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,960
amounts Amazon takes something like a

815
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,320
quarter of the profits they make some

816
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,679
huge amount and they do all of things

817
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,919
like making them pay fees they L where

818
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,760
they're listed on the list they have to

819
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,240
pay more to be hir in the list

820
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,880
Etc and the government is suing saying

821
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,200
that that is antitrust Behavior because

822
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
we don't have a competitive market for

823
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,000
these firms since Amazon dominates

824
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,240
online

825
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
search as Amazon dominates online search

826
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,679
they have a dominant position to

827
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,639
monopolize the ability of firms to sell

828
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,480
their

829
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:56,559
goods well what's the counterargument

830
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,960
well the government's going to say look

831
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,960
at the data Amazon has more than 50% of

832
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,600
the entire online shopping market is

833
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,360
Amazon they're they effectively dominate

834
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,600
the market Amazon's goingon to say

835
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,159
where's something like 8% of the entire

836
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,159
market for goods in

837
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,440
America why should you only consider us

838
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,480
competing with online things we also

839
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,720
compete with The Gap we compete with

840
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,120
brick and mortar

841
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,440
too why should we why should you say we

842
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,720
dominate just because we dominate online

843
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,960
these these little these little folks

844
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,080
who advertise on us could always just go

845
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,320
sell in the gap or sell in brick and

846
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,720
mortar as well

847
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,799
what's the right answer that's going to

848
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,760
be a hard thing a judg is going to have

849
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:36,360
to decide but that's why this is an

850
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,840
incredibly exciting and interesting area

851
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,159
and you found this interesting my

852
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,760
colleague Nancy Rose worked for the

853
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,440
government she was a government's Chief

854
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,120
Economist doing exactly this for two

855
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,399
years and she's teaching 1420 and she

856
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,840
teach you all about how this works and

857
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,080
the exciting cases and how governments

858
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,559
think about this but it's a very hard

859
00:33:53,080 --> 00:34:00,200
and exciting topic and obviously very

860
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,600
topical okay and one thing that this

861
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,960
does that's sort of more personal relev

862
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,440
to my research is think about Hospital

863
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,079
mergers so basically if two hospitals

864
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,040
want to

865
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:14,040
merge the benefit is there could be cost

866
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,960
efficiencies so two hospitals are across

867
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,919
the street from each other and they want

868
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,159
to merge they could be cost efficients

869
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,800
they could share resources they could

870
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,639
shrink the number of beds maybe so they

871
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,800
don't have so much excess capacity Etc

872
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,320
on the other hand they get more Market

873
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,879
power so the typical antitrust case

874
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,280
unlike these Amazon and Google cases

875
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,879
which are very exciting right now the

876
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,240
typical trust case is a little more

877
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,359
mundane which is when two firms merge

878
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,280
it's a trade-off between efficiencies of

879
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,839
merging returns to economies of

880
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,679
scale versus Market

881
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,520
power and essentially what you have to

882
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:48,240
do is evaluate which of those dominates

883
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,720
so for Hospital mergers for decades we

884
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,800
let Hospital mergers go on we just said

885
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,599
yeah whatever Hospital want to merge we

886
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,839
let them merge we said look this just

887
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,440
huge efficiency of scale turns out we

888
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,960
were totally wrong when hospitals merged

889
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,920
they don't get efficient at all they

890
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,079
just raise

891
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,119
prices they could get more efficient but

892
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,800
they don't they just raise prices so now

893
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,160
we're starting to crack down in hospital

894
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,320
mergers but that's exactly once again

895
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,640
the kind of interesting example we talk

896
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,240
about in this field

897
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,119
okay now let me go to the last topic

898
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,480
which I should have it you know uh

899
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,800
prepped you for more last time because

900
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,839
it related to some of the questions I

901
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,400
got which is I got a lot of questions

902
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:28,000
roughly of the form why do firms have to

903
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,000
set the same prices we don't think of

904
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,400
firms as competing on quantity we think

905
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,280
of firms competing on price you've got

906
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,079
this weird model where American and

907
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,520
United compete by deciding how many

908
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,079
flights to have that's not how firms

909
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,480
compete they compete by setting their

910
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,160
price and so you were saying that

911
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,839
quantity competition is right not the

912
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,839
right model price competition is the

913
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,760
right model so now let's go to analyzing

914
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,400
oligopoly in alternative world where

915
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,720
firms don't compete on quantity and let

916
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,000
the market decide price they compete on

917
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,440
price and let the Market side

918
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,920
quantity here we move from the Corno

919
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,720
model to What's called the bertron model

920
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,119
all these French French guys got to name

921
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:13,359
the I got to name the oligopoly

922
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:16,359
models the brron model is radically

923
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:19,560
different than the Coro model because

924
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:23,319
the Tron Patron model has a simple

925
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,640
conclusion which is with price

926
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:28,599
competition all you need is two firms an

927
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,520
N of two to get to the perfectly

928
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:34,520
competitive

929
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,920
outcome why why with price if United

930
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,960
America were truly price

931
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:44,560
competition why would you only need two

932
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,560
firms like that to get to perfect

933
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,319
competition why is that true if they're

934
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,319
competing on price not

935
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
quantity

936
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,560
yeah it it it's the same as our entry

937
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,839
logic remember entry logic as long as

938
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,839
our profits new firms will enter well

939
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,560
it's the same logic as long as our

940
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,440
profits the other guy will undercut so

941
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,240
if American starts making profits United

942
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,960
will come in a dollar less they'll still

943
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,640
make money they'll steal the market so

944
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,000
America come a dollar less that'll

945
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,839
continue until price equals marginal

946
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,720
cost now in fact it won't right

947
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,520
nothing's ever that perfect but

948
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,079
theoretically as long as price is

949
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,359
Epsilon above marginal cost some the

950
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,319
other firm will come and set price to

951
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,319
half an Epsilon above marginal cost and

952
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:27,000
take the

953
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,040
market okay so basically the betron

954
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,560
model

955
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,560
is totally radically different it's just

956
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,160
look two firms is perfect competition

957
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,560
there's Bas there Monopoly and perfect

958
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,319
competition no

959
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,160
oligopoly one firm's Monopoly two firms

960
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:41,359
plus is perfect

961
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,720
competition that a very radically

962
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,440
different prediction and quite frankly a

963
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,440
lot less interesting so this raises sort

964
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,920
of two points the first point is well

965
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,079
what's the right model to

966
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,200
use and the answer roughly speaking is

967
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,079
it depends on the kind of Market you're

968
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,720
thinking

969
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:01,640
about basically the answer depends

970
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,599
basically price competition is more

971
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,920
likely when you can instantaneously meet

972
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:09,079
demand quantity competition is more

973
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,920
likely when there's lags of meeting

974
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,240
demand let's think about breakfast

975
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,640
cereals versus

976
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,440
cars breakfast cereals compete on price

977
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,400
okay because the truth is if I'm lower

978
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,960
price all of a sudden people want twice

979
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,000
as many apple cinnamon cereals I boom I

980
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,880
make them they're on the shelves the

981
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,760
next

982
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,280
day cars if suddenly we want twice as

983
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,359
many cars it takes months to produce

984
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,599
them

985
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,800
so they can't just say under cutting

986
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,280
price and meet demand if you're undercut

987
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,760
price you can't meet demand so they more

988
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,800
likely to compat on

989
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,319
quantity now in reality of course as

990
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,640
always it's a mix of the two but roughly

991
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:42,480
speaking the way to think about it is

992
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,640
price competition is more likely in very

993
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,040
very rapid turnaround Industries

994
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,240
quantity competition is more likely in

995
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,000
more in Industries with more complicated

996
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,599
production processes where they're

997
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
lags and obviously nothing's at that

998
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,839
extreme but that sort of is the

999
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,599
intuition but it's not it's not a very

1000
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,440
clean distinction so you really need to

1001
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,079
know both models it's just the K model

1002
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,680
is kind of more fun butron model is kind

1003
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,520
of

1004
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,640
boring okay so that's the first point I

1005
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,000
want to make the second point I want to

1006
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,119
make which is really

1007
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,079
interesting is let's say you are

1008
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,560
breakfast

1009
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,720
cereals you're in the perfect Patron

1010
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,640
competition case perfectly competitive

1011
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,319
it's easy to create backf for

1012
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,280
cereals what do you how do you still end

1013
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:28,119
up making profits what do you do if

1014
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,960
you're a breakfast cereal company

1015
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,880
in this brron equilibrium to try to make

1016
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,800
profits what can you

1017
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:38,359
do

1018
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,359
yeah exactly you can product

1019
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,000
differentiate essentially you can create

1020
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,640
little monopolies you could say sure

1021
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,839
there's perfect competition for Cheerios

1022
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,160
but now evented apple cinnamon

1023
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,720
Cheerios and for a while at least I have

1024
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,520
a monopoly in apple cinnamon Cheerios so

1025
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,640
now I can go back to making

1026
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,200
money okay so I'm not using cereals at

1027
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,720
random it's a great example so around

1028
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,880
World War II there was essentially three

1029
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,040
types of cereal in World War II Cheerios

1030
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,880
cornflakes and Quaker roats that was

1031
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:18,680
it okay uh but by

1032
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,680
1970 there was more than 150 breakfast

1033
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,200
cereals to choose from uh including ones

1034
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,800
that are very similar like apple

1035
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,319
cinnamon

1036
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Cheerios okay by 1970s So ba but

1037
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,480
basically I'm sorry let back up I said

1038
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,040
this wrong 1953 type Cal by 1970 there

1039
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,319
150 Cal but it wasn't differentiation it

1040
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:42,200
was that stores had realized they can

1041
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,599
make generic versions so they made odios

1042
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,119
which were Cheerios different name but

1043
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,400
they were Cheerios and then they could

1044
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,800
just sell them they could sell them at

1045
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,880
Epsilon above marginal cost and make

1046
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,520
money so essentially the serial

1047
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,880
companies were not making profits

1048
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,240
anymore because generic products have

1049
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,480
been introduced to essentially mimic

1050
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,400
what they were making so they

1051
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,119
differentiated in 1989 General M apple

1052
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,640
cinnamon Cheerios it's less old than you

1053
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:06,359
think okay it's before you guys but well

1054
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,160
after me apple cinnamon

1055
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,560
Cheerios now when apple cinnamon

1056
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,720
Cheerios came in they were delicious

1057
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,040
objectively okay and there was no good

1058
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,400
substitute so they suddenly face fairly

1059
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:23,200
inelastic demand so they could raise

1060
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,599
prices above marginal cost so General

1061
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,480
Mills while getting competed to death on

1062
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,000
regular Cheerios could suddenly have a

1063
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,240
highly profitable apple cinnamon Cheerio

1064
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,040
line and they patented the apple

1065
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,119
cinnamon formula so for a while there

1066
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,440
wasn't competition now there's generic

1067
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,920
Apple cin materials but there weren't

1068
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,119
for the first few

1069
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,599
years okay so by product

1070
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,839
differentiating they ended this death

1071
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,119
cycle of Patron

1072
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,839
competition is that good or

1073
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:56,280
bad let's come back to welfare yeah oh

1074
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:01,119
and just checking your nails question

1075
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,119
answer rather uh is that good or bad

1076
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,880
yeah well is it good or bad depends very

1077
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,520
much on your model we think it's

1078
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,599
probably good because of the principle

1079
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,440
I've talked about reveal preference

1080
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,640
which is if people didn't want apple

1081
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,480
cinnamon materials they wouldn't buy

1082
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,880
them so you've created a new in product

1083
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,640
differenti you've created a new

1084
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,280
product that consumers want indeed my

1085
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,680
colleague very famous economist and

1086
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,520
Jerry hman actually estimated that the

1087
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,160
introduction of apple cinnamon Cheerios

1088
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,880
raise consumer surplus by more than $75

1089
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,960
million a

1090
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,440
year because they had this new thing

1091
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,319
they

1092
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,599
wanted now on the other

1093
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:47,240
hand they were paying a Monopoly price

1094
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,520
for it so we are better off in a world

1095
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,359
with apple cinnamon Cheerios than

1096
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,319
without it but we're still not as good

1097
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,640
off not not as well off if they weren't

1098
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,800
if there wasn't more competition bring

1099
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:00,599
apple cinnamon Cheerios so it doesn't

1100
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,760
mean in other words in Economist we talk

1101
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:03,319
about the we talked about the First

1102
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,640
Fundamental welfare theorem the best we

1103
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:07,839
can do we also talk about the second

1104
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,440
best which is well the best we can do

1105
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,920
given constraints we live

1106
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,280
under so having apple cinnamon chur is

1107
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,359
the best we could do it's the second

1108
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,839
best we are better off having Apple C

1109
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,599
than not but the first best would be

1110
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:21,160
apple cinnam materials with a regulated

1111
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,000
price at the perfectly competitive price

1112
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,160
or at least above it enough to invent

1113
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,440
new products so indeed today only five

1114
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:34,960
five firms make most cereals five firms

1115
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,000
there are 5,000 types of cereal

1116
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,559
5,000 so that

1117
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,760
raises another interesting issue so

1118
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,400
overall economistic product

1119
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,599
differentiation is good we think

1120
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,640
essentially it's driving variety people

1121
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,200
like variety if they didn't they

1122
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,240
wouldn't buy it that's

1123
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,960
good but there's starting to be an

1124
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,280
interesting question in industrial

1125
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,240
organization of the problem of choice

1126
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,160
overload which is in some sense are we

1127
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,880
actually do we have too many choices in

1128
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,240
economics we assume more choices good

1129
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,599
that's our fundamental assumption but

1130
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,839
what if now you just get to the you get

1131
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,800
to the supermarket you look that you're

1132
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:12,119
like it I'm gonna have toast okay

1133
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,839
because you're like I just can't decide

1134
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,200
there's so much well you could get to

1135
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,720
the point we're actually worse off from

1136
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
that much product differentiation that

1137
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,640
wouldn't be in a standard model that's

1138
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,079
looking forward to something we'll cover

1139
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,520
at the next to last lecture we call

1140
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:24,520
behavioral economics

1141
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:36,079
which I'm so excited about I dropped my

1142
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,400
mic uh uh I guess that's a mic drop um

1143
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,640
so uh that's in behavioral economics we

1144
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,280
talk about we'll talk about this but the

1145
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,920
point is the standard economic model

1146
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,520
would say at this person correctly

1147
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,680
answered more product differentiation is

1148
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:51,119
good but there's two caveat to that one

1149
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,960
is it's still not as good as if we had

1150
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,920
it at competitive prices just like

1151
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,839
patents are good but still not as good

1152
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,760
competitive prices and the second issue

1153
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,000
is there's a question whether proct can

1154
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,960
actually go too far and can you get

1155
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,359
Choice overload and that leads us to

1156
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,359
more interesting psychological models of

1157
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:07,720
behavior that we'll come to we talk

1158
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,680
about behavioral economics okay

1159
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,680
questions about

1160
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:16,720
that okay let's stop there and we will

1161
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,720
come back uh next week
