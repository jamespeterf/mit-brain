1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,440
um I want to wrap up a tiny bit of um

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,480
problem set seven but before we do I'm

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,000
going want us to jump ahead to the

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,119
second part where I say algorithmic

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,320
composition for a Markoff data set if

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,119
you could get your um uh what do you

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,160
call it your Jupiter notebooks going and

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,840
now uh we're getting to the point in the

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,960
semester where I'm just going to say you

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,239
can import everything from music 21 but

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,840
I will give you a few restrictions from

12
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:41,640
time to time so I don't really care what

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,200
that you're doing and um in the past

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,000
I've tried to have everyone download a

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,199
pre-prepared um set and it's always had

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,879
problems so we're just going to uh do

17
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,079
something that takes about three or four

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,559
minutes of your processor time um and

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,879
get that started now so this will

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,000
probably take a second or two you're

21
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:04,960
learning a new T term ter Corpus search

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,520
jig I can't remember if it's um if it's

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,119
important if this is capital or not but

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,479
uh that's I put on and this will go

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
through the music so music 21 comes with

26
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,240
about I can't remember what the number

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,000
is something 14,000 pieces um when you

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,439
do it just so you can do it and this

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,840
will get everything that calls itself

30
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,079
jig I don't know if there's any word

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,520
that begins with jig that um that is not

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,360
a jig but you know uh this might be

33
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,840
garbage in garbage out I'm getting 327

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,240
depending on what version you're on you

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,720
might be slightly higher slightly lower

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,520
won't influence that too much great so

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,520
um give me a quick actually the the

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,040
easiest thing I can tell is yeah up or a

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,880
snap of a finger when you when you've

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,399
got it and then I can kind of hear okay

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
okay good all of our computers are

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,079
slightly different speeds but I think

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,039
you can also start typing the next uh

44
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,079
Expressions while you're doing it so

45
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,960
jigs is something called a metadata

46
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,600
bundle that means it's a collection of

47
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,439
everything whose metadata whose titles

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,280
author something match a particular

49
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,840
search term uh you can look through you

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,920
can find things by Key by um by starting

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,599
uh meter and things like that but often

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,120
searching by title or composer it's one

53
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,280
of the first things and um what you can

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,080
do is if we look at this so as a very

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,319
short introduction to this uh jigs is a

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,480
whole 327 things we can look at the

57
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,920
first one with jigs zero and we can get

58
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:39,200
that it comes from some particular piece

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:43,480
song 47 in uh collection of Irish Tunes

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,560
called ards airs book one um so it's not

61
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,239
a piece in order to get that we can say

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,120
uh I'm going to go J1 I'm going to

63
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:57,599
equals jigs one because jigs zero had uh

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,400
some funny things on it and J jigs one.

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,879
parse calling it as a method and that

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,120
will actually load it cuz otherwise

67
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:11,120
loading 327 pieces would take a little

68
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,120
too long and then I can do show

69
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,080
hopefully a Spanish jig everyone get a

70
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,080
Spanish jig on

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,200
theirs okay good so what we're going to

72
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,400
do is we're GNA just get every jig that

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,760
is in G major so I I'm going to call it

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,280
because I I have my um uh verbose

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,640
variable names I'm GNA call it jigs in G

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,560
with underscores you might just call it

77
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
JG whatever you want um and I'll just

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,720
say

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,640
for we'll say J

80
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:49,760
meta in jigs so I remember this is thing

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
I'll say J sorry I'll go slower I'll

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,799
make this bigger right slower and bigger

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,799
always

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,760
important I have a whole big screen if

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,040
I'm not using it

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,360
okay that a little B better so I'll I'll

87
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,360
parse each one the

88
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,360
metadata so we'll say J is that one

89
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,040
parsed and now uh I'll do just kidding

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,680
JK for jigs key equals

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,680
J analyze the

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,400
key and here just for now so we can all

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,400
get caught up I'm going to print them

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
all

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,720
okay just letting

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,479
everybody okay and then I'm going to be

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,240
grabbing in a second every piece that is

98
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:49,639
in um that is in G

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,280
major why because looks like there's a

100
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,000
lot of jigs in G major so seems like a

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,000
good thing to grab

102
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,520
do we

103
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,320
feel let's we'll just keep snapping when

104
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,080
when you're when you're caught

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,880
up okay okay good good we we'll

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,320
eventually synchronize on a rhythm uh

107
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:19,000
for the things okay good now I'll say is

108
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,199
uh tonic name I'll just be verbose again

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,240
I keep jumping back and forth is that

110
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:31,639
keys do tonic which returns a pitch

111
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,639
object and a pitch object has

112
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,120
aame and what we'll do is we'll get all

113
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,440
the ones in G major or in G minor but no

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,919
actually maybe we should maybe we should

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,840
do uh no we'll just do all them if tonic

116
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:52,400
name equals g I don't think there's a

117
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:55,400
lot in G minor um jigs in g.

118
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
append

119
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,360
J and and that's where we're going to

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,160
put this aside for a bit but um you can

121
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,880
do the snap when you're done because

122
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,800
this will take a little long a while to

123
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,120
do and then I'll move on to the next

124
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,960
thing but so don't don't snap when it's

125
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,400
done snap when you're done uh done

126
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,240
programming this so that we have it for

127
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,240
later good

128
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,599
good okay now by the way mine's running

129
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,560
a lot faster than yours not because

130
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,199
mit's bought me a fancy computer but

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,720
because when you parse something once in

132
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,880
music 21 it stores it as a cash

133
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,800
somewhere um on your hard drive and so

134
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,360
it goes faster the second time so um if

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
it if you're feeling like ah I need to

136
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,639
upgrade my computer because it mine was

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,280
so much slower than his no it's just um

138
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,479
I may have you know like like they do on

139
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,840
the cooking shows I may have already

140
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,160
baked this once this morning just to

141
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,080
make sure it works okay good put that

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,400
aside for a little bit um I want to open

143
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,240
up um actually well I don't need to put

144
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,639
that aside too much um your problem Set

145
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,599
uh seven where' that go here it

146
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,919
is

147
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:13,080
um sorry about that

148
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,080
y'all a little bit more organized

149
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,560
great problem set seven ah here we go

150
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,599
seven and eight so I want to just talk

151
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,400
through um some of the things that

152
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,199
you've just been working on a couple

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,840
people um have requested and been

154
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,240
granted extra time for the last couple

155
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,599
questions so I'm not going to go through

156
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,400
them and uh besides we all have

157
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,960
different answers on the open-ended ones

158
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,680
right um actually actually yeah we no

159
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,520
we'll do this um so the major scales one

160
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,199
how hard do we find this particular one

161
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,960
easy hard little bit what was the um

162
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,680
what do you think a test case that I'm

163
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,159
going to run that uh on that um that

164
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,120
you're you can already tell me if yeah

165
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:01,560
you're going to do something

166
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,360
pathological like flat flat uh E flat

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,840
flat what's that well major yeah I'm

168
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,240
going to probably start with e sharp

169
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,560
major um or or even um yeah so certain

170
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,759
things like that to make sure or even a

171
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,000
normal thing like FSH major what am I

172
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,960
going to be looking for what's the

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,960
leading tone in FSH

174
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,199
major e sharp F natural Eble sharp uh

175
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,159
who goes for e

176
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,599
sharp F natural

177
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,839
Eble sharp yeah I'm going to be looking

178
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,360
for e sharp because a major scale um one

179
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:41,760
of the things about it is it uses every

180
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:46,399
one of the lines and

181
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,519
spaces once and only once regard using

182
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,959
some sort of sharp or

183
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,560
flat great

184
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,440
um now uh let's talk a little bit about

185
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,480
the second question any any questions

186
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,560
that you had on the roots this is um

187
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,000
depending on how much you chose to do

188
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,720
this by hand which um when we didn't

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,279
combine the two problem sets I'd like to

190
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,000
use this one as something do by hand

191
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,160
um you know it gets quite a bit harder

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,279
what's what's some of the techniques

193
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,160
that anybody remembers using on this

194
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,519
yeah convert everything to between zero

195
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,279
and 11 so ah convert everything to zero

196
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:28,240
and

197
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,000
11 for yeah no for now great and then so

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,279
so we have sort of a the pitch class

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,279
space um maybe I should so I have a

200
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,160
side yeah there we

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:45,360
go oops uh so you know zero one is this

202
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,800
what you're thinking of y two great uh

203
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,800
so that can be one part of it and then

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,839
what do you what do we do how are we

205
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,680
going to use this somebody else yeah go

206
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,600
ahead idea but also added a Cass set so

207
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,760
like there repeated notes so if there's

208
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
repeated notes yeah so we're going to

209
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,240
use the set operation

210
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,680
good to remove things that are in there

211
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,040
multiple times um what's the the yeah so

212
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,120
for root for the root of the chord

213
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,440
doesn't matter what's what octave

214
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
something's

215
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,760
in no so root is a kind of equivalence

216
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,399
class that implies octave equivalence

217
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,640
right great um so we're going to be

218
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:29,920
using a set we're going to be discarding

219
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:33,399
octaves no octaves um great what are

220
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,399
other things that you did in

221
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,360
this just want to spr it around yes oh

222
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,800
similar but I use the dionic note

223
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,680
numbers instead so use dionic note

224
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,680
numbers

225
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,399
instead note numbers so that you have

226
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,040
something like and uh I can't believe

227
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,560
there's a part a brain cell in my head

228
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,000
that uh remembers this so you had

229
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,440
something like 31 32 33

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,959
34 um great the number C4 as 29 is

231
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,399
pretty arbitrary I just like there's a

232
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,279
if you go to the media lab they have a

233
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,920
Booz and door for Imperial Grand one

234
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,279
that has the extra keys down here and

235
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,040
the lowest note on that one I assigned

236
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:22,880
to one and um just went up from there so

237
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,040
C4 ends up being 29 good and so we can

238
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,480
use that for certain parts who used

239
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,680
dionic note numbers or something like

240
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,519
that in their example in your answer to

241
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,680
two yep three four who used something

242
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,000
like pitch

243
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:44,320
classes answer good who used both

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,279
anybody my implementation ends up using

245
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,680
uh both of them so I'm going to say both

246
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:52,040
of these can be a right way to

247
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,920
work good um now what are some other

248
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,440
techniques that we did on

249
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,240
rotness yeah check for fths check for

250
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,240
fifths good

251
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,320
check

252
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
for

253
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,399
fifths what's the best which one of

254
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,839
these do you think works better for

255
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,839
checking for

256
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,839
fifths you want to take a

257
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,519
guess I we don't want to say either them

258
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,800
just cuz they're both like number based

259
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,880
so you could like have S like augmented

260
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,680
thing so like return the same difference

261
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,839
yeah so it has a lot to do with whether

262
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,320
we we care about spelling equivalents or

263
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,680
not right so we can always have um you

264
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,920
know a doubly augmented fourth sounds

265
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,920
the same as a perfect fifth but it

266
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,519
repulses me because it is a dissonance

267
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,279
right actually I'm not repulsed by

268
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,600
dissonance but uh it is and what do we

269
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,320
have the problem if we're only looking

270
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,760
at dionic note numbers give me a fifth

271
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,199
that's um that might actually supposed

272
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,920
to well change does it change the root

273
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,920
which fifth you

274
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:11,680
find no not really good so we check for

275
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,320
fifths anybody check for any other

276
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,199
intervals yeah I did the dumb thing in

277
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,480
here for 2/3 check for two 2/3 in a row

278
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:24,959
2/3 so if you have

279
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,240
one3 and you have

280
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,720
2/3 then you might have something yeah

281
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
you're right that was a very very dumb

282
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,760
thing to say that it was a dumb thing

283
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,920
because I think it's a great way of

284
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:42,000
doing it so we have if you can have 2/3

285
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,800
then presumably the bottom one is a root

286
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,360
uh where's the problem

287
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,360
come yeah a major child

288
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,600
minor okay great so minor third versus

289
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,880
major

290
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,720
third I want you to think in your head

291
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,880
and then tell your neighbor yes or no on

292
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,639
the counter three on whether does the

293
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,040
does a major third or minor third does

294
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,040
this affect the

295
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:21,399
rout one two 3 no no okay so we might so

296
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,920
we're not going to do that for right now

297
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,639
but I'm going to put this in the save

298
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,480
for later pile because uh Roots only one

299
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,440
of the things we're going to want to do

300
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,519
uh safe for later but no so not going to

301
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,120
do uh what's an issue that you might

302
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,360
still have but but that's going to be

303
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,360
important with

304
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,880
this so you've gotten rid of

305
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,959
octaves so let's say we're going to

306
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,759
write everything in the same octave

307
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:53,680
number for second can I blank this for a

308
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,240
second and um

309
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,040
yep

310
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,040
okay is that supposed to yep okay

311
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,759
okay you still have it over there if you

312
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,759
need it

313
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,519
um so if we're not if we're saying

314
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,320
everything is in octave 4 and I'm going

315
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,800
to rewrite that

316
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,279
f a c the F major Triad

317
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,600
f

318
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,639
a c right is that going to

319
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,920
work third

320
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:39,079
third yeah um I mean like yeah if we use

321
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:42,440
the um like pitch uh class then this

322
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:44,639
upper c will be um yeah zero which so

323
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,800
you won't be able to find it just so it

324
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,560
will be yeah where will it be if we

325
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,519
let's say we put everything Optive four

326
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,839
it'll look like it's below it it'll

327
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,839
below

328
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,920
it so what is this now

329
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,800
still a major still a major TR what what

330
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,160
would we call this by the

331
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,600
way first inversion second inversion

332
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,279
second inversion

333
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,079
64 numbering instead of I've I've just

334
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,920
switched between two different systems

335
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:22,399
that are kind of equivalences of each

336
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:26,120
other I switched from the calling this 3

337
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:30,800
three system which we use sometimes to

338
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,720
the calling this 53 system which we use

339
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,399
more often where one system where you

340
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,120
measure everything from the note below

341
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,639
and one thing where you measure

342
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,079
everything from the

343
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:46,279
base boy isn't this like terrible in

344
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:49,160
music that we do this um do you remember

345
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,279
the first time that uh that somebody

346
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,160
said to you something like you know oh I

347
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:58,440
was in meth major and I was on scale

348
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,959
degree 2 on a 57 chord and you actually

349
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,560
meent heard in your head I was on scale

350
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,160
degree 2 in a Roman numeral 5

351
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,720
superscript 7 thing uh somebody figure

352
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,160
out what part of our brain is doing this

353
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,400
kind of translation on the Fly that the

354
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,600
exact same numbers are being translated

355
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,799
in different ways our memory so this is

356
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,079
not one that we talk about very much

357
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,480
this particular translation but but we

358
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,559
do it quite a bit and I just did it

359
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,480
maybe too fast so yeah 64 or the other

360
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:35,000
way you can do it is say it's a third

361
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,600
stacked on top of a fourth right 3 + 4

362
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,880
in music

363
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:44,480
equals six yep yeah um okay so this is

364
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,799
also something we have to worry about

365
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,360
that was a parenthesis within a

366
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,360
parenthesis how do we get around this

367
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,360
problem yeah um I basically added 12 to

368
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,640
the lowest I sorted then added 12 to the

369
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,679
lowest not twice and check

370
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,440
so okay so you you sort and then if this

371
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,039
doesn't match 3 three then what do you

372
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,960
do you um I I bump the lowest note up an

373
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,960
octave you bump the lowest note up the

374
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,760
octave

375
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,120
great will that always be enough no so

376
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,039
what you have to decid do next so let's

377
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,880
let's sometimes you'll will have uh yeah

378
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,320
Adam go ahead I took the initial cord

379
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,159
and I duplicated it the whole cord above

380
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,360
so I guarantee that I will see a pattern

381
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,080
that will be either major

382
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,480
Min okay so you take whatever notes you

383
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
see now I'm going to put it in first

384
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,880
inversion except there are chords

385
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,320
besides C major Michael um so we'll put

386
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,919
it in first

387
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,120
inversion

388
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:58,640
ACF call that 63 chord and if you just

389
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,640
keep duplicating things up

390
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:07,159
is that right yep you will eventually at

391
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:09,520
some point have this three ah five3

392
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:13,280
stack right the stack of thirds there

393
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,280
will be a 53 embedded in

394
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,919
there yeah do that great hair or just

395
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,600
fixing go super um these are all

396
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,960
techniques that work really well here

397
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,400
what are the techniques that will work

398
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,320
if you have sevenths

399
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,640
or if you might might be given something

400
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,640
that is not a Triad at

401
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,280
all how would you do this with sevenths

402
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,720
begin with did anybody do that as their

403
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,039
extension you did yeah the way I did it

404
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,720
is I worked off of like what I guess

405
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:52,799
like first I had a function that kind of

406
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,280
like reduced the um the input to see

407
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,200
whether or not it could like kind of

408
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,840
work as a tri or as a cord okay so first

409
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,640
you I'm just repeating for the bicr

410
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,960
first you had a function that reduced as

411
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,799
a Triad or seventh to see if it worked

412
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,919
with the previous thing uhuh then and

413
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,240
then I kind of there's a like I guess I

414
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,480
combine both functions and so first I

415
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,559
iterate through a list of

416
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,120
potential um like interval distances and

417
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,840
then just for

418
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,760
each um potential candidate I had like a

419
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
rout and then iterate through each

420
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
potential candidate and see check

421
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,440
whether or not like the interval

422
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,880
distances were the same after adjusting

423
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,840
it was like bigger so you you checked

424
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,280
each one for each candidate as if the

425
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,960
root and then you checked to see if the

426
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,159
interval distances matched something

427
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,720
great super it was a second hand for

428
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,120
doing it how yeah really similar yeah so

429
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,640
increasingly similar great super this by

430
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,360
the way it's not one of the great

431
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,120
unsolved problems in algorithms but I do

432
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,280
not know if it has been proven what the

433
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,320
most uh algorithmically efficient way of

434
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:03,080
finding a root in um in anything

435
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:07,200
especially when we have uh chords like

436
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,200
here's one of our favorite in C

437
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,000
major what we want to call that

438
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,559
chord no close

439
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,080
but dominant seventh

440
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,600
chord should be four pitches which one's

441
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,679
missing d d which is the what of the

442
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,320
chord

443
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,600
fifth of the chord yeah the fifth of the

444
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,559
chord missing most common note in the

445
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,120
chord to leave out unless you're chopan

446
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,080
and then he likes to leave out that one

447
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,000
leave out the third

448
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,559
uh usually you can't leave out the base

449
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,440
otherwise you don't have a five although

450
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,600
uh there's a music theorist Hugo reman

451
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,799
who would disagree with you on that and

452
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,440
of course you can't leave out the

453
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,240
seventh otherwise you don't have that

454
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,679
but yeah so how to deal with this and

455
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,240
how to uh do these things is still

456
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,000
something that uh we're working on and I

457
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,000
was giving a presentation a few uh

458
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,520
months ago on how things were calculated

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,120
and in the middle of the presentation I

460
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,679
go oh my gosh that's not algorithmically

461
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,279
efficient and so somewhere in the music

462
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,200
21 thing I quickly stetched to do

463
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,840
remember how to make this faster and

464
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,799
I've forgotten how to make it faster so

465
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,840
so maybe we'll go back into that great

466
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:31,159
um then the last topic sorry let's put

467
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,159
that back back

468
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,679
and so Roman

469
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,240
numerals what are some of the

470
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,760
differences between the Roman numerals

471
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:54,880
and um and uh just finding the root yeah

472
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,120
go ahead I took theic that we given and

473
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,400
made a scale it and once I had the scale

474
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:04,200
I um found the of the cord and then saw

475
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,799
what position it was in in the scale

476
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,520
great so you created a Scale based on

477
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,760
the what was given the tonic the tonic

478
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,159
yeah I I only gave the tonic I didn't

479
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,279
give the key right because we're still

480
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,159
we're that created a major scale based

481
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,640
on the tonic and you saw which position

482
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,039
it was in that's that's really a great

483
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,880
great way of doing it what if it uh it I

484
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,279
didn't give it in this but what if I it

485
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,279
wasn't in the scale how would you do

486
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,279
that

487
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,080
anyone know of things like flat three or

488
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,520
flat 7even yeah just match the step just

489
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,440
match the step and then figure out the

490
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,799
subtraction of the difference so great

491
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,480
so we can find a position in the scale

492
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,200
if if you were wondering why um question

493
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,720
one was on major

494
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,840
scales that's exactly one of the

495
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,320
approaches I thought you could do

496
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,200
anybody else um have a different

497
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,760
methodology for this yeah if it wasn't

498
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,880
in the scale I just return never say

499
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:08,279
this invalid yep and it's invalid in

500
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:12,880
this assignment right was it not yep um

501
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:16,080
good um any other things to take all

502
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,679
your information now was Jake right who

503
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,600
who brought in major third minor 3r yeah

504
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,320
yep now I think it's time to get that in

505
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,799
what do you how do you convert

506
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,760
that what what does this information

507
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,760
tell us about the Roman numeral

508
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,559
yeah upper lower case uppercase lower

509
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,440
case good or there's one other thing

510
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:40,320
to put on what's the what's the Roman

511
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,240
numeral that often takes a special

512
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,399
symbol diminish seven yeah so the

513
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,799
seventh scale degree quite often the

514
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:51,760
five with the with the o seven with an O

515
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:56,600
after it the diminished seven

516
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:59,480
good um yeah and then inversions those

517
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,799
become kind of the problem

518
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,880
there so I want to give um like a twom

519
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,279
minute Peak on um the code that you've

520
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,360
now unlocked uh sorry there is a way to

521
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,399
make this

522
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,399
bigger nope there we

523
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:16,399
go

524
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,960
um and just to give a little bit of peek

525
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,039
at uh music

526
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,960
21s where we

527
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,000
go sorry tiny bit too big tell me yeah

528
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,840
okay that should be right

529
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,480
size sorry a lot of docks over time uh

530
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,399
things Roman numeral for from chord so

531
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,840
this is um something so given a chord

532
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:49,200
object and a key object um and then

533
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,960
possibly a preference for do we prefer

534
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,799
secondary dominance can you have in

535
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:58,480
major can you have a major chord on two

536
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:03,320
or is that the dominant of the dominant

537
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:06,559
of five um and try to give an

538
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,159
appropriate um name so why I don't know

539
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,120
why my first one was is so complicated I

540
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:12,919
guess the back then I was just like hey

541
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,799
I can do this uh let's see if we can

542
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:20,520
come up sign so if you have a chord E C

543
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:23,880
G B flat and then a few extra octave

544
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,520
things just to uh throw throw off in F

545
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,919
major that should be a five six5 who

546
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:35,600
remembers their uh inversions of seventh

547
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:40,039
chords so root position five seven then

548
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:43,039
first inversion five 65 second

549
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:46,159
inversion 543 and third

550
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:50,080
inversion 542 some people also teach the

551
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,880
tradition two and some people uh so 42

552
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,120
is the most commonly used one I've seen

553
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,039
some people have the less the even more

554
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,960
Compact 2 and some people the more

555
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:02,559
verbose 642 um

556
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,640
any Baseball fans I always think of um

557
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,440
double plays as oh I mean second

558
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,159
inversion that was a because they always

559
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,240
never mind um okay so you can have

560
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,120
certain certain things and then the one

561
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,840
of the big issues is that people call um

562
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,960
Roman Nu Roman numeral six and seven in

563
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,960
minor according to different naming

564
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,559
Traditions so some people say that um

565
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,960
that the the harmonic minor scale always

566
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:35,399
dictates what the um letter name is and

567
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,399
some people say that um that the uh that

568
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,279
if you say it's diminished like

569
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:41,240
diminished seven you already know it's

570
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,720
been raised and you say it's major you

571
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,799
know it's been lowered and you don't

572
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,679
need a sharp or a flat in front of it so

573
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,240
there's a whole bunch of different uh

574
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,720
conventions and unfortunately that's

575
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,399
something we haven't standardized uh for

576
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,480
anyone who's had two different music

577
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,519
theory teachers you might have already

578
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,200
encountered that okay so let's get down

579
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,960
to the code

580
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,519
um to show some of the things that I

581
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,360
found and maybe you'll come up with

582
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,320
better one uh who has taken a 302 or a

583
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,720
class that has encountered augmented

584
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,120
sixth chords yeah so you know these

585
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,720
these country codes Italian French Swiss

586
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,600
some people call it some people English

587
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,279
German don't need to worry about that

588
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:23,799
for this class um since we didn't have

589
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,480
it but um one of the other things that

590
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:28,640
uh comes up a lot is that you need to be

591
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,320
able to change

592
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:36,039
certain um certain things that might

593
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,039
come up so that's a 57 chord is

594
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,919
753 or 7531 if you want to call it and

595
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:47,240
but we only call it seven uh 65 seventh

596
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,240
chord first inversion is um is 653 but

597
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,640
we call it 65 so you just need a bunch

598
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,840
of of substitution things and some and

599
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,120
these aren't all of them because we grab

600
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,320
them from a lot of places to do make

601
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,960
sure ninth works that's all is a nice um

602
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,320
thing to do so we find is the first

603
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,880
thing you want to know is uh what's the

604
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,320
root of the chord and finding the root

605
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,519
as I said is already an interesting

606
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,600
algorithm and then figure out how many

607
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:18,640
semmit tones is there between that root

608
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,200
and whatever is the third and find out

609
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,320
if it's on the basis of major or minor

610
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,080
because that's going to determine

611
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,640
uppercase or lowercase right uh we'll

612
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,919
skip anything uh that says if there

613
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:35,559
isn't key um put that in then created

614
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,480
this conceptual device called a figure

615
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:42,519
tupple which um is the notion of

616
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,320
something like if you had a

617
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,679
chord with I don't

618
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,039
know you might sorry that is not a

619
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:55,919
French vocal cff

620
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:55,919
um you know you might

621
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,640
have call that

622
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,720
flat five flat

623
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,519
3 in some

624
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:11,039
ways that this one of these figures call

625
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:15,279
this a figure tupple which tells

626
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,880
you trip Hazard uh how what's the thing

627
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,200
over the base um It's just sometimes

628
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,799
easier to keep track of how many

629
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,440
semitones is it altered and what do we

630
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,559
call it so you might think that negative

631
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,840
one always means flat but there's some

632
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,159
cases where that's implied by other

633
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:38,080
parts of the

634
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:41,640
thing then correct the flat six to six

635
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,640
in minor depending on people's

636
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,760
spelling then we end up trying to figure

637
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,360
out all these things on how we can

638
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:53,919
figure how we can transpose the tonic so

639
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,960
that we can um deal with those things

640
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,559
that are outside the scale so like what

641
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,600
we said um if you have a root that is

642
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,159
not part of the scale then we just

643
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,600
really quickly construct a whole other

644
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,159
scale down a semitone or up a semitone

645
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,159
and so we can do all the other

646
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,799
calculations and then just throw Flats

647
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,519
on everything

648
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,519
afterwards um probably guess what this

649
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:23,000
does capitalize if it's major cap lower

650
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,720
case it's ner um and then a lot of these

651
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,799
things are slow so a lot of if we've

652
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,480
already seen this before get it from the

653
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:34,519
cache um

654
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:37,799
and then something to turn uh you know

655
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:40,000
one to I two to I I 3 to you know

656
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:43,279
whatever convert a number from 1 to

657
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,360
3,999 to a Roman numeral um I don't know

658
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,600
why I stopped at 3

659
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,360
3,999 um and it's because I'm a

660
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,320
historian and the numbers above 3,999

661
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,039
were never standardized no matter what

662
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,760
your teachers tell you um then we try to

663
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:02,360
figure out uh

664
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,840
what kind of figure it's going to be to

665
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,440
try to get how what kind of inversion

666
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,840
it's going to be so what's the string

667
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:19,120
for that and that's where a lot of these

668
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:19,120
uh what is it 6 4 3 become 64 and so on

669
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,480
um then there's then we try to think

670
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:31,000
about okay so we take what's the prefix

671
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,320
is it flat 2 whatever add to that the

672
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,559
Roman letter is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and

673
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,120
then the inversion and then everything

674
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,279
after that is every special case that

675
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,679
we've encountered over time that uh that

676
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:51,240
turns out to um be an inconsistency in

677
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,120
the standard of Roman

678
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,080
numerals this is not a history class but

679
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,960
there's a really fascinating thing about

680
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Roman numerals analysis and that is it

681
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:06,399
is a mashing together of two different

682
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,039
incompatible um analysis types that's

683
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,919
over time got put together into one but

684
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,080
that um so that things like the

685
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,760
uppercase and lowercase duplicating the

686
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,919
function of putting a flat three on

687
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,639
something and so what happens if you're

688
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:27,120
in C major and then you see lowercase 5

689
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:27,120
flat three

690
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,799
so let's say you're in C major and you

691
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,240
see lowercase 5 flat 3 what do you think

692
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:38,440
that should

693
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:41,080
be G as the base as a root yep flat B

694
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,320
flat and D what happens if I leave off

695
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:48,279
the flat

696
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:51,039
three same same so is this a cautionary

697
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:53,159
you can add it or you can put it out um

698
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:58,679
but then there are other cases what if

699
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,679
I'm in C major and I put 17

700
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,039
versus One Flat

701
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:12,839
7 or but the same thing with 57 doesn't

702
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,040
need the

703
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:20,839
flat five flat 7 same thing so there are

704
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,639
all these inconsistencies in the world

705
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:26,040
of Roman numeral analysis and it really

706
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,720
begins to get exposed when you start

707
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,159
doing things that uh we're going to be

708
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,079
looking into right now so we're going to

709
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,679
get to the algorithmic composition in

710
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,040
just a bit but I'd like you do for a

711
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,520
second is oops which which one's

712
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,480
here we'll go back into our favorite bck

713
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,679
piece because Corpus sorry Switching

714
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:52,119
gears up laptops open again

715
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:59,119
um we did this once already bwv

716
00:34:52,119 --> 00:35:02,440
66.6 and we'll um remember cify

717
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,440
corded and we'll say cord boach today

718
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,440
cordach equals bach.

719
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:15,040
chordify and um I remember this one as

720
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:21,079
basically an F minor so we'll say uh FM

721
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,079
equals key. key FP lowercase

722
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:31,320
f and what we'll do on this is just for

723
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,520
so actually snap up when you've got

724
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,200
this yeah and also by the way if I'm

725
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,480
typoing this one I don't have a template

726
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,880
for so if I typo uh definitely correct

727
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:45,359
me on this so for chord in ch I often

728
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,079
say I don't write the word chord because

729
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,800
I don't want to lose access to my chord

730
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,680
module uh chord boach chord. chord for

731
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,319
each

732
00:35:51,680 --> 00:36:00,640
chord we'll say is RN equals Roman do

733
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:03,000
that Roman numeral

734
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,040
from

735
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,560
chord CH and we're in the key of F minor

736
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,200
said you could just write the string FM

737
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,200
there but it'll be a lot

738
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,440
slower and then we'll just say

739
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,920
CH so actually give a second on that so

740
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,480
you're going to iterate for the recursed

741
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,040
that's square brackets mean all the

742
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,800
chords in chord boach get the chord out

743
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,520
get analyze the Roman numeral from chord

744
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,240
uh if I were a really really mean uh

745
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,440
Prof I would say your next assignment is

746
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,000
to reimplement that but uh the the you

747
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,440
can see the gray hairs here that's

748
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,960
exactly from that uh from implementing

749
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,839
that one um that and quartery are the

750
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,280
two reasons uh I'm getting old and um

751
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,960
now what we're going to do is we'll say

752
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:58,960
the chords lyric we did this once right

753
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,960
chords lyric equals RN's figure

754
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,079
I think we did this but we did rather

755
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,079
fast so I want to make sure

756
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,640
that oops that's not going to do

757
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,440
anything right because

758
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,520
I because I put it onto the thing I want

759
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,520
uh cordach doow my

760
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,200
apologies and you're going to realize

761
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,920
there's one thing I didn't do that's

762
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,280
going to make it look really funny I

763
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,800
forgot to put all of the chords in

764
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,040
in closed position but at least it works

765
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,040
pretty

766
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,160
well so we I'm going to scroll to the

767
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,160
end so about

768
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,480
here if you didn't get it all don't

769
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:50,000
worry um

770
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,839
uh some some of y'all have are are to be

771
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,119
thanked in the class especially John and

772
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,680
Adam for when I forget to put uh a

773
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,319
notebook up U that remind me and now all

774
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,680
the previous notebooks up so if you miss

775
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:02,119
anything uh they'll they'll be going up

776
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,040
later but you can see that there's some

777
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:08,160
places where you see chords that look

778
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,640
like cords that you've seen in your life

779
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,839
four 5 6

780
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,280
1 And Then There Are Places yeah five

781
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:19,560
that looks pretty good sorry that auto

782
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,040
saave thing knocks it

783
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:28,160
down and then chords

784
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:32,200
763 that's um rather unusual

785
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,400
um flat six augmented in sixth FL

786
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,000
position you all you all remember how to

787
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,319
resolve that chord

788
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,079
right no no I've never heard of that

789
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:45,079
chord in my life so this is um a pretty

790
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,079
dumb way of working with things in fact

791
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm just going to go straight from uh

792
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:53,800
this to the to the last uh part here

793
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,079
then if you get to the top you see a lot

794
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:00,000
of figures that look pretty normal no

795
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,599
nothing after the three you see six

796
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,480
nothing six whatever these look a lot

797
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,839
better seven those those are numbers you

798
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,240
used to seeing the Arabic numerals used

799
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:13,240
to seeing but the Romans are way off why

800
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,880
are the these Romans so

801
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:19,480
weird because we're wearing Togos and no

802
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,480
no why are the Roman numerals so

803
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:30,440
weird remember this

804
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,640
piece goe it start in a starts in a yeah

805
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,880
if we go back into no we don't we don't

806
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,440
have to we remember uh how it goes bit

807
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,520
right it starts in a

808
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,040
major so one of the things you can real

809
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,720
start thinking about on your computer

810
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,680
system is if you see a lot of three Flat

811
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,319
6 Flat 6 three or flat 7 three three

812
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,839
flat 7 and you're dealing with a

813
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:55,480
classical piece of music what have you

814
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,240
probably gotten

815
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,920
wrong the key the key specifically

816
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,920
you've put it in blank instead of blank

817
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,760
you've put it

818
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:09,640
in what kind of relative minor instead

819
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,640
of the relative major good what if you

820
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,440
accidentally analyze the piece in major

821
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,359
instead of minor what would you be

822
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,359
seeing a lot of instead for one to

823
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,400
five um yeah you'll see six minor you'll

824
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,680
see two minor and three major six minor

825
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,920
two yeah six six twos and threes so that

826
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,760
might tell you something about hey

827
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:40,119
you're in a different um position great

828
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:46,440
so strange Roman strange Roman numerals

829
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:46,440
probably means failure of key strange

830
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,119
figures what what do these strange

831
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,119
figures probably

832
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,280
mean yeah Adam isn't a very compatible

833
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,119
cord isn't a very compatible chord or

834
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,400
it's a chord that has embedded possibly

835
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,079
what in

836
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,760
it non- chord tones good let's let's um

837
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:14,319
everybody's favorites non- chord tones

838
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,240
we'll go Hannah favorite non- chord

839
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,760
tone doesn't have to be your favorite

840
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,319
just name one I'm not going to lie I

841
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,040
don't remember what don't remember

842
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,359
anything great great so you so that's

843
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,760
great because you'll be listening up

844
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,760
because we're going to be doing some of

845
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,760
these

846
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:36,079
dimin F diminish fifth ah so diminish

847
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:40,560
fifth is a chord tone when you say it

848
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,000
that way but it's not um it's it's or uh

849
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,240
it's or non-harm non-harmonic tone is

850
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,560
probably maybe the term that you've

851
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,560
heard in other things when you say it

852
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,359
that way it might be part of a chord but

853
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,920
it might has to have function in order

854
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,119
to do it so function like John

855
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:59,040
anticipation an anticipation yeah where

856
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,720
you um where you you get to the the cord

857
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,359
maybe you get to the tonic a little bit

858
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,520
too early good anticipation is a really

859
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:06,680
good one anyone else have a favorite

860
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,359
one yep

861
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,760
suspension suspension yeah where you

862
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,319
hold the cord a little the tone too long

863
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,839
I mean it's great don't you know

864
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,240
obviously it's wonderful but too long

865
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,480
for the harmonic analysis so let's let's

866
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,480
say when computationally if if your job

867
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,440
is to get rid of non- cord tones what

868
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,119
are you going to do how do you get rid

869
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,119
of uh anticipation

870
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,720
rest of the cord following yeah you just

871
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,400
have the rest of the chord following

872
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,839
great how do you get rid of a

873
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,240
suspension I cut it shorter you cut it

874
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,000
shorter great great um so what's what's

875
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,079
another non- chord tone nobody's done

876
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,920
the one that you the first one that most

877
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,040
of us learn these are more yeah step

878
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,040
wise stepwise yeah between two things

879
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,880
what what do we call

880
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,359
that passing tone yes the passing tone

881
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,359
so great well how do you usually get rid

882
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:02,920
of a passing

883
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:05,839
tone just cut it out and make the

884
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:09,400
previous note longer right how do you

885
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,400
identify a passing

886
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:15,520
tone it just looks like it doesn't it

887
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,240
it's so easy on our neural processors of

888
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,680
our eyes it just sounds like it what

889
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,680
kinds of

890
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:28,599
things what criteria do we need to know

891
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,599
that sign's a passing time

892
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,319
those the worst stems

893
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,240
ever like the cff doesn't matter does it

894
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,160
um no it's still passing what which

895
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:01,839
one's the passing tone who votes for C

896
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,680
who votes for D who votes for E okay

897
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,599
good lots of lots of D's especially on

898
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,160
the side of the room that I've

899
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,240
privileged by making it much easier to

900
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,920
see right okay sorry about that I'm not

901
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,599
going to stay here very long so just

902
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,240
squint for a little bit and feel free to

903
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,800
shout out what um what I'm doing so free

904
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,720
close captioning great so what what

905
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,520
kinds of What kinds of things would you

906
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,839
be putting if statements on if you were

907
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,559
you all like I'll just throw it in

908
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:29,480
neural net and it'll learn but no um

909
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,400
what if you had to program it what what

910
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:37,839
would you be looking

911
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:41,680
for yeah seconds seconds so we have to

912
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,520
have a second and then a second do the

913
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,880
seconds have to

914
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:49,400
be

915
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,559
ascending no do they can they be in

916
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,720
opposite

917
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:56,640
directions no why not because then you

918
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,760
nebor then you have a neighbor tone yep

919
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:06,960
so 2 2 two second second equals passing

920
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:11,680
tone -2 -2 equals passing tone 2 -2

921
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,640
equals neighbor tone and -2 2 is

922
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,119
neighbor tone I know some of you are

923
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,400
already trying to pass your leak code

924
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,040
things and thinking okay what's the bit

925
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,599
wide operation that's going to make it

926
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,160
so I don't have to put all four of those

927
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,200
uh no it's okay there only four so you

928
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,960
can you can look find find these uh in

929
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,000
here so yeah you might be doing that

930
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,160
then anything else that you think is

931
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,359
important for saying that something is a

932
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,400
passing

933
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,280
tone let's have this

934
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,119
format yeah making sure the notes

935
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,760
surrounding it are CES making sure the

936
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,359
notes surrounding it are chord tones

937
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,480
yeah so these things have to fit into

938
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,400
into this and this is uh this is why I

939
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,520
was saying that you know uh diminish

940
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,960
fifth might be a a might not be a non-

941
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,960
chord Tone If the surrounding chord is

942
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,480
happens to be in Minish Triad and you

943
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,880
might say well then all of these might

944
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,720
be chord tones because maybe the

945
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,359
surrounding chord really is

946
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,359
4763 but probably not what do you what

947
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,200
do we so so now there there's two ways

948
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:17,079
to look at this we can do this on the

949
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,520
individual voice level and so that's

950
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,160
what we're going or individual part

951
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,680
level if you're looking at a crow that's

952
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,760
what you're going to do before

953
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,599
certifying the other thing you can do

954
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,400
what do you think is happening here you

955
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,800
can't even really see

956
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,400
um what's happening but you can kind of

957
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,800
see that we have 46 something weird

958
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,520
happening and then

959
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,720
four so we're going something's

960
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,240
happening here where we're going from

961
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,800
the first inversion of a chord to the

962
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,800
root position of the

963
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,880
cord and these there might be a lot of

964
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,160
passing Motion in there so you might be

965
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,040
able to identify these non- chord tones

966
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:01,920
at the chord level or you might be

967
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,960
working on the uh individual voice

968
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,920
level which one do you think works

969
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,119
better individual voice level chord

970
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,079
level individual

971
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,720
voice

972
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:17,119
chord yeah uh and the answer we don't

973
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,720
really know uh I try to do both because

974
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,760
some some things are easier to get from

975
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:27,520
one than the other so um great we've

976
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:30,200
gone through and um we've done

977
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,319
question uh outline one and most of

978
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,079
Outline Three on here I jumped around

979
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,960
because I realized that a different

980
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,160
ordering was going to be better um so

981
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:44,680
we're going to sort of gone through

982
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,760
three A and B and then I'll leave CD uh

983
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,440
C and D for a little bit

984
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,960
later um what I want to do since we have

985
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:56,240
our jigs loaded up I want to do a little

986
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,800
bit of two um yeah scratch well we'll

987
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,760
say take two if we're doing it no we're

988
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,720
not doing that level of editing but one

989
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,960
one last little thing problem set N9

990
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,960
you're going to be getting in a little

991
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,800
bit and what you're going to be doing in

992
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:13,000
problem set nine is this kind of chord

993
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:16,520
tone identification and removal so

994
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,119
you're going to be given various you're

995
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,200
going to be given various four-part

996
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:25,760
corals and what I want to see is instead

997
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:29,480
of um things like this that look really

998
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:34,640
hilarious something pretty clear out and

999
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:36,240
a nice sort of reduction of that um one

1000
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,440
of the things you might start thinking

1001
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,760
about is that Roman numerals are a type

1002
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,920
of equivalence class on a set of pitches

1003
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,319
that's not only about uh well it helps

1004
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,880
to say that this is the same cord the

1005
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:52,760
same cordal function in different Keys

1006
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,799
it's also an equivalence class

1007
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,720
on on a sort of the cloud of notes

1008
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:02,119
including non non- chord tones that we

1009
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,079
can that we can say these two things are

1010
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,920
the same Roman numeral even though one

1011
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,480
of them has filled in all the passing

1012
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,799
tones or neighbor tones um suspensions

1013
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,720
what do we get them all Escape tones

1014
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:17,240
this pretty hard one there there a bunch

1015
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,000
of other um ones uh but yeah so these

1016
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,760
are uh things that you're going to be

1017
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,400
doing so I'll be giving it to you in

1018
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,799
just a little bit so you want to be able

1019
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,559
to take something um and make it quite a

1020
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:30,760
bit nicer your you're going to have help

1021
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,160
on this um couple things of help it's

1022
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,079
you're going to have uh at least a week

1023
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,960
I'm thinking next Friday uh there's the

1024
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,000
danger between uh I don't want to give I

1025
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,920
don't want to give too little time but I

1026
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,599
also don't want to go so late that

1027
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,200
you're can't have your full attention on

1028
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,640
the final projects so what's your thing

1029
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,960
what I'd like you to do is you're going

1030
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,359
to be doing problem set nine with your

1031
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:59,799
partner that you're working on the uh

1032
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:02,160
final project with and one other team so

1033
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:04,480
groups of four the the team of four I

1034
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,559
think you're a natural group of four so

1035
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,599
why don't you put them there what i' but

1036
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,920
what I'd like you to do is there are

1037
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:15,040
different steps along the process here

1038
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,319
I'll just I'll pop up P at nine right

1039
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,520
now so you can see it while it's here

1040
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:20,960
even though I'm doing some last second

1041
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,000
uh tweaks depending on what we get

1042
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:28,440
through today

1043
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,440
um great so

1044
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,000
P set 9 you're going to be doing

1045
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:37,559
reduction and key analysis of tonal

1046
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,599
music and I want you to say note this

1047
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,160
you need not get every chord right it

1048
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,040
need not work on every cral I'm asking

1049
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,319
for a decent amount of work toward a

1050
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,760
solution not a complete solution in

1051
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,559
itself great okay so you're not going to

1052
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:55,880
be doing that

1053
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:57,640
um so what you probably like to do is um

1054
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,079
well what you're you're going to do is

1055
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,119
going I'm going to call vocabulary

1056
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,760
reduce on a score and you're going to

1057
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,319
give me either a score or a part

1058
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,760
depending on how you try to choose to

1059
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:15,640
represent it that is the reduced one um

1060
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,000
you have four people on your

1061
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,799
team you probably do not want to

1062
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,640
implement you definitely do not want to

1063
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:25,480
implement your entire solution inside V

1064
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,079
this vocabulary reduce programming in a

1065
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,119
Jupiter notebook

1066
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:32,240
take this divide it up and um share it

1067
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:36,200
among your favorite collaboration uh

1068
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:38,760
collaborative coding tools um I'm

1069
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,760
starting you the with a crow that's

1070
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,319
easier than the one we've been working

1071
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,760
on in class

1072
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:48,200
66.6 and here are the four I'm going to

1073
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,720
test you on for 90% of your points so

1074
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:54,160
I'm going to tell you that um oops so

1075
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,240
this is why I'm still editing you have

1076
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,240
key analysis unlocked because we lost uh

1077
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,559
sort of four classes this year so you'll

1078
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:06,079
be allowed to analyze the key using

1079
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:08,440
analysis things we're going to cify um

1080
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,559
say this ad part ID is group is

1081
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:14,359
something that lets you figure out for

1082
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:16,359
each pitch in your cified score what

1083
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:18,599
part it originally came from which can

1084
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:20,680
be very useful for figuring out what to

1085
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:25,440
delete and

1086
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,000
um yeah we'll just show the first um put

1087
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,440
it put it in actually I'll show show

1088
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,119
different steps that might happen um

1089
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,880
here so what I've done is I've gone

1090
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:37,319
through one chord that if you um load

1091
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:41,000
these things sorry one Corral

1092
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:42,480
oops okay uh sorry I forgot I have to

1093
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,920
restart and run

1094
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,200
all yep here we go so you're here's the

1095
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:52,079
original Corral that I'm asking you to

1096
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:54,119
work on and then um unlocking sign

1097
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,799
called implode which you might find

1098
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:59,400
useful just for seeing a crow onto

1099
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:03,359
stance staves it might not be too useful

1100
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:05,520
for you um analytically and then what

1101
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,400
I've done is given

1102
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:13,480
you the first part of the answer how an

1103
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:17,200
answer how I think the this might work

1104
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:22,119
with all the non- chord tones

1105
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:24,559
labeled and then second one um here is

1106
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:26,079
after um after they've been after

1107
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,920
they've been removed so you have them

1108
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:33,599
all AED now you have all them removed

1109
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,079
and then the last step you might be

1110
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,960
trying to figure out that actually

1111
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:40,599
there's some key changes in here so you

1112
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,119
move from a major to D major to a major

1113
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:45,640
and so

1114
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,400
on why have I given you these uh

1115
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,200
intermediate steps if this is what

1116
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,960
you're trying to get to it's because you

1117
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:56,520
have a larger team and so what I would

1118
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,119
like is that somebody can be working on

1119
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,040
part four while somebody else is working

1120
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,520
on part three while somebody else is

1121
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,599
working on part two and part one so then

1122
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,359
uh what I'll say the last little thing

1123
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,960
is just to show um a little preview of

1124
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:17,240
some of the things that we might be

1125
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,319
doing later and um I know it's not on

1126
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,640
the right screen I can make that bigger

1127
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:22,640
this is something I've been working on

1128
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,119
on an

1129
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,559
automatic um well let's let it run first

1130
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:31,559
on uh AI based

1131
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:35,359
automatically um trying to do labeling

1132
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:38,559
of Roman numerals based on um sets of

1133
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:41,200
pitches and training data what I've done

1134
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,040
is uh right now I'm only having it work

1135
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,880
with a few Roman

1136
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,200
numerals and always take a guess when

1137
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,960
you're trying to figure out what things

1138
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:54,680
are these how many entries are there one

1139
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:58,200
in each of these arrays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

1140
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:02,359
9 10 11 12 so these are the pitch

1141
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:05,440
classes above the um above the tonic of

1142
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:08,599
thing so that one has I can't even reach

1143
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:13,680
up there so that one has the most

1144
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:17,640
entries in you know call that c c sh d e

1145
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:20,559
flat o e that's quite a bit F fshp

1146
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,839
almost nothing G quite a bit and so this

1147
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,160
is how many times you see that chord

1148
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:28,039
tone in everything that in our labeled

1149
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:31,240
training data was was labeled one and so

1150
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:34,000
on for for five you see a lot of five

1151
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,720
scale degree five scale degree 7 and

1152
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,400
scale degree 2 kind of what you

1153
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,520
expect and put everything into um a

1154
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,160
neural net that I'm still trying to make

1155
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,520
this a little bit better a little bit

1156
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,799
better run it hopefully it's running um

1157
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:55,000
you can see run it through one time it's

1158
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:59,920
starting to get 62% accurate keep going

1159
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:03,240
up at 62 62 62 quite a long time jumps

1160
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:07,680
up 67 68 hopefully it's going pretty

1161
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:10,680
well eventually gets 87 88 90 and so on

1162
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,359
so it is possible to do this kind of

1163
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:17,440
things with today's um computational

1164
00:56:14,359 --> 00:56:19,839
resources kind of ending it around are

1165
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,599
we going to be able to get to 99

1166
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:25,920
today how big is it so that's what I'm

1167
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:27,559
gonna get to in just a second so so this

1168
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,440
oh of course my computer can barely

1169
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:33,520
handle this while projecting I think I

1170
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:37,079
did 400 um well while while it tries to

1171
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:41,119
scroll down to the bottom the danger is

1172
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:42,880
this data set took me years to get and

1173
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,599
it took years to put in this is the

1174
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:49,920
complete piano sonatas of

1175
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:53,640
Mozart complete piano sonatas of Mozart

1176
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:57,960
all labeled and when I divided it up

1177
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:00,160
into half training half test I still

1178
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,440
didn't have enough information for it to

1179
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,480
be able to get on so I'm dividing it

1180
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,720
into 90% training 10% test and that

1181
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:11,799
seems to be about what's there so the

1182
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,920
other thing was when I decided I oh this

1183
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:15,920
sounded like a fun project for over the

1184
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,520
holiday break so I thought you know I'd

1185
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,760
be able to present this on the first day

1186
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,760
of class or something I went in and the

1187
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,240
entire Roman numeral set could not be

1188
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,440
trusted because compared to the encoding

1189
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,599
of the things because people slightly

1190
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:35,359
disagreed on where measure 14 was or

1191
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:38,000
where measure 113 was or this Edition

1192
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:39,720
had this this part of the minuette uh

1193
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,640
the repeats were written out and they

1194
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,760
weren't so I was going through and when

1195
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,640
I was spot checking the Roman numerals

1196
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,520
just look totally wrong to me or it

1197
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:52,920
would say um Roman numeral placed after

1198
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:55,880
end of peace and so again it was about

1199
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,280
um I don't know it was about like like

1200
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,880
three hours a night for about three

1201
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,400
weeks of just okay well let's realign

1202
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,960
this one let's realign now it was a

1203
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,039
little bit less than that but some about

1204
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:10,000
two weeks maybe um so this ends up being

1205
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:11,559
one of the dangers and why I'm pushing

1206
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,440
even though I think we're starting to

1207
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:15,079
get how many EPO did I do this time I

1208
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,240
must have changed it but we're we're

1209
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:20,440
getting pretty close um and it takes a

1210
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,640
very long time before the computers

1211
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:27,280
being able to get things up um so these

1212
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:29,079
are some of the reasons why I'm going to

1213
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,119
teach you some of these techniques but

1214
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:33,240
then I'm going to encourage you not to

1215
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,400
use them on your final projects even

1216
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,640
though they're they are kind of the

1217
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,480
coolest new thing um going great any

1218
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,680
questions I'm sorry I'm not getting oh

1219
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:46,319
here we go finally we get to the done um

1220
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,280
and my computer's still so slow here's

1221
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,280
the mistakes that it was making oh this

1222
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,440
time it only got there um last time it

1223
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:59,480
got to all but all but one correct um

1224
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,839
yep but 177 times it saw one it

1225
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:05,160
predicted it one one time it saw it and

1226
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:07,359
predicted five um you can kind of

1227
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:10,480
imagine that four and two have some

1228
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:14,280
confusion with the computer and five and

1229
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:17,400
seven um also had some confusion six six

1230
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:19,319
and four have some confusion so um then

1231
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,160
the nice thing was actually going back

1232
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:26,280
the last time I did this and um looking

1233
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:29,400
at every place that there was um a

1234
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,400
confusion and saying ooh about half the

1235
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:36,760
time I agreed with the with the neur net

1236
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,760
and not with the professional encoder
