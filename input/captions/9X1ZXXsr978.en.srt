1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,180
Good morning.

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,660
My name is Carol Macon.

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,640
I'm the faculty lead for MITHIC.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,080
I want to extend a welcome
to everyone online watching

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,160
this, as well.

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,923
Thank you so much,
Rick and Agustín,

8
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:14,840
for that important
conversation, which I think

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,200
will resonate
throughout the day.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,095
So we have four sessions today.

11
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:20,720
And I'm just going
to talk a little bit

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,740
about the structure of them.

13
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,120
And then I'm going to disappear.

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,280
So I will come up
introduce the session.

15
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,760
We then will have two
presentations of research

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,680
that was supported by MITHIC.

17
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,520
A moderator will join
the presenters on stage

18
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,520
to lead a conversation
looking for common themes.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
And then I will return to stage.

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640
And I'll be here to moderate
questions and answers

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,780
from the audience.

22
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,620
So as you hear
these presentations,

23
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,480
do think about the
questions you may have.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,120
So our first session is on
two education initiatives

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,880
supported by MITHIC.

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,360
And I noticed that we have a
parallel to our first session

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,080
in that we had Agustín,
a philosopher, and Rick,

28
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,260
a political scientist.

29
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,819
We now have Kieran
Setiya, a philosopher,

30
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,180
and Lily Tsai, a
political scientist,

31
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,800
talking about their work.

32
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,400
So they'll be joined by
Melissa Nobles, our Chancellor,

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,780
to moderate the conversation.

34
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,913
But first, let's
start with Kieran.

35
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:20,364
[APPLAUSE]

36
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:27,760

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,720
Thank you so much.

38
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,003
As is appropriate for a
presentation about great books,

39
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:35,420
this is going to
be very low tech.

40
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,140
This is the only slide I have.

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,840
It will be almost
entirely papyrus-based.

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,760
Now what we're calling a
great books initiative at MIT

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,160
is, so far, a sequence
of two subjects,

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,840
Classics of Western Philosophy
offered in the fall,

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,940
and Ancient Authors offered
by literature in the spring.

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,620
The courses are
loosely integrated.

47
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,940
They have common themes.

48
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,220
There's minimal overlap.

49
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,160
So it would make
sense for a student

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,120
to take both, which
we're going to encourage.

51
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,502
They don't have a unified set
curriculum of great books.

52
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:06,960
And in each case,
the subjects were

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
ones we were really keen to
teach but unable to staff

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,940
reliably without
donor-directed funds.

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,760
So we have a three-year
pilot right now

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,240
for which we're
extremely grateful,

57
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,560
to race data and analog devices.

58
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,500
So why were we excited
about teaching great books?

59
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,280
And what does it mean
to talk in those terms?

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,800
There are grounds
for skepticism.

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
So great books, courses,
programs and colleges are

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,740
an artifact of the first
half of the 20th century,

63
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,480
beginning with John Erskine's
General Honors at Columbia

64
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,580
in 1920.

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,000
It was discontinued in 1928,
but then revived and revamped

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,960
as Literature
Humanities in 1937.

67
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,680
Meanwhile, Columbia
defector Mortimer Adler

68
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,660
left for Chicago in 1930.

69
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,480
And that took up the mantle
of great books education.

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,320
And then another landmark was
St. John's College Indianapolis

71
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,440
was the first college
devoted to a great books

72
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,080
curriculum in 1937.

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,480
If you flash forward to the
present, programs like these

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
are notable for their
relative absence.

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
And they've come
to be associated

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,720
with political
conservatism, and those

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,920
who advocate for great books
with a reactionary narrative

78
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,380
that has three parts that
I want to talk about.

79
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,360
So one is an idea that
the Western canon reflects

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,520
the key ideas,
democracy, liberalism,

81
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,720
maybe the scientific
method of something

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,920
called Western civilization.

83
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,140
The second idea is that
academics enamored of feminism,

84
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,760
post-colonialism, and
multiculturalism dismantled this

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,820
canon in the 1980s and 1990s.

86
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,720
And the third idea is that
the predictable result of this

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,200
was the decline of the
humanities, which had betrayed

88
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,680
their cultural inheritance.

89
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,612
Now every element of that
narrative is misleading.

90
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,820
In an essay on
Western civilization--

91
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,300
I encourage you to read it,
published in The Guardian--

92
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,800
Kwame Anthony Appiah argues that
there's really no such thing.

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,260
Now he begins with a
probably apocryphal anecdote.

94
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,740
But I'm going to
repeat it anyway,

95
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,698
which is that when he
was asked what he thought

96
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:13,560
of Western civilization, Mahatma
Gandhi is said to have replied,

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,440
I think it will be
a very good idea.

98
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
But where Gandhi implies
that the West was never

99
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,080
truly civilized, Appiah
goes one step further,

100
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,680
suggests that Western
civilization is a bad idea

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,840
intellectually.

102
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,240
It distorts our
understanding of history,

103
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,520
in part because the
meaning of the West

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,960
is so wildly
indeterminate, first

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,260
drawing a contrast
with the Islamic world,

106
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,980
later with the Orient.

107
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,920
And then in the
Cold War, contrast

108
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,740
with the other side
of the Iron Curtain,

109
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,160
more recently, part of a
more complicated contrast

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,200
with the Global South.

111
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,000
If we go back to the root,
Christianity versus Islam,

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,380
we find religious conflict,
but intellectual common ground.

113
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,900
So the fathers of Western
philosophy, Plato and Aristotle,

114
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,280
had their works preserved by
scholars in the Arab world.

115
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,060
And Muslim, Jewish and Christian
thinkers, Averroes or Ibn Rushd,

116
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,760
Maimonides, Aquinas, all did
the same thing of synthesizing

117
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,160
Aristotle with their different
monotheisms in the 12th and 13th

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,700
centuries.

119
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,320
They were all humming
the same tune.

120
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,640
The idea of the West as a
distinctive heritage seems to be

121
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,660
an invention of the 1890s.

122
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,080
And then it gets transformed
through the Cold War.

123
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,480
But actual
intellectual continuity

124
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,300
with Aquinas, let alone
Plato, is very minimal,

125
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,660
as slogans about liberalism
and democracy attest.

126
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,280
Neither Plato nor Aquinas
was a fan of either.

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,040
What about the university?

128
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,320
Did woke academics undermine the
Western canon, the Great Books

129
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,280
course, and with it
their own enrollments?

130
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,680
Not really.

131
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,500
It's true that the
canon was, I think,

132
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,590
rightly questioned and
expanded by academics.

133
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,990
I mean, insofar as
inclusion in the canon

134
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,790
is a function of influence,
it tracks social and political

135
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,630
power and the
injustice with which

136
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,790
that power has been exercised.

137
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,590
But courses like Erskine's
and Adler's were still

138
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,590
being offered, if
somewhat revised

139
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,470
and less commonly required.

140
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,870
And humanities enrollments
actually peaked in the 1990s.

141
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,710
So whatever was going on,
students were not put off by it.

142
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,230
Enrollments fell and
continued to fall,

143
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,070
not because of woke, but due to
external pressures, the soaring

144
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,070
cost of higher education,
increasing competition

145
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,070
for desirable jobs, the
mistaken sense that humanities

146
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,470
graduates are not employable,
and a consequent push

147
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,390
to tailor education more
directly to the needs of labor

148
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,270
markets.

149
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,430
MIT is in a special
position with respect

150
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,210
to this in many ways.

151
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,670
One is that the
issue of enrollment

152
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,470
is less relevant because the
supply of students in house

153
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,810
subjects is relatively fixed.

154
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,070
There was no bubble at MIT.

155
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,790
So if the conservative
narrative doesn't hold up,

156
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,870
what reason do we have to
revitalize the Great Books

157
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,030
course?

158
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,470
The short answer
is because there

159
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,990
is an urgent need for
students to grapple

160
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,750
with expansive questions about
human nature, human knowledge,

161
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,630
ethics, society, and politics.

162
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,130
When change is rapid
and unpredictable,

163
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,070
like the unfolding climate
crisis and the socially

164
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:28,550
disruptive impact of AI, we need
the wider horizons, imagination,

165
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,870
and creative insight
fostered by close engagement

166
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,390
with great books more than ever.

167
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,910
Now we know from
enrollment numbers

168
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,950
that when we're able to offer
classics of Western philosophy

169
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,410
consistently, students
want to take it.

170
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,910
The class size has doubled
over the last three years.

171
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,290
So we're not proposing
new requirements.

172
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,470
We're proposing
courses that we believe

173
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,870
students are excited to take.

174
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,410
Our focus on Western
philosophy, which I think,

175
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,470
unlike Western civilization,
does name something

176
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,230
blurrily coherent,
if rather porous,

177
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,790
is a concession to what
we're best equipped to teach.

178
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,310
That goes along
with self-awareness

179
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,030
about the limits of that
tradition and acknowledgment

180
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,970
of its indebtedness to others.

181
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,950
But given sufficient
resources, there's

182
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,470
a world in which SHASS could
offer a range of subjects

183
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,230
across geographic and cultural
borders that would introduce

184
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,910
students to far-reaching
questions about humanity

185
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,470
through other texts
and traditions flagged

186
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,510
as Great Books courses.

187
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,950
What exactly is the value
for students of spending

188
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,630
time with these books?

189
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,789
It's not to absorb a fixed
body of established wisdom.

190
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,190
It's to learn to
think for themselves

191
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,350
with the help of
living documents that

192
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,630
give historical perspective
and repay close study.

193
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,350
We sometimes argue for the
Humanities and Social Sciences

194
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,030
at MIT as sources of
knowledge and understanding,

195
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,950
of culture and history, society
and social change, ethics

196
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,590
and politics that will
make students better

197
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,190
people and better citizens.

198
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,550
We're not just
preparing MIT students

199
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,410
to land high-paying jobs,
but to solve human problems,

200
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,110
and so to make the
world a better place.

201
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,010
SHASS contributes to this.

202
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,430
And great books courses
can play an important role.

203
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,510
But if all we're
doing is creating

204
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,730
well-intentioned
problem solvers,

205
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,590
we're missing something vital.

206
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,150
I'm reminded of a quip
that was attributed

207
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,790
to the poet WH
Auden, who put words

208
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,150
in the mouth of a social worker.

209
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,910
Quote, "We are all here
on Earth to help others.

210
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,870
What on Earth the others
are here for, I don't know."

211
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,170
If the best we can hope
for is to solve problems,

212
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,830
we'd be better off not having to
face, why bother to live at all?

213
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,350
In the original
meaning, liberal arts

214
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,830
were understood in
opposition to servile arts

215
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,410
or vocational skills.

216
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,550
Liberal education was
fit for a free individual

217
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,610
working out their own
conception of how to live,

218
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,110
including the positive
goods that make life worth

219
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,950
living in the first place.

220
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,570
Art, music, and literature.

221
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,730
Love and friendship.

222
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,390
The beauty of scientific and
mathematical understanding.

223
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,250
Reading profound works of
literature and philosophy,

224
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,190
history and anthropology
can help us to do this.

225
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,230
Of course you could
still ask whether we

226
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,830
need to examine our own lives in
order to live fulfilling ones.

227
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,350
Maybe the unexamined
life can be worth living.

228
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,450
But unless you've
examined that question,

229
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,950
as you would in classics
of Western philosophy,

230
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,470
I'm afraid you're in
no position to say.

231
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,530
Thank you very much.

232
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,995
[APPLAUSE]

233
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:43,990

234
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,410
I'd like to introduce
Lily Tsai to the stage.

235
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,833
[APPLAUSE]

236
00:10:49,833 --> 00:11:06,470

237
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,150
Sometimes the world can
feel a little crazy.

238
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:15,230
That's because things are
changing fast, really fast.

239
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,630
It turns out, though,
that what we need to do

240
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:24,190
is not to move fast with it, but
to stop and reflect and think.

241
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,070
What kind of world
do we really want

242
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,910
to build so that
we're not constantly

243
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:34,110
overwhelmed by complexity
and chaos and noise?

244
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,270
MIT was originally
built to support

245
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,310
an industrial society,
one that was based

246
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,270
on machines and manufacturing.

247
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,870
Now we're transforming ourselves
for a digital age, one with AI

248
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,450
and computing and
synthetic biology.

249
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,620
And all of these things are
just making change faster.

250
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,270

251
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,270
More than ever, we need to
have moral, intellectual,

252
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,030
and aesthetic judgment.

253
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,390
These are the things
that AI cannot replace.

254
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,370
Don't get me wrong.

255
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,150
Some of my own research is on
designing AI for democracy.

256
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,150
But AI can't tell us if
something is beautiful.

257
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,350
It can't tell us
what a good idea is.

258
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:23,670
And it definitely can't tell us
what is right and what is wrong.

259
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,370
But if we're not
paying attention,

260
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,750
we're going to fall into
believing that AI can substitute

261
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,270
for these judgments.

262
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,630
So we need to
prepare our students

263
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,590
to reason for themselves
about hard human questions

264
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,790
so they can work together
to build the social fabric

265
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,150
and civic infrastructure
that we need for the future.

266
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,990
Compass teaches students to
build for the common good based

267
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,910
on clear principles and values,
investigated with rigorous tools

268
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,760
from the humanities,
arts, and social sciences.

269
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,375

270
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,750
The first thing that we've
done in the Compass Initiative

271
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,590
is to design a class with the
input of 31 faculty and 30

272
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,910
students from 22 departments.

273
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,450
It's truly a team effort.

274
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,950
And many people, including
Kieran, who I think

275
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,710
joined for our very first
organizational meeting,

276
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,230
and Susan Silbey.

277
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,550
And I'll call out also
Rebecca Sachs and especially

278
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,870
Emily Richmond Pollock, Adam
Albright, and Lila Friedland.

279
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,390
But it's truly a team
effort across the institute.

280
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,030
And it wouldn't be possible
without all of these people

281
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,510
to have all of Compass's
multiple facets.

282
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,390
Compass gets students to grapple
with hard human questions

283
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,310
and to read what great thinkers
have said about these questions.

284
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,950
It teaches students to
debate not in order to win,

285
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,870
but in order to
listen and understand.

286
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,350
Most importantly, we teach
students to apply all of this

287
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,670
to the rapidly changing
world around us.

288
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,950
Here's an example.

289
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,950
We start in the first
week by reflecting on what

290
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,030
holds communities together.

291
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,670
We read the US Constitution
and the Mayflower Compact

292
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,990
and the MIT value statement.

293
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,470
Then we discuss how great
philosophers like Thomas Hobbes

294
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,030
and John Locke and
Jean-Jacques Rousseau

295
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,470
have answered the
question of how

296
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,510
we can have liberty
and individual freedom,

297
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,350
yet still be constrained
to obey the laws

298
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,510
and rules of our communities.

299
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,870
After this, we get
students to apply

300
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,830
what they've learned by
collaborating to write a class

301
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,230
compact together.

302
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,510
You can see a copy of one
of these with the students'

303
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,310
signatures on the bottom.

304
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,170
So each week follows
this basic pattern.

305
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,510
Students read great thinkers.

306
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,430
They debate and deliberate
on a fundamental question

307
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,150
about human existence.

308
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,070
And then they apply it
to a real world problem.

309
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,670
We're hopefully
remaking a liberal arts

310
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,050
for the digital age.

311
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,470
But that's a talk
for another day.

312
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,230
In Compass, we investigate
three big questions.

313
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,190
And we keep coming back to them.

314
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,220
What do we value, and why?

315
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,790

316
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,190
What do we know?

317
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,270
And how do we know it?

318
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,530
And what do we
owe to each other?

319
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,350
What is the kind of world that
we want to build together?

320
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,070
After discussing John
Stuart Mill and Immanuel

321
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,990
Kant, virtue ethicists like
Aristotle and Confucius,

322
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,150
we map our personal values.

323
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,790
And we figure out whether or
not our professional values

324
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,630
in our fields reflect that.

325
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,670
We read Dante and Shakespeare.

326
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,150
This semester, we took students
to Verdi's Macbeth opera

327
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,470
and Beethoven's
Seventh Symphony.

328
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,070
And we asked them to
reflect on the value

329
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:08,830
of aesthetic and artistic
experience and expression.

330
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,750
By the end of the
semester, Compass students

331
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,870
have started to
surface the structure

332
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,310
and principles of history,
politics, science, poetry,

333
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,860
and music.

334
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,750

335
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,270
This focus on reasoning about
hard human questions using

336
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,090
rigorous tools from the many
disciplines in the humanities,

337
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,670
arts, and social
sciences is the essence

338
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,990
of Compass's unique approach.

339
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,350
Let me show you what I mean.

340
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,500
True or false, MIT
is a meritocracy.

341
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,920
If you ask a room full of
MIT students this question,

342
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,060
many, probably even
most of them, say true.

343
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,340
But why?

344
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,900
What does it mean
to be a meritocracy?

345
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,740
What is merit, even?

346
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,020
Is mathematical ability merit?

347
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,940
Is hard work merit?

348
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,740
And how would one
value these things

349
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,099
in the context of a university?

350
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,680
And how do we know
someone's merit?

351
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,420
Do we measure it with
problem sets and tests?

352
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,500
Or do we figure it
out some other way?

353
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,420
And once we know what
we value as merit

354
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,140
and how we know something
is meritorious, what

355
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,740
do we owe to those who have
merit in this context and those

356
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,340
who do not?

357
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,980
So you can see how a simple,
knee jerk, true-false response

358
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,500
quickly unspools into a long
string of difficult questions.

359
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,900
These kinds of questions need
the different disciplines

360
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,240
of philosophy, political
science, anthropology,

361
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,660
and history in order to
know how to reason about how

362
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,700
we should answer them.

363
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,620
You might ask,
why does it matter

364
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,260
if we can reason more rigorously
about these kinds of questions?

365
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,820
Well, one, it helps us
diagnose disagreements.

366
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,180
If two people disagree
about whether or not

367
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,820
MIT is a meritocracy, is
it because they disagree

368
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,620
about the values or
because they don't agree

369
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,060
about the facts on the ground?

370
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,780
Breaking down the
question allows

371
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,660
us to figure out the
points of agreement,

372
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,860
and maybe uncertainty,
and to be clear about what

373
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,860
we do disagree about.

374
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,980
Two, it invites us to be more
reflective and intentional

375
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
about our own beliefs.

376
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,780
If we think math
skills are meritorious,

377
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,740
are there other kinds
of merit that we

378
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,700
should prioritize just as
much based on the same logic?

379
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,940
Finally, it helps
us take action.

380
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,140
If we're in a position of power.

381
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,460
What kinds of decisions
would accomplish

382
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,830
the rewarding of merit?

383
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,460

384
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,220
MIT students need to be fluent
in reasoning about answers

385
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,580
to these hard human questions.

386
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,200
Some of them will
become engineers.

387
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,300
And they'll need to know
the values and impacts

388
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,780
of the systems they design.

389
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,320
Some will become
parents or educators.

390
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,660
And they'll need to know
what to reward and why.

391
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,000
Many of them will
become leaders.

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,420
And they'll have to make
policies and decisions that

393
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,580
influence institutional
and societal structures.

394
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,540
And all, we hope, will
face disagreements

395
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,580
about hard questions
with respect and humility

396
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,200
and tools for
understanding differences.

397
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,860

398
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,780
The multidisciplinarity
of Compass

399
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,620
gives people all the puzzle
pieces together at one table

400
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,380
to understand, what are the
multisystemic challenges

401
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,860
of the digital era?

402
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,380
I don't know of any
other place where

403
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,940
an approach this deep
and complex is happening.

404
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,760
Even though we've just
started piloting it,

405
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,460
people and
communities are asking

406
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,540
us to build a version
of Compass for them.

407
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,940
And I get why students
have been writing

408
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,940
in their anonymous
feedback cards things

409
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,740
like, I wish
classes were longer.

410
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,660
Those of you who are
students and faculty

411
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,380
know this doesn't always happen.

412
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,220
You can see one student has
written on their index card

413
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,420
something like, banger
class, absolute cinema.

414
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,540
And I actually don't
know what that means.

415
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,660
But I think it's positive.

416
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,700
Some of the professors
who teach Compass--

417
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,260
and some of you are here today--

418
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,740
are doing this beyond
our regular course load.

419
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,140
That's how much it means to us.

420
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,200
Compass aims to give people
the habits, tools, knowledge,

421
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,620
and capacity to act
from their own most

422
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,900
fundamental commitments.

423
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,872
And people are really
craving this capacity.

424
00:20:55,872 --> 00:20:58,740

425
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,460
We all know that MIT has
always existed to do good

426
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,300
for the nation and the public.

427
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,420
And we're not just
educating technical leaders.

428
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,660
We're also educating
citizens, civic leaders,

429
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,620
and whole human
beings that will be

430
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,220
functioning in the digital age.

431
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,580
At Compass, our mission is to
help students see themselves

432
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,060
that way so they leave ready to
build, both for the joy of it

433
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,380
and for the greater good of it.

434
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,564
Thank you.

435
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:34,952
[APPLAUSE]

436
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:37,860

437
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,180
So I'll now be joined by
Chancellor Nobles and Kieran

438
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,400
Setiya for the panel
part of the discussion.

439
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,885

440
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:53,760
Where do you want us?

441
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,520

442
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,860
Good morning, everyone.

443
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,820
Can you hear me?

444
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,320
Yeah.

445
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,860
Great.

446
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,840
Well, this is terrific.

447
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,340
Thank you.

448
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm Melissa Nobles,
I already said,

449
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,660
but they told me I had
to reintroduce myself.

450
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,463
So I have a few
questions to start.

451
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,880
I think we're going to go about
15 minutes with questions.

452
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,380
And then we're going to have
questions from the audience.

453
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,700
I'll begin.

454
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,800
The first-- I'm going to
start with you, Kieran.

455
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,740
So I was reading
yesterday-- it's

456
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,320
connected to what
you were saying,

457
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,040
but from a different angle.

458
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,860
So in The Chronicle
of Higher Education,

459
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,300
Danielle Allen at
Harvard wrote a piece

460
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,800
about returning to the
classics in the age of AI.

461
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,960
And I thought, OK,
this is for you.

462
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,280
And so she said that
part of the challenge,

463
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,680
and I think we heard
it this morning,

464
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,420
is that AI is, as she says,
a part of the story, but not

465
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,060
the only part of what ails us.

466
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,900
That we live in an era where
capital-intensive tech companies

467
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,580
are fracking our attention
with addictive algorithms

468
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,980
designed to force every
bit of our attention

469
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,060
to the surface for monetization
for advertising revenue.

470
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,560
She goes on.

471
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,300
But the point is
that young people

472
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,300
are beset by an epidemic
of anxiety and distraction.

473
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,060
She claims that
returning to the classics

474
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,740
will help cure that addiction.

475
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,620
What say you?

476
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,046
I think it's both
a challenge and--

477
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:32,360
and this is the MIT response
and a huge opportunity.

478
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,500
So yeah, I think
one of the things

479
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,340
about reading Plato or
Margaret Cavendish, who's

480
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,280
a early modern philosopher who
wrote the first science fiction,

481
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,420
these books are hard.

482
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,680
And they're often very alien.

483
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,540
I mean, we think of the idea of
the Western tradition suggests

484
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,360
familiarity.

485
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,660
But actually, the
strangeness of these books

486
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,940
and the demandingness of
them is central to why

487
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,840
they're interesting and
worth engaging with.

488
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,298
So I think one of
the things that's

489
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:01,500
very hard in teaching
classics of Western philosophy

490
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,380
or any kind of
great books course

491
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,540
is that part of the
pedagogical goal

492
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,200
is teaching students
how to read.

493
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,580
But how do you read
something long and sustained?

494
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,300
And we think of that
self-consciously.

495
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,363
So part of the
curriculum is, how

496
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:17,780
do you read a book
that you're not

497
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,980
going to understand
first time, a book that

498
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,560
is extremely challenging?

499
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,733
And how do you create space in
which students have the leisure

500
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,900
and luxury to do that, and
the incentive to do that,

501
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,180
because they'll be part of a
conversation in which they're

502
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,980
accountable for having
done it, but also

503
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,480
get to share their
reactions with others.

504
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,297
And I will say, I think the
goal-- this is aspirational--

505
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:39,380
but I think it's not
unrealistic-- is what we want

506
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,900
to do is not just
to create students

507
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,908
who can read
difficult books, it's

508
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:44,200
students who want to read them.

509
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,617
There's this
wonderful formulation

510
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,900
from the critic
Gayatri Spivak, who

511
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,980
describes humanities
education as the non-coercive

512
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,620
rearrangement of desire.

513
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,260
And I love that formulation.

514
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,340
What we want is students to
leave a course like this wanting

515
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,100
to continue reading
difficult books,

516
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,280
engage with difficult ideas.

517
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,780
And then there's a
further challenge

518
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,988
for academics like me, which
is we have to then write

519
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:07,460
the books that they can read.

520
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,060
That's another story.

521
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,780
I think this can be a venue for
tackling that problem if we're

522
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,120
self-conscious about it.

523
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,980
Right, I'm going to
be a bit provocative.

524
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,200
So you can imagine a
student saying, I mean,

525
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,020
when we were growing up back
in the day, it was Cliff Notes.

526
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,400
What would make a student
not think about that again,

527
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,280
even if they're open to the
challenges you're describing?

528
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,320
And I have no doubt that
students will be open to it.

529
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,004
But how would you--

530
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,580

531
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,720
I'm asking you to think
in the future, of course,

532
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,700
how to manage that in a way that
deals with the current reality

533
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,740
and still gets at what you
describe, which I would agree

534
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,810
is very important.

535
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,560
I mean, I think there's
two sides to that.

536
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,080
One is classroom management.

537
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,300
How do you deter students
from taking shortcuts that

538
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,885
will impede their education?

539
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:00,260
And there are also
things you can

540
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,420
do in the class in terms
of testing or setting up

541
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,660
classroom settings in
which they're writing

542
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,798
without access to AI and so on.

543
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:09,840
The other part of it, I
think, is about modeling.

544
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,740
I mean, one thing about teaching
a course in which you read

545
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,620
Plato or Margaret Cavendish is
that going back to those texts

546
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,430
is energizing for the teacher.

547
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,620
You find something
new every time.

548
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,400
And modeling to them that I've
been doing this for 25 years.

549
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,580
But I need to read
this again because I'm

550
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,140
going to see new things
is a way of showing them

551
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,200
that what you get if
you ask AI to summarize

552
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,940
this is not the thing itself.

553
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,260
And hopefully sharing that
excitement and novelty

554
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,020
of actually engaging with the
richness of the original texts

555
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,520
is something we can
do in the class.

556
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,980
So I think it's a mixture
of thinking about strategies

557
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,220
for managing the classroom
that limit access or limit

558
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,420
the incentives, and
partly really just trying

559
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,140
to make the case by
example, that there's

560
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,820
a kind of intellectual
excitement

561
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,220
that their teachers get and that
they can share that would just

562
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,220
not be available if what they
were dealing with was, ChatGPT,

563
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,700
could you summarize
Plato's Republic?

564
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,680
Maybe I can share.

565
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,552
Yes, please.

566
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:12,760
I was going to ask you, Lily.

567
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,083
Go ahead.

568
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,500
I mean, it's
actually really funny

569
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,420
because I was
actually at Harvard

570
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,060
a couple of weeks
ago at a workshop

571
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,740
that Danielle Allen organized
on trying to design something

572
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,500
like Compass at Harvard.

573
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
And one of the things
we talked about

574
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,110
was actually something
that came up,

575
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,570
I think, in the conversation
between Dean Ryan and Dean Locke

576
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,990
earlier about meeting
students where they are.

577
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:41,030
And so it is true, attention
has been fracked, actually.

578
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,290
And I think that that's
just an empirical reality

579
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,890
that we have to adjust
our pedagogy in order

580
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,950
to accommodate.

581
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,090
And so one of the things
that we've tried out

582
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,690
in Compass to create a success
is actually getting the students

583
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,730
in the classroom to do a table
read of Shakespeare's Macbeth

584
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,450
from front to back.

585
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,210
So we sat in a room
for three hours.

586
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,250
And a group of us
read Macbeth together.

587
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,690
This is actually a
little bit like something

588
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,770
I think colleagues at
Virginia Tech are doing,

589
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,770
where they have a class
that's eight hours long.

590
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,090
For the first six hours,
you sit in a room.

591
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,390
And you read together.

592
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,390
And then the last two hours,
you discuss what you've read.

593
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,010
And it's incredibly
popular, apparently.

594
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,290
So I think this is actually
an opportunity for us

595
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,170
to become really, really
creative about pedagogy.

596
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,110
Another thing that I think
is interesting is that--

597
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,990
and students, as
Kieran is saying,

598
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,230
want to be held
accountable, actually,

599
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,890
for doing difficult things.

600
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,230
MIT students love to do
the most difficult things.

601
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,050
And so when we got them
to debate and deliberate

602
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,810
about the kind of
class constitution

603
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,330
they wanted to write for
themselves this semester,

604
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,090
a lot of them
actually said, we want

605
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,950
to be held accountable
for our reading.

606
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,770
And so luckily, we had
actually already instituted

607
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,470
reading quizzes.

608
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,330
And so they were
like, that's great.

609
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,750
That can be an implicit
part of the class compact.

610
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,650
So I think there's a
hunger for it, actually.

611
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,250
As Kieran is
saying, it's getting

612
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,730
students who want to do
difficult things, who

613
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,070
want to grapple with
difficult ideas.

614
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,968
And this is exactly what MIT
students are so special at.

615
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,010
Yeah, I will say just
briefly, to follow up, just

616
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,310
in total agreement with that.

617
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,610
One thing we're extraordinarily
lucky at with MIT

618
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,590
is the students are
totally wonderful.

619
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,290
And my experience of
the AI opportunities

620
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,290
is that it sort of saved
us from ourselves is often

621
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:34,970
their attitude.

622
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,270
It's a collective
action problem.

623
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,743
They don't want
to take shortcuts.

624
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:41,910
But the temptation is there.

625
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,330
And so I think they will
collaborate with initiatives

626
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,450
in the classroom to make the
experience more intellectually

627
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,450
satisfying.

628
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,770
So in a way, both of
you are describing

629
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:56,790
a place where the classroom is
becoming a safe space of sorts.

630
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,090
I mean, a different kind
of space, a space where

631
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,170
time is differently--

632
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,770
For attention.

633
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,710
--experienced.

634
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,510
Oh, yes.

635
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,930
Absolutely.

636
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,330
And I think it's so interesting
to watch students in Compass,

637
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,410
because they really
relish this time together.

638
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,110
It's a space where
it's safe, I suppose.

639
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,010
But what's more
interesting is that it's

640
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,490
a place where they can be free.

641
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:23,330
It's like a space where they can
freely discuss and debate things

642
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,930
with each other and
build relationships

643
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,130
and a sense of community around
these fundamental questions

644
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,050
that, frankly, all of us will
struggle with our entire life.

645
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,930
So space, just to clarify,
I meant, yes, safe

646
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:42,290
from devices, or from
the attention, the siren

647
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,570
call of those--

648
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,490
Oh, the devices.

649
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,990
Of the devices.

650
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,530
So, Lily, thinking
about the Compass class,

651
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,470
one of the things I thought, I
mean, first, it's just amazing.

652
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,390
I read the report.

653
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,250
It's something to see
the levels of engagement

654
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,690
of both faculty and students.

655
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,930
And the readouts of
the student reports

656
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,498
were really quite positive.

657
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,290
But one of the things
that you wonder about

658
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,690
is, what lessons is
it possible to know?

659
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,710
But I imagine all
of us are wondering.

660
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,190
So what happens after that?

661
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,970
So you take this great class.

662
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,170
And there are some things that
are stirred within, presumably.

663
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,826
And the students
take that forward.

664
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:26,770
Are there ways of figuring
out how students are

665
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,710
bringing those things forward?

666
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,690
Are they becoming
evangelists of sorts?

667
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,410
Are they perhaps
expressing more interest

668
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,390
in taking SHASS and
other kinds of courses,

669
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,310
non-technical courses,
as a consequence?

670
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,125
I mean, I imagine that would
be our expectation and hope.

671
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,250
But I'd be curious to know.

672
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,470
I know it's pretty early on.

673
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,073
So I'm asking prematurely.

674
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:46,990
But I wonder if you have
any views about that.

675
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,630
Yeah, I mean, when we
started Compass-- again,

676
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,290
also with the help and
support of race data--

677
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,170
one of the things that
we really committed to

678
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,290
was actually making this
a learning experience

679
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,270
for the faculty.

680
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,330
And part of that is
actually making sure

681
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,290
that we're following
students in their journey

682
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,570
through MIT over
four years and seeing

683
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,790
what they're bringing from
Compass through that journey.

684
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,050
And so one of the things that
we've asked students is, are you

685
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,930
more likely to take a class?

686
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,930
Or what disciplines are
you more likely to take

687
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,930
a class in that you
wouldn't have actually known

688
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,050
about before?

689
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,010
And so we have data
on things like,

690
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,370
are they taking linguistics?

691
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,570
Are they taking philosophy?

692
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,130
Or are they taking
anthropology and sociology?

693
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,650
So that's one way in which
we're learning about how

694
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,530
Compass affects their journey.

695
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,570
The second thing
that's been interesting

696
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,672
is that people seem to want
something like Compass.

697
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:44,130
They want an
opportunity to grapple

698
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,930
with great books
and great thinkers

699
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,850
and these fundamental
questions at inflection points

700
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,750
in their life.

701
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,970
So we've had second
semester seniors

702
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,390
ask if we could have a
Compass version just for that,

703
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,230
because they're just about to
go out into the real world.

704
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,130
And they want a time to
think about those questions.

705
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,330
Somebody from Sloan's Executive
MBA program actually asked if we

706
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,370
could do something for
40-year-old mid-career MBAs

707
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,970
because they, too, have had 20
years of professional success.

708
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,010
And they're wondering what
they want their legacy to be.

709
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,450
And so that's been
really interesting.

710
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,550
Finally, we're also
like Concourse,

711
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,450
which is another fantastic
program at MIT that

712
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,150
has many of the same goals
that Kieran and I have.

713
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,410

714
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,170
We've learned from Concourse
that one way to continue

715
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,090
this journey with
these questions

716
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,450
and great thinkers is to involve
Compass alumni in becoming

717
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,507
TAs for Compass, because
there is this kind of-- oh,

718
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:51,090
Esther's here.

719
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,310
I didn't even see you here.

720
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,250
Esther Duflo is also
part of the Compass team.

721
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,930
One of the great ways
of solidifying things

722
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,270
is that kind of thing that
you hear from medicine.

723
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,950
You see one, do one, teach one.

724
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,250
And at MIT, we've figured
out doing, learning by doing

725
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,514
is incredibly important.

726
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,889
But this is also
a way of getting

727
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,449
them to learn by teaching.

728
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,969
That's terrific.

729
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,210
I have just a couple
of minutes left

730
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,590
before we turn to the audience.

731
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,690
So I talk a lot about his
chaffs about the whole student.

732
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,630
And a big part of
that is the classroom.

733
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,170
But another part
of it is outside

734
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,850
of the classroom,
so which is part

735
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,490
of the reason why I was asking.

736
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,469
Both of your descriptions
of your classes

737
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,250
are, it sounds at
the end, a commitment

738
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,770
to making our students
just better people.

739
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,210
So it's as much a story of
inviting self-examination

740
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,570
as it is imparting
screaming at students,

741
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,350
but more stirring
the self-learning.

742
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:56,489

743
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:02,210
As both professors, how
has it affected you?

744
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,055
Because here's the
challenge, is that we

745
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:06,430
may have all taken these
classes when we were in college.

746
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,410
But we came of age
at a different time.

747
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,010
So how do you meet students
where they are, but also

748
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,890
recognize that you
are we all are being

749
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,590
changed by our current moment?

750
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:21,570
Do these classes help you?

751
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,910
Yes.

752
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,730
I mean, it's been amazing.

753
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,050
I think part of the reason
the faculty are willing--

754
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,450
the faculty on the campus
teaching teams and design

755
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,690
teams are willing to
put all of this effort

756
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,650
above and beyond their
regular teaching loads

757
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,310
is because we're all
learning from each other.

758
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,770
And it's really like a
master class in learning.

759
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,330
And I actually wish there
were more opportunities at MIT

760
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,450
to do something like
this because all of us

761
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,690
are learning from Esther.

762
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,330
When do you get to take a
class, a little mini class,

763
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,090
from a Nobel
Prize-winning economist?

764
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,290
Or Sally Haslanger
and Alex Byrne, these

765
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,070
are amazing philosophers.

766
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,570
And you get to sit there.

767
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,350
I'm a political scientist.

768
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,850
And I get to sit there and hear
what these philosophers think

769
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,090
about cutting-edge thinking.

770
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,070
So I think that's been
intellectually enriching.

771
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:17,730
And I think we also try to have
Compass co-taught by professors

772
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,430
from different disciplines.

773
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,170
And both for the teachers
and for the students watching

774
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,850
that kind of interdisciplinary
conversation, is just,

775
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,330
it's a very rare experience.

776
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,250
And it models interdisciplinary
collaboration and debate

777
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,290
that we need, again, to address
these kinds of challenges that

778
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,950
are going to be multi-systemic.

779
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,410
You have to have people
who are able to translate

780
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,530
across disciplines and figure
out where the synergies can be.

781
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,250
And we're hoping to model that.

782
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,592
Yes?

783
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:52,050
Just to add, the
only thing I would

784
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,070
add to that, which I
totally agree with,

785
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,830
is there's also just
learning from the students.

786
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,650
So one thing about manifesting
the freshness of going back

787
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,250
to a text you've
read many times is

788
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,130
that the students will notice
things that you didn't notice.

789
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,490
And I think it's really
exhilarating for a student

790
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:13,290
in a class to make an argument
and have the professor go,

791
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,710
I never thought of it that way.

792
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,890
You're a genius.

793
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,930
And I think that I
learn a huge amount

794
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,110
from the students in more or
less every class I teach at MIT.

795
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,570
But I think this is that's
one way in which they can come

796
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,370
to see that they're
part of a conversation

797
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:32,050
that they wouldn't get
if they took shortcuts.

798
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,900
Thank you.

799
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,150
So it's time for the audience.

800
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,670
I've asked my questions.

801
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,930
They are roaming,
roving mics, I think.

802
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,170
That's right.

803
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,330
First question,
over at the back.

804
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,050
Hi, thank you very much.

805
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,830
This is wonderful and
exciting and encouraging.

806
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,770
I'm just curious if you could
talk a little bit more about,

807
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,875
you both mentioned great
books and great thinkers.

808
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,250
And I'm just wondering if you
could say a little bit more

809
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:01,770
about what makes a book great,
what makes a thinker great.

810
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,730
Thank you.

811
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,410
That is a very--

812
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,827
I mean, it's a
very hard question.

813
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:08,610
I think one way to think
about the criterion we've

814
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,850
tended to use is, what are the
books that have the feature that

815
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,930
returning to them and
engaging with them again

816
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,080
and again and again is going
to be incredibly intellectually

817
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,240
productive?

818
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,260
And I think we're fairly
open ended in what counts.

819
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,640
So one thing about the
two-semester sequence

820
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,540
is we're coordinating.

821
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,940
But we didn't come up
with a fixed curriculum.

822
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,880
It's not like there's
a list in which we've

823
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,300
had to answer the question,
what are the great books?

824
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,240
It's more that we
were, what are books

825
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,200
that are in conversation
with each other,

826
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,540
and that students will find
fruitful to engage with,

827
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,780
professors will find
fruitful to engage with,

828
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,033
that will enable them to think
deeply about how society should

829
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:49,700
be structured, how
life should be lived,

830
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,120
what the role of technology in
life and in society should be?

831
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,640
But yeah, we have not tried
to pin down a canon more

832
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,160
determinedly than that.

833
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,560
Yeah, thank you, Linda,
for that amazing question.

834
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,560
This is Linda Rabieh,
who's one of MIT'S

835
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,640
amazing political philosophers.

836
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,320
And I think when I think
about that question,

837
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,480
I think we have a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist, Sam

838
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,600
Ting.

839
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,280
And he once said
that in physics,

840
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,860
what is really important is
having the best data possible.

841
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,660
And interpretations of the data,
models of the data come and go.

842
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,360
But as long as you have
the best data possible,

843
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,960
that will stand
the test of time.

844
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,040
The way I think
about great works

845
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,680
is that there's
material in there

846
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,200
that people can continue
to engage with in order

847
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,840
to refine, again, their moral,
intellectual, and artistic

848
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,960
judgment.

849
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,720
So it's through that
process of engaging

850
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,880
with this really
rich material that

851
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,680
enables them to enables us
to sharpen our discernment

852
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,340
and judgment.

853
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,058
And that's what I think of.

854
00:40:03,058 --> 00:40:04,600
But of course, people
should actually

855
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,520
also ask Linda what she
thinks of that question.

856
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,840
Michael, yeah.

857
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,400
Thank you.

858
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,880
All this has been wonderful.

859
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,160
I have a question, I
guess, for both of you,

860
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,200
more towards the
Great books program.

861
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,560
I have spoken with many
alumni, our older alumni

862
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,300
from MIT who took great
books classes like this,

863
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,920
and really credited it as one of
the fundamental distinguishing

864
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,960
blocks of their MIT education,
that it helped them stand out

865
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,480
from other engineers who had
only technical educations,

866
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,220
and from colleagues from Harvard
who had no technical education,

867
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,520
but that they were
able to have them both.

868
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,680
How would you speak about
what we're doing today

869
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,677
to that audience of
alumni who really valued

870
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:53,260
that part of their education,
what is what you're doing today?

871
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,200
How is it different?

872
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,420
And how is it similar?

873
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,800
And I think I would ask
the same on the Compass.

874
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,760
How is what you're doing today--

875
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,840
how does it relate to
that MIT tradition?

876
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,560
And how does it bring
it forward in a new way?

877
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,500
I mean, I do think it's a
revival of that tradition.

878
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
I think there are logistical
ways in which it's different,

879
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:18,480
which is that the broadening
of students ethical and social

880
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,240
understanding right now is
under the auspices of the Haas

881
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,860
requirement.

882
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,740
And it's very dispersed.

883
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,340
You can take all kinds
of different things.

884
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,007
And right now, we're
not thinking, well,

885
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,460
we want to introduce
requirements.

886
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,840
But I do think the salience
of these courses, the student

887
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,020
demand for them is there.

888
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,560
And I think they can
be brought to recognize

889
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,320
that these courses can play the
kind of role they were playing

890
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,120
at that earlier moment.

891
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,100
And so I think
there's continuity.

892
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,480
I think there's
probably a greater

893
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,700
flexibility in understanding
what the canon is.

894
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,720
I think you just would read a
more diverse range of culturally

895
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,320
diverse, geographically
diverse range of thinkers

896
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,520
in a classics of Western
philosophy course

897
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,920
now than might have
been true when people

898
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,560
had more of a fixed curriculum.

899
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,480
And I think there's
probably more

900
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,800
attentiveness on
the pedagogical side

901
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,100
to the difficulty of doing this.

902
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,520
So I suspect that when people
were teaching these courses

903
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,600
in 1955 or 1970,
there was a sense

904
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,120
that students were prepared
to read books like this.

905
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,080
There wasn't this
crisis of attention.

906
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
And so one way in which
I think this has changed

907
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,880
is that we do think of
ourselves as not just imparting

908
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,368
great ideas, but imparting
skills of attention

909
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:41,660
that I think students can
then carry on into the world.

910
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,480
And that is a new challenge
that I think classes like this

911
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,200
and like Compass can
really help to address.

912
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,180
So I've been asked to keep
the trains running on time.

913
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,920
So we will have an
opportunity at lunchtime

914
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,140
to continue the conversation.

915
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,800
But for right now, I'd like to
thank Lily, Kieran, and Melissa

916
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,200
for this wonderful chat.

917
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,780
Thank you.

918
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,130
[APPLAUSE]

919
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:11,000
