00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,480
hi everyone I'm Samy shalabi MIT Alum

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:10,480
and uh founder and CTO of Maven AGI

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,880
where we're reimagining customer

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,880
experience through AI

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,760
agents customer experience is really

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,519
really

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,519
broken if any of you remember a good

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,119
customer experience raise your hand that

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,000
you've ever had with a vendor it's a

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,760
universally very

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,160
challenging uh uh environment to be able

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,440
to create great customer first off it's

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,160
insanely

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,760
expensive we've canvased hundreds and

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,840
hundreds of Enterprise organizations and

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,320
asked them how much does it cost you to

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,239
support your customers universally the

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,719
number that comes back it's an average

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,960
of $40 a ticket $40 to handle a support

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,039
ticket where in general most people are

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,000
frustrated with the overall experience

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,879
you take that to other parts of customer

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,439
experience like customer success every

24
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,439
interaction is over

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,840
$100 this is not this is not because the

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,520
organizations are not trying to create a

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,960
great experience it's because it's a

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,200
complicated experience it's got numerous

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,960
handoffs the systems are fragmented

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,680
there's a lot of lack of Automation and

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,479
there's just a ton of really bad

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,560
self-service tools on average a support

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,000
agent needs to use six systems to be

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,640
able to answer any question that

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,159
typically comes

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,920
in what we're building at Maven are AI

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,119
agents imagine if you contact support

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,479
and the person talking to you knows

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,880
everything about you everything about

40
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,880
the company and is a domain expert and

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,119
not only is telling you how to do stuff

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,360
is personalizing the experience and is

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,840
able to take actions on your behalf to

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,320
solve your problems we are a we are

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,960
building AI that can do that

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,920
in support so how can these AI agents be

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,679
used in support and there are three

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,080
highlevel use cases for users for our

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,680
customers customers uh you can use AI

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,120
agents to help drive a self-service

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,519
experience where users are able to solve

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,239
their own problems that drives an

53
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,080
increase in ticket deflection Which is

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,200
less human agents less cost and more

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,840
self-service and faster time to uh uh

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,840
service

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,959
for agents the folks on the other side

58
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,319
AI agents can be used to help with

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,920
assist agents to actually solve the the

60
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,200
tickets and in this in in in this

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,920
experience it helps for drive at uh uh

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,000
agent efficiency and it drives better

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,720
consistency for all users submitting

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,959
these tickets and then lastly for uh uh

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,280
support leaders using AI agents you're

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,680
able to understand the state of your

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,319
support environment when you have

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,040
hundreds and hundreds in some case some

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,120
of our customers millions of tickets

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,400
it's very hard to figure out what's what

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,200
and where the issues are and using AI

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,599
we're able to categorize and organize

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,879
and present a unified view of where the

74
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,239
issues are ultimately driving better

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,120
issue visibility and Al ultimately

76
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,120
fitting it back to the solution and and

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,120
and really solving these customer

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,640
issues so let's look at a real example

79
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,040
in this case this is a personalized chat

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,239
agent that was embedded into a SAS

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,200
product and in this case the maven agent

82
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,959
is loaded it see it's able to retrieve

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,599
the user's profile and figure out that

84
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,200
the user needs uh to verify their

85
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,920
profile so this is very turning support

86
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,519
into not just a self-service but a

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,879
proactive experience and then the

88
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,799
customer asks the question why do I need

89
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,920
to verify and is able to answer that

90
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,920
question in a fairly unified way

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,000
ultimately reducing uh the need to

92
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,920
deflect the

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,040
ticket this is another example

94
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,040
where the user's trying to perform an

95
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,760
action and hasn't been able to figure

96
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,519
out out and this is using our full full

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,639
page chat experience similar to chat gbt

98
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,160
where the user says I just want to

99
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,680
change permissions it's able to

100
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,120
disambiguate well there are two people

101
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,120
with the first name Sammy and the user

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,039
is able to select and then the action is

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,840
and removing all the complexity

104
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,759
necessary to navigate complicated

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,800
products let's look at a different

106
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,680
example in the case of helping agents

107
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,400
this is an example of the maven coil it

108
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,520
coexisting inside of zenis we support

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,199
every desk there is Salesforce fresh Des

110
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,199
send uh uh slack twio every kind of

111
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,479
support system out there and the

112
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,280
co-pilot coexists in this experience in

113
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,360
this particular example the the ticket

114
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,479
came in Spanish the or the agent only

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,960
speaks English and answer is generated

116
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,960
in Spanish and translated to

117
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,840
English and the agent is able to edit

118
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,919
the answer in English and it's

119
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,720
automatically translated back to Spanish

120
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,440
and when we've talked to many of our

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
customers uh the multi- language use

122
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,360
case is is where this the costs are

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,400
astronomically High English to English

124
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,440
is usually about $40 anything in any

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,400
foreign language typically runs around

126
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,840
$120 per ticket at

127
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,720
least and finally AI driven analytics to

128
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,639
help understand overall efficiency and

129
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,960
we have dashboards not only is it just

130
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,639
about solving the problem is mayen

131
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,400
working for you but giving you Insight

132
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,520
we automatically categorize tickets

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,120
compute nps's it slice and dice the data

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,680
so you have true visibility into your

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,160
overall support

136
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,000
experience and these these are some of

137
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,600
the results we've we've had with our

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,560
Enterprise customers we' processed

139
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,199
millions of tickets now um uh on average

140
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,360
our AI agents are able to handle

141
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,800
93% of support questions without

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,000
humans and the typical savings is 80%

143
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,199
and we've had significant increases in

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,840
resolution times uh uh and we've pretty

145
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,240
much integrated with everything out

146
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,199
there and we're happy to integrate with

147
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,919
more and we have uh uh quite a bit of

148
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,160
large Enterprise customers that are

149
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,319
really happy with our solution this is

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,520
uh uh open AI saw the work we were doing

151
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,680
with Trip Advisor and if you go open.com

152
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,479
there is a detailed case study around

153
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,240
the work that we've done with Trip

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,360
Advisor where in their case they were

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,400
able to answer 90% of their incoming

156
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,400
queries without

157
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,880
humans if you are looking to improve

158
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,800
your overall support experience cut cost

159
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,160
we're open for business we're excited to

160
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:59,319
work across Industries and we're we we

161
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,319
can see you around the corner thank you
