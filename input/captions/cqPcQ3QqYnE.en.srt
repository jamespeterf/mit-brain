1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,920
Welcome back open courseware. So um

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,960
we're talking about random variables and

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,039
expectation and in fact uh one theme

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
that I want to mention is that uh you

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
know a bunch of our probability lectures

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,240
will be about how to get tools that give

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,560
us a finer grain control of how random

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,439
variables behave. At the end of today's

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,040
lecture we're going to talk about

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
variance and later on we're going to

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,680
talk about things like tail bounds. All

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,200
right. So, let me start off with the

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
main motivating problem that we're going

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
to spend, you know, the first part of

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,040
class talking about. This is a

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
challenging problem that um usually the

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,640
way I would get students attention was I

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,399
would say that uh you know, if you're

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
going to do tech or finance interviews,

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
this is the kind of thing that they ask

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,920
you during the interviews. But the truth

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
is that everyone knows that they ask

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
this. So, they no longer ask this

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,840
anymore. But, it's still a really fun

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,479
problem to think about. So imagine we

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,880
have n students in class and they each

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,720
turn in their pet sets we grade them and

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
then instead of you know figuring out

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,439
who's who we just randomly give out pet

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,200
sets to different students. Well one of

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,200
the probability questions we can ask

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,680
which will you know be an excuse to

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,159
learn a very important tool is we'll be

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,680
interested in what's the probability

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:33,159
that we get everything wrong. So no one

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,159
gets their correct P set.

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,119
Okay. So we're going to see a a very

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,040
important tool called inclusion

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,439
exclusion in order to answer this

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,920
question. But let's build up towards it

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,520
and get some intuition. So the first

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
thing I want to do is I want to

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,040
understand this probability of this very

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,439
complicated thing by breaking it up into

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,439
simpler events. So what I'm going to do

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,000
is I'm going to define a bunch of helper

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,040
events that'll help me compute this

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,560
probability. So I'm going to let AI

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:13,959
denote the event that the IT student

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,959
gets their correct P set.

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,720
So you can think about event a few

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,280
different ways, right? An event is

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,959
literally a subset of the sample space.

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,280
But that's not how I'm defining it here

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,520
because the sample space is gigantic to

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
write down. So instead, I'm really

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
defining it in words as a predicate

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,440
that's applied to the different

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,239
outcomes. So this is one event I care

60
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,879
about. And then the ultimate thing we

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:44,599
care about is we want to understand

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,599
the following probability.

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,640
We want to look at the probability that

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,200
A1 does not happen. The first student

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,120
does not get their correct P set back.

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,840
The second student does not get their

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,720
correct P set back. All the way down to

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,519
the nth student also does not get their

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,440
correct P set back.

70
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
Now we can write this a different way

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
which will be more convenient for the

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,360
way that we're going to think about

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,319
this. This is the same thing as one

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,040
minus the probability that the

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,200
complement of this event happens. And

76
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,080
what is the complement of the event that

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,040
no student gets their pet set correct is

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,319
that at least one student gets their

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,879
correct P set back. So in particular we

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,319
take the union of all of these events

81
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,200
either the first student gets the

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,760
correct P set or the second student or

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,720
the nth student. So this is really the

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,599
thing we want to compute today. So let's

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,080
think about this in some special cases

86
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,360
which I claim we can always go back to

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,360
our friend the vin diagram

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
to think about what's happening in this

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,319
space. So let's write out a simple vin

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,879
diagram just in the case where n equals

91
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:10,640
2. So I have my sample space. I have my

92
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,799
event a1. I have my event A2 and what I

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,799
care about is the probability that I

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,000
throw a dart and that it lands in the

95
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,000
union of A1 and A2, right? Which is just

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,080
this shaded region right here. And we

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,759
can just use some basic set theory to

98
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,360
write this because the probability of A1

99
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,360
union A2, well, we can break it up into

100
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
the area by each of these different

101
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,040
pieces in the diagram, right? So we can

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,479
write it out as the probability of you

103
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,520
know A1. We can add in the probability

104
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,199
of A2. Now this is not a correct

105
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,280
expression. So what's wrong with this

106
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,080
expression? Why is the probability of A1

107
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,759
union A2 not equal to the sum of their

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
probabilities?

109
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,000
>> Yes.

110
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
>> Oh, the intersection is counted twice.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,520
>> Perfect. The intersection is counted

112
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,440
twice. So here what I'm going to do is

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm going to do a trick which is I'm

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,560
just going to subtract off what I've

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,240
overounted.

116
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,960
So this is the baby version of what

117
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
inclusion exclusion is. I want to get a

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
handle on the union of these events and

119
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,160
I'm going to first overount and then I'm

120
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,320
going to correct my count. Right? All

121
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,039
right. So nothing too complicated

122
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,199
happened here. And we can try the same

123
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,560
type of strategy but maybe in the n

124
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:36,160
equals 3 case. So we can write out the

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:38,000
probability that A1 or A2 or A3 happen.

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,880
And we can do the same type of trick

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,360
where we look at the sum of the

128
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,120
probabilities. We add up the probability

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,720
of A1, the probability of A2, the

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,400
probability of A3.

131
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
But now we have the same problem which

132
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,680
is anything that happens in the

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,400
intersection of these events is

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,479
overounted. Right? So what I could try

135
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,560
and do is subtract off pair-wise

136
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,400
differences. I could look at the

137
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,120
probability I could subtract off the

138
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:12,479
probability A1 and A2 both happen. I

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:17,120
could subtract off the probability that

140
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,800
A1 and A3 both happen. And last but not

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,520
least, I'll subtract off the probability

142
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,759
that A2 and A3 happen. So this is still

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,319
not correct. There's something wrong

144
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,400
with this expression. Let's think about

145
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,120
it, you know, again, in terms of the ven

146
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,720
diagram. I can write out these three

147
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,560
sets A1, A2, and A3.

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
And if you think about what's happening

149
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,600
in the ven diagram, I've still

150
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,000
miscounted, right? So when I look at the

151
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
union of if I look at the probability of

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,720
A1 the probability of A2 the probability

153
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,160
of A3 all this region in their

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,240
intersection is overounted

155
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,479
and I'm trying to subtract off these

156
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,360
pair-wise intersections. So next I

157
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,440
subtract off this pairwise intersection

158
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,759
this pairwise intersection and this

159
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,280
pairwise intersection. But what's wrong

160
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,199
with my formula now?

161
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Any ideas?

162
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,240
So let's keep track pictorially of how

163
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,639
the algebra connects. Right? So I care

164
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,479
about the union of A1, A2, and A3. And I

165
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,039
looked at the probability of A1, that's

166
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,039
everything in this disc. I looked at the

167
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,680
probability of A2, that's everything in

168
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,360
this disc. And A3, that's everything in

169
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,280
this disc.

170
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
That definitely overcounted the region

171
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,720
in between. So what I did was I

172
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,039
subtracted off this pedal right here.

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,520
And then I subtracted off this pedal

174
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,560
right here. And then I subtracted off

175
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,039
this pedal right here. So there's a

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,199
problem. Anyone see it?

177
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah.

178
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,160
>> Yes. I've completely subtracted the

179
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,319
center. That's exactly right. So in

180
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,199
fact, what I do is I add back in the

181
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,360
center and I'll get an actual correct

182
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,680
expression. So I add in the probability

183
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,160
of A1 and A2 and A3.

184
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,759
Right? So that is a correct expression.

185
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,360
These are our two correct expressions

186
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,520
for n= 2 and n= 3. And we can just use

187
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,000
these expressions to figure out what the

188
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,800
answer is. Right? So let's go back to

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,120
our definition of what these events are.

190
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,720
So what is the probability of A1? What's

191
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,800
the probability that if I have two

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,680
students and I shuffle them randomly of

193
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,080
who gets whose P set that uh the first

194
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,839
student gets their correct P set back?

195
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,560
It's a half, right? So this is a half.

196
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,720
This is a half too. Now just to make

197
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,160
sure that everyone's awake, what's the

198
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,640
probability that A1 and A2 happen? You

199
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,279
have to be a little bit careful. Yeah,

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,399
it's not a fourth.

201
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:00,320
Uh, can anyone do you want to take a

202
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,000
shot at why it's not a fourth?

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,959
So, let's think about what this event

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,519
means. The first student gets their pet

205
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,240
set back and the second student gets

206
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,480
their P set back. So, if you think about

207
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,399
this, we could also write this in terms

208
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,519
of conditional probability the same way

209
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,279
we talked about Baze rule last time.

210
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,440
It's the same thing as the probability

211
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:26,399
of A1 times the probability of A2

212
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,480
conditioned on A1. Say once I tell you

213
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,320
that A1 has happened, which happens with

214
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,080
50/50 chance, then I now change my

215
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,480
sample space and I have to look at the

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,040
new conditional probability. So any

217
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,880
thoughts on why it's not a quarter,

218
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,519
not one.

219
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,279
Yes,

220
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,839
I heard a one half over here. So you

221
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,640
want to uh yeah perfect okay so that's

222
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,399
exactly right it's a half right because

223
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,959
if we think about these in terms of

224
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,040
their sample space right there are only

225
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,279
four possibilities in this uh there are

226
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,920
only um there are only two possibilities

227
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,760
in the sample space and once we've

228
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,160
chosen that the first student gets their

229
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,839
correct pet set back there's no choice

230
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,480
but the second student had better get

231
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,480
their correct pet set back as well. So,

232
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
one of the things that makes computing

233
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,360
this particular probability so nasty is

234
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
that if these things were independent,

235
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,680
life would be very easy. But they're

236
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
not. See, when they're independent, I

237
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,440
can multiply all of their individual

238
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,920
probabilities. And we're seeing right

239
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,959
here in this example that that's 100%

240
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,600
false, right? But it turns out that

241
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,079
it'll be morally true, at least when n

242
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,920
becomes larger. So, let's do this

243
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,079
computation right here just to make sure

244
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,320
we're on the same page. What's the

245
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,720
probability of A1? What's the

246
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,120
probability of A2? What's the

247
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,360
probability of A3? They're all a third.

248
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,360
Now, let's be careful. What's the

249
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,600
probability that A1 and A2 happen?

250
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,399
So, how large is my sample space? There

251
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,160
are six possibilities in terms of who

252
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,320
gets whose P set. And if A1 happens, the

253
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,720
first student gets their correct P set,

254
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,560
the second student gets their correct P

255
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
set, what can we say?

256
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,040
What's the probability of this?

257
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,560
>> So there's three options for the first

258
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,959
choice.

259
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,040
>> Yes.

260
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,680
>> For the second one, A2 will have two

261
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,079
choices. Yes. Multiply by 12.

262
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,079
>> Uh okay. But what's the probability

263
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,560
here?

264
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,800
>> Yeah.

265
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,120
>> Um would it just be one?

266
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,279
>> 16. Perfect. So you gave a totally

267
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
correct way to think about it. Another

268
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,440
way to think about it is that there are

269
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,959
six possibilities in the sample space.

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,040
And when A1 and A2 happen, there's only

271
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,480
one outcome that satisfies that

272
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
condition. That's where everyone gets

273
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
the correct P set because the first

274
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
student does and the second student

275
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,560
does. Third student has no choice. They

276
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,519
get it correctly, too. So all of these

277
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,760
other probabilities here are all six.

278
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,600
That's absolutely right. And that'll

279
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,480
give us that you know the total

280
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,200
probability of the event is 2/3.

281
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
Okay. So one thing to emphasize is that

282
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,000
these expressions I've written down in

283
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,160
the n equals 2 and the n equals 3 case.

284
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,560
These are valid not just in this

285
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,639
particular problem but they're true for

286
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,720
any collection of events. I've made no

287
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
assumptions whatsoever. It's just that

288
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
if I had different events they would

289
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,320
have different probabilities and I would

290
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,120
have to compute all of the terms in this

291
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,120
expression. All right. Any questions so

292
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,120
far?

293
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,880
So I think you'll agree that uh we

294
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,920
probably should stop at n equals 3 in

295
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
terms of writing down one expression and

296
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,279
reasoning about the ven diagram. These

297
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
things just get bigger and more

298
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,519
complicated. But it turns out that

299
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
there's a closed form expression without

300
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,839
looking at the vin diagram and reasoning

301
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,760
about the individual slices and pieces

302
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
of area that's going to give us the

303
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,399
right answer in general. So what I'm

304
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,279
going to do is I'm going to guess what

305
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,680
that formula is just by trying to extend

306
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,560
the pattern that I've seen for the n= 2

307
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,360
and n= 3 case. That guess will be

308
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,040
correct and we'll check you know we'll

309
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,120
use that formula to compute what the

310
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,959
answer to our challenge problem is. But

311
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,360
then we'll go back and prove that

312
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,600
formula. So that formula is not that

313
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,760
hard to prove once you know what it

314
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
ought to look like.

315
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,079
So what I claim and this is called the

316
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:35,600
inclusion exclusion formula is that the

317
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,680
probability of any union of events A1 A2

318
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
doesn't matter. It's not specific to our

319
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,880
particular problem.

320
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,880
We can write this out by over and then

321
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
under and then overounting. So we're

322
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,560
going to go through a series of

323
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,360
corrections the same way we did in the n

324
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,160
equals 2 and the n equals 3 case. Our

325
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,720
naive approximation is just going to be

326
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,519
the sum over all of the events of the

327
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,360
probability of the event. We know that

328
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,440
that's not correct in general because

329
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
we've overcounted. So what we're going

330
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,360
to do is we're going to subtract off the

331
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,519
pair-wise differences. We're going to

332
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,320
take every pair of events the same way

333
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,519
we did in the n equals 3 case and look

334
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:20,000
at the probability of any pair of the

335
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,639
events happening ai and aj.

336
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,560
The next term in the expression will fix

337
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,519
the fact that we've underounted. We'll

338
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,920
look over triples the sum over all i

339
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,240
less than j less than k of the

340
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,240
probability of their three y's

341
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,240
intersection

342
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,320
and so on. And the last term in this

343
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,120
expression is just min -1 to the n + 1

344
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,120
times the probability of all of the

345
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,120
events.

346
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,560
So that's the inclusion exclusion

347
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,079
formula. Uh it takes a little bit to

348
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,720
wrap your head around it, but it's very

349
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,199
natural. It's really just this approach

350
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,760
of successively approximating what the

351
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,839
probability of this is by over and then

352
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,160
under and then over and under counting

353
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,199
until you hone in on what the correct

354
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,600
probability is. And all of this holds in

355
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,240
general for no assumptions.

356
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,480
All right. So now it's not so obvious

357
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,519
why this is actually helpful for our

358
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,839
problem, right? Because I took a simple

359
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,800
the state problem and I wrote down this

360
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,720
behemoth of an expression right here.

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,360
But what I claim is that all of the

362
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,120
terms that are that happen in this

363
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
expression in our particular problem

364
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
turn out to be very easy to compute

365
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,720
using the intuition we developed in the

366
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,240
n equals 2 and n equals 3 case. So I'm

367
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,839
going to ask you guys for help and you

368
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,079
guys are going to help me fill in what

369
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,600
this looks like for our particular

370
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,959
problem.

371
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,160
So returning to our challenge problem,

372
00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:00,079
the one we started off with.

373
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:04,720
Well, in the general n case, what is the

374
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:07,680
probability that event AI happens?

375
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Who can help me out?

376
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,160
One over n. Perfect. One overn because I

377
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,560
can just imagine that I'm handing back

378
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,880
that students pet first and I selected

379
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,440
randomly. So, I have a one overn chance

380
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,759
of getting them their correct pet set.

381
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,920
Now we know as we go to higher

382
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,079
intersections we have to be more careful

383
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,959
right because that's where the

384
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,360
dependence between these events kicks

385
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,759
in. So that we can't just naively

386
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,440
multiply these probabilities.

387
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,480
So the probability that ai and aj happen

388
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,040
is not 1 over n^2. It's very close to

389
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,199
that. So who can help me out and tell me

390
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,000
what the answer is for this and then we

391
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,800
should see the pattern hopefully.

392
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:59,120
>> Yeah. 1 n * n.

393
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:01,199
>> Perfect. That's right. 1 / n * 1 / n -1.

394
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
That's exactly right. The way to think

395
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,959
about it is exactly in terms of the way

396
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,520
I wrote it down with the conditional

397
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,319
probabilities. If both of these events

398
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,319
happen, well, I need student I to get

399
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,319
the correct P set, student J to get the

400
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,079
correct P set. So, let's imagine the

401
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,799
thought experiment that we hand back

402
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,039
student I's P set first. they have a one

403
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,439
overn chance of getting the correct one.

404
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,600
And now when they get the correct one,

405
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,559
we only have n minus one possibilities

406
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,799
for the remaining, you know, P set. We

407
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,120
know that student J's P set is still in

408
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,440
that set because I did not get his P

409
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,520
set. And so we have a one over N minus

410
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,039
one chance of, you know, continuing. So

411
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,520
that we actually get both of their P

412
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,440
sets back. And just continuing the

413
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:49,760
pattern. So the probability that we have

414
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:55,280
a triple, you know, a i and a j and a k

415
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:59,440
is just going to be 1 / n * 1 n -1 * 1 /

416
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,400
n - 2. So now we're, you know, almost

417
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,120
home free because, you know, we can plug

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,000
in all of these these uh values that

419
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,760
we've computed into our expression. But

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,919
we're going to need a little bit of, you

421
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,799
know, counting in order to actually

422
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,799
simplify this expression because one

423
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,080
thing we need to know is okay, all of

424
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,160
these probability of AI intersect aj. We

425
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,679
know what those values are. They're 1 /

426
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,600
n * 1 n minus one. But how many of them

427
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
are there?

428
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,360
So that leads us to a very important

429
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,440
concept that we're going to talk a ton

430
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,840
about which is called a binomial

431
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:41,000
coefficient.

432
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,000
So in particular you know how many

433
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:49,600
events

434
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,520
of the following form of the form a i

435
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,280
intersect

436
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,360
aj are there right? Each one of these

437
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,559
possible pair wise intersections shows

438
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,080
up in our inclusion exclusion formula.

439
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,960
And I'm going to tell you what the

440
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,240
answer is. Uh in fact, it's such an

441
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
important quantity that it's going to

442
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,679
come up all over the place. It has a

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,280
special name. It's called the binomial

444
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,440
coefficient.

445
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,440
And it's defined as n * n minus one over

446
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,559
two. That's what we mean when we write

447
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,720
this expression of n choose 2. What this

448
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,799
expression means? So when we look at it,

449
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,960
we say this in words. n choose two is

450
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,200
because you know I have n possibilities

451
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,160
for what i is because it can be anything

452
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,160
from one to n. I have n possibilities

453
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,799
from you know for what j is because it

454
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,400
can be anything from one to n. And what

455
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm doing when I look at all of these

456
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,840
events is I'm choosing two things out of

457
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,600
them. A value for i and a value for j.

458
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,760
But the key is making sure that you

459
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,160
count this the right way because app

460
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,120
priori I have n possibilities for the

461
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,640
choice of i and then I have n minus one

462
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,720
possibilities for the choice of j

463
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
because it can't be the same as i. But

464
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,600
the key is that I have this extra factor

465
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,720
of two because I've overounted because I

466
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,120
only care about the unordered pair i j.

467
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,440
I don't care about what order they have.

468
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,440
So each pair of events for you know

469
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,280
happens two different ways both for I

470
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,160
being the first thing J being the second

471
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,360
and vice versa. All right so now we're

472
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:24,679
in good shape. Um in fact uh you know

473
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,679
more generally

474
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,400
if we look at how many terms there are

475
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,960
you know for the kway inter uh yeah for

476
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,720
the rway intersection

477
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,400
you know what we can do is we can define

478
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,000
the n choose r binomial coefficient

479
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,240
which is just defined as n * n minus one

480
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,799
all the way down to n minus r + one over

481
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,720
r factorial. And it's the same type of

482
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,679
intuition. If I'm trying to choose R

483
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,360
values out of n possibilities, I have n

484
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,520
possibilities for the first thing, n

485
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,159
minus one all the way down to n minus r

486
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,679
+ one. But I have to divide by something

487
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,799
to account for the fact that I've

488
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,200
overounted in this expression. So we'll

489
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,799
talk much more about counting actually

490
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
uh immediately after this lecture.

491
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,720
That's what we'll be starting next week.

492
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,320
But you know, let's get down to business

493
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,400
and let's actually write out what our

494
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,039
expression is. and something beautiful

495
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,080
is going to happen. So we care about

496
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:25,440
this probability in the you know the

497
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,520
union of all the ais and if we work out

498
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,480
what this expression is well I have n *

499
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,559
1 overn that just comes from adding up

500
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,240
all these probabilities of the ais there

501
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:40,159
are n of them and they're each one over

502
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:44,080
n and then I have my next term my next

503
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,640
term is minus I'll write it out as n * n

504
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,960
minus one over two so they're n choose

505
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,840
two terms There we know that their

506
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,440
probabilities are 1 / n * n minus one.

507
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,760
And let me write out just the next term

508
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:03,280
and we'll stop there. We also get n

509
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:08,240
choose 3. So n * n -1 * n -2 / 6 namely

510
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:12,400
3 factorial. And this is all times 1 / n

511
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,280
* n -1 * nus2. And this expression keeps

512
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,760
going on the same way. I get a higher,

513
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,559
you know, n choose r. I get, you know,

514
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,640
more ns here, right? And the signs are

515
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,679
alternating the same way they are in the

516
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,200
inclusion exclusion formula. And now you

517
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,600
can see I get a huge amount of

518
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,039
cancellation, right? And things simplify

519
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,120
and I'm going to get something very

520
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,559
beautiful at the end of the day. So I'm

521
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,080
going to get that this overall

522
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,000
probability which we computed through

523
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,840
inclusion exclusion is 1 minus I'll

524
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,559
write it as 1 over two factorial

525
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:54,520
suggestively plus 1 over 3 factorial

526
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,520
minus 1 over4 factorial and so on

527
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:02,159
and now magic happens. Uh so does this

528
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,159
look familiar from calculus?

529
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,159
Hopefully

530
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,120
anyone brave enough to guess what this

531
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,120
uh infinite sum is.

532
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,640
Yeah, perfect. One over e. That's

533
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,600
exactly right. It's one over e.

534
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,679
So this very simple to state question

535
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,240
it, you know, the e pops out. It's a

536
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,840
very beautiful answer. We it involves

537
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
all kinds of things that are going to

538
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,520
show up in more detail in class. So we

539
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,360
have you know this basic building block

540
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,760
and probability the inclusion exclusion

541
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,120
formula. We have the starting point of

542
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,280
counting which is going to be a whole

543
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,679
unit. And then we've connected it back

544
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,799
to um you know to infinite series. We're

545
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
going to do a lot with generating

546
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,200
functions later.

547
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,360
Um you know I think it's also good to

548
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
try and keep a mental model for what's

549
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,960
going on here because we did do a bunch

550
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,640
of calculations.

551
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,159
It turns out that there's actually a

552
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,400
very simple heruristic.

553
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,320
See in the n equals 2 and n equals 3

554
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
case remember we had the subtlety when

555
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,720
we were computing the intersections of

556
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,799
events that events were not independent

557
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,120
that's why that you know half was a half

558
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,279
and was not a quarter but it turns out

559
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,720
there's actually a simple heristic that

560
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,039
is not correct but it works

561
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
so caution here this is not a correct

562
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,880
argument but it's more of a back of the

563
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,440
envelope calculation

564
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,760
so the ais

565
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,840
I claim they're almost independ

566
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,159
dependent.

567
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,279
So they're not independent. We already

568
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,360
saw that in the n= 2 case. But what I

569
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,480
claim is that as n gets larger and

570
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,159
larger, then they do become independent.

571
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,640
You can think about this intuitively,

572
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,880
right? If I have an infinitely large

573
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,279
class, you know, the first person, if

574
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,320
they get their pet set back correctly or

575
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,960
not, it really ought to not affect very

576
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,480
much whether the second student does too

577
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,200
because I haven't really changed the

578
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,600
denominator very much. So, it turns out

579
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,400
that really the dominant terms in this

580
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,279
inclusion exclusion formula all happen

581
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,120
for smaller intersections of events

582
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,919
because these probabilities are becoming

583
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,360
astronomically tiny. So wherever the

584
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,520
action is really happening in this

585
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,080
formula, things almost act like they're

586
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,480
independent. So if you just pretend that

587
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,559
they are, then you actually do get the

588
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:30,960
right answer. So let's look at the

589
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:34,240
probability that um you know not a1 and

590
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,559
not all the way up to a n. Well, we can

591
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,039
pretend and this is not literally true

592
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,039
that this is the product of all of these

593
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,039
probabilities.

594
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,400
And you know each one of these things

595
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,279
behaves like one minus one overn because

596
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm very uh likely to not get my correct

597
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,320
P set back and I'm raising them to the

598
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,480
nth power. And this and the limit as n

599
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,640
goes to infinity really is you know one

600
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,600
over e.

601
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,840
Okay. So inclusion exclusion is actually

602
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,600
a way to make some of these intuitions

603
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
precise when you don't literally have

604
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,880
independence but you have something very

605
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,520
close to it. So, any questions? So far,

606
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,159
we've just used the inclusion exclusion

607
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,559
formula. And what I still owe you is I

608
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,039
owe you a proof of the inclusion

609
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,039
exclusion formula.

610
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,880
Everyone following? Yeah. Okay. All

611
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,799
right. So, let's prove this formula. It

612
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,880
turns out that it's really not too hard

613
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,200
to prove once you know what you're

614
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,400
trying to prove.

615
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,200
So let's take our inclusion exclusion

616
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,720
formula that we want to prove.

617
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
And there are actually tons of different

618
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,960
proofs of this fact. I'll give you a

619
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,080
particularly simple one which is we're

620
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,080
just going to prove it by induction.

621
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,840
Okay. So what do I have to do when I

622
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,840
prove it by induction?

623
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,039
um you know I have to prove the base

624
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,760
case actually we already proved the base

625
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,159
case because we already proved it

626
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,320
pictorially using the vin diagram so

627
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,799
we're good we proved it for example in

628
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,559
the n equals2 case can check it's true

629
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,159
for n equals 1 2 that's just a

630
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,840
technicality

631
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,480
but now what I want to do in the

632
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,480
inductive step

633
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,279
I'm going to assume

634
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,279
it's true

635
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,440
for some value n. And what I want to

636
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:45,440
prove

637
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:48,480
I want to show that then it must be true

638
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,600
for the next largest value. So for n +

639
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,640
one. So that'll be my strategy. And all

640
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,640
we're going to do is we're going to have

641
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,679
to write down, you know, this mess of an

642
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,320
expression and simplify.

643
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,600
So let me make my life easier. I'm just

644
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,520
going to fix my expression right here.

645
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,000
So, let's write down our um you know the

646
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,080
expression we want to show.

647
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,799
We can change all these ns to n plus

648
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,159
one. So, this is the sum from i= 1 to n

649
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,880
+ one. These are all n +1 values and so

650
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,399
on. And this now becomes you know n

651
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,559
plus2 and this becomes n plus1. So, this

652
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,159
is the formula that we want to show.

653
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,840
This is you know what the expression

654
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,600
would be at a larger value of n. And all

655
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,320
I'm going to do is I'm going to collect

656
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,159
terms in this expression so that I can

657
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,760
appeal to what I know that the

658
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,000
expression already holds for some

659
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,600
smaller value of n. And then I'm going

660
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,520
to see whatever is left over. What are

661
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,520
the terms that are left over? And I'm

662
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,039
going to have to interpret those. And

663
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,840
we're going to connect it back to the n

664
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,320
equals 2 case.

665
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,480
So let's collect terms in this

666
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,200
expression and see what's left over.

667
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,679
Okay. So first I'm going to let star

668
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,679
denote uh you know this expression right

669
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,679
here. This is you know the expression

670
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:16,240
for n + one and I'm going to group this

671
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,720
term uh you know square into different

672
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
terms. So let me start off with the

673
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,720
terms which I'm going to call triangle

674
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,520
that I'm just going to pull out my old

675
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,200
inclusion exclusion formula. So what if

676
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,919
I look at the sum from i= 1 to n of the

677
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,320
probabilities of all these ais? You can

678
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,120
see that in my expression for n + one

679
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,840
I'm just removing the probability of a

680
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,320
subn plus one. Right? I'm just removing

681
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,840
that term and I'll only keep the terms

682
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,000
that don't involve the n plus one. Okay?

683
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,600
And then I have some terms here for this

684
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,799
pairs. But my pairs only involve things

685
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:59,039
up to n. So I'm going to look at the sum

686
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:01,600
over all i less than j. But I'm going to

687
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,399
put an upper bound that the n + one term

688
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,600
does not show up in this expression.

689
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,240
And I'll have again the probability of

690
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,880
the intersection, the pair-wise

691
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,520
intersection. And I can just continue

692
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,279
this process here. So this the terms

693
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,520
that I've defined in triangle they're

694
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,320
not all the terms that are in square but

695
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,960
they're many of them right and now I

696
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,520
just want to deal with what's left over

697
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,080
so I'll define one more thing and then I

698
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,799
can at least write down an expression so

699
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,200
let's look at you know almost all the

700
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,640
terms that we've left off the table

701
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,679
let's start with the pairwise

702
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:44,240
intersections so we can look from i= 1

703
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:48,440
to n of the probability that ai happens

704
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,440
and a nation

705
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,799
right here by putting an upper bound

706
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,080
that I'm only considering things up to

707
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,240
n. I've left off a whole bunch of terms.

708
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,120
Let me look at all the pairs where i is

709
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,279
something and j is n + one. Those are

710
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,760
definitely terms I've left out. So I'm

711
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,520
going to group them together in circle.

712
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,039
And the same way I can look at you know

713
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:17,600
the next term in circle which is the sum

714
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,840
of you know i less than j all between 1

715
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,039
and n of the probability of the

716
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:28,640
three-wise intersection a i and a j and

717
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,120
a n + one. Right? All right. So this is

718
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,520
just a whole bunch of bookkeeping. And

719
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,000
let me write down the expression that I

720
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,320
claim connects all of these different

721
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,240
groupings of terms.

722
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,720
At the end of the day, what I care about

723
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,559
is this uh expression I have from

724
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,120
inclusion exclusion for n + one. That's

725
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,919
square. And I claim that this is equal

726
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,440
to all the terms that don't involve n +

727
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,840
one

728
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,679
plus the probability of a n + one.

729
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,399
That's not something that showed up in

730
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,480
my circle expression. And then uh minus

731
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,880
circle. So you can see that I've

732
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,640
actually flipped the signs here, right?

733
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Because originally when I had pair-wise

734
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,200
intersections, I had a minus sign. And

735
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,039
here I've put it as plus.

736
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,679
But it'll be clear why I did this in a

737
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,519
minute. So is everyone okay with this

738
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,240
expression? I claim that we are

739
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,559
basically home once we understand this

740
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,960
grouping of terms. So, now is a good

741
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,679
time to ask questions. Does this make

742
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,039
sense?

743
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,640
Give me a nod. Yes. Okay. All right. So,

744
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,640
let's put everything together now that

745
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,200
we've done the painful work, which is

746
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,360
writing down all these indices. And

747
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,840
let's check that everything works out.

748
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,919
So, I need one more slightly clever

749
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,600
thing. So, what I'm going to do is I'm

750
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,960
going to interpret each of these

751
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,960
expressions. So first of all, triangle I

752
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:01,120
claim is equal to the probability of a1

753
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:06,399
union a2 all the way up to a n. Not a n

754
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,519
plus one but a n. Why is that true?

755
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,880
Just to make sure we're paying

756
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,440
attention. Why is that true?

757
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,039
Because we assumed it by induction. This

758
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,960
is literally what we assume by

759
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,840
induction. Remember our strategy is to

760
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,320
assume it's true up to n. And what I did

761
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,880
was I pulled out all the terms in my n

762
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,960
plus one expression and actually we get

763
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,960
the same structure,

764
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,240
right? And so we already know this by

765
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,960
induction. Perfect. Okay. And now we

766
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,120
need to be slightly clever, which is

767
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,840
what I'm going to do is you can see that

768
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,799
all of these events show up all over the

769
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,320
place right here. These intersections

770
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,559
between ai and a n plus1. I'm going to

771
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,080
call these new events. I'm going to

772
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,799
define some helper events. BI. So BI is

773
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,679
defined as the event that AI happens and

774
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:01,200
A plus one happens. Let's check our

775
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:05,919
definition. I claim that this expression

776
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:09,359
right here is B1 intersect uh sorry B I

777
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,919
intersect BJ.

778
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,520
Why is that? Literally the definition of

779
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:19,359
BI is AI intersect A N plus1. So ai

780
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,679
intersect a n plus1 intersect aj

781
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,159
intersect a n plus1. What happens when I

782
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,399
intersect with a n plus1 twice? It's the

783
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,879
same thing as doing it once. So this is

784
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,560
literally the pair-wise intersection.

785
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,200
And now all of a sudden we're in good

786
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,320
shape, right? Because what I claim now

787
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,839
is that circle has a very nice

788
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:45,919
definition which is that circle is the

789
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:49,760
probability of B1 union B2 all the way

790
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,679
up to union B.

791
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,679
That's literally the same structure I

792
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,240
have here. This is the same inclusion

793
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,160
exclusion formula I had before. I just

794
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,880
had to squint and figure out what are

795
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,760
new events which this is expressing

796
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,280
inclusion exclusion on so that's where

797
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,240
the cleverness happened right and now I

798
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,760
can remember what these you know bis are

799
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:18,720
right so this is the same thing I claim

800
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:24,480
as the probability that a1 or a2 all the

801
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:26,240
way up to or a n happens and a n + one

802
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,320
because each one of these things just

803
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,560
takes one of the AIS and intersects it

804
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,079
with a n plus one. So this is really

805
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,240
just deorgan's laws in disguise. Right?

806
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,359
So last piece of you know I won't even

807
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,400
call this cleverness right which is I'm

808
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,000
going to call this event right here C.

809
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,560
You know the real event I care about is

810
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,839
the union of all of the AIS from one to

811
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,119
N plus one. But let me look at C as just

812
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,359
the union of from one to N. Right? and

813
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,960
let's write out what we know and then

814
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,800
we'll see that we've figured out our

815
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,400
answer.

816
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,880
So, writing out, you know, putting

817
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,839
together all of this expression, we have

818
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,160
that square. Well, we broke it up into

819
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,800
different terms. This right here, this

820
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,000
triangle is just the probability of the

821
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,119
event C. That's how we defined what C

822
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,960
was. It was just the first N events.

823
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,720
And then what do we have? We have the

824
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,320
probability

825
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:31,680
of a n + one and then we subtract off

826
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:34,320
the probability of c and a n + one.

827
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,160
Right? I'm just put everything we know

828
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,280
together. So does this make sense?

829
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,720
Why am I done?

830
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,320
Yeah. This is the base case. Perfect.

831
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:52,640
This is the n equals 2 case. So by the n

832
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:57,040
equals 2 case we know that this is you

833
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:01,040
know exactly equal to the probability of

834
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,760
c union a n + one and we just have to

835
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:08,720
remember what c is because c is the

836
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:11,839
union of all of these a1 up to a n and

837
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,079
then we tack on a n + one and we've

838
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,760
proven inclusion exclusion. So that's

839
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,520
the proof.

840
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,599
So it turns out that once you know what

841
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,440
the expression is supposed to be, the

842
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,760
rest of it is very natural because you

843
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,240
know this expression shows up in

844
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
disguise in subp parts of the expression

845
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,480
we have.

846
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,520
All right. So this was one of the

847
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,640
longest proofs we've done. Uh we good?

848
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,640
Yeah. All right.

849
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,160
In fact, I think uh yeah

850
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,320
uh one of the other proofs we're going

851
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,960
to do maybe I will be doing in three

852
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,040
four lectures time is the churnoff bound

853
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,640
which would be so complicated that we're

854
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,880
going to have you diagram it in

855
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,400
recitation. So that'll be fun but you

856
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,880
should already start to think about not

857
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,960
just verifying these things line by line

858
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,440
but why did I present it the way that I

859
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,000
did right? So I didn't literally have to

860
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,680
show you the n equals 3 case right but

861
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,760
we can see that that built up a lot of

862
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,440
intuition for what the terms are doing

863
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,400
you know why they need to alternate in

864
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,320
science and you can see some elements of

865
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,960
you know uh at least how I thought about

866
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:23,119
how to put these things together

867
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,079
okay so now um I want to tell you one

868
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,920
other brief aside

869
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,119
uh and then we'll move on to our second

870
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,720
topic for today

871
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,400
um you So there was one thing that I

872
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,160
told you about last time

873
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,000
which was when we talked about random

874
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,599
variables I talked about their

875
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,680
expectation

876
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,359
and there was one key property that I

877
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,359
told you about expectations which is you

878
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,160
you add up two random variables you know

879
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,000
f and g and then the expectation of

880
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,160
their sum is the sum of their

881
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
expectations. So this was called

882
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,920
linearity of expectation. I proved it

883
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,520
for you. The proof was you know

884
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,240
completely trivial. it was just

885
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,400
rearranging things algebraically.

886
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,280
Um, but what I claim is that it's

887
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,200
actually deeper than it sounds, right?

888
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,599
So, right now, what we went through all

889
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,320
of this work computing was the

890
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,520
probability that no student gets their

891
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,520
correct P set back, right? But you know

892
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,599
another thing I could do through random

893
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,240
variables is I could also ask you know

894
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,240
what about

895
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,880
the expected

896
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,640
number of students who get their correct

897
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,760
P set back. Right? So I had to do all of

898
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,520
this work. I had to tell you about

899
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,320
binomial coefficients prove the

900
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,000
inclusion exclusion formula to answer

901
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,160
you know a very similar sounding

902
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,760
problem. But I claim that you know I

903
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,839
have enough space left on the board

904
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,800
right here to compute what this

905
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,720
expression is right because the way that

906
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,960
we can think about the this random

907
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,800
variable the number right is really is

908
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,359
the sum of a bunch of indicator

909
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,839
variables for different events. I claim

910
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,280
that this you know random variable is

911
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,320
just the sum from i= 1 to n of this

912
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,599
indicator function of ai whether the i

913
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,240
student gets the correct P set back.

914
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,240
Now by linearity of expectation this is

915
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,839
the same thing as the sum from i= 1 to n

916
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:27,359
times the of the expectation of this

917
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,359
indicator ai. So remember from last time

918
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,839
that this indicator of an event is just

919
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,680
the simple random variable that's one

920
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,280
when the event happens and a zero

921
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,440
otherwise.

922
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,839
So what is the expectation of the

923
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,640
indicator of an event is just the

924
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,240
probability that that event happens. So

925
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,480
each of these things we already computed

926
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,640
it. It's one over n. So I'm going to get

927
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,960
the sum from i= 1 to n of one overn. And

928
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,440
that's the same thing as one. So the

929
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,960
expected number of students you that the

930
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,760
number of students you expect to get the

931
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,599
correct pet set back is one. So this is

932
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,680
something important to keep track of is

933
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,839
that it turns out that when you're

934
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,599
dealing with expectations, you don't

935
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,160
have to worry about all of this stuff

936
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,680
about the dependency between the events.

937
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,200
you know whether they're independent or

938
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
not.

939
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,599
And this is a really unique property of

940
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,079
expectations. It won't be true when we

941
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,000
get to other things like variance, but

942
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,560
they'll still be helpful expressions we

943
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,079
can do that can make our life easier for

944
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,960
computing.

945
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,280
Okay, good.

946
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,680
Let's go on to the second part of

947
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,240
today's lecture where what I want to do

948
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,119
is I want to, you know, dig a bit more

949
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,720
into random variables. We've talked

950
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,960
about the expectation of random

951
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,640
variables and what I want to do is I

952
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,560
want to introduce concepts like the

953
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,599
variance of random variables. We're

954
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,680
going to use these things extensively.

955
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,520
Um so let me start off first with um you

956
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,520
know just a bit of a reminder about some

957
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,920
of the cool things you can do with

958
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,920
random variables.

959
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,400
So last time I told you this example of

960
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,880
meanantime to failure that was you know

961
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,040
one interesting illustration of the

962
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,560
concept of expectation

963
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,920
you know if something is failing

964
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,599
independently like a computer every day

965
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,200
you know what's the expected number of

966
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,760
days uh that we expect to go before we

967
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,599
actually have to replace that part. So

968
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,200
remember just as a reminder

969
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,720
we had this concept of you know

970
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:38,720
meanantime to failure and you know if we

971
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,720
had the CPU fails

972
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,720
independently

973
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,640
with probability P each day.

974
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,359
Then one of the quantities we cared

975
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,359
about was the expectation of t which is

976
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,560
the failure time for the computer. So

977
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,400
how often do we have to uh replace it

978
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,079
and we wrote out this expression for it

979
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,560
that we simplified and we showed that

980
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,640
the answer was one over p which makes

981
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,640
sense because if I have a coin that's

982
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,599
fair you know the expected number of

983
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,079
flips until I get my first heads is two

984
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,800
and you know the smaller p is the larger

985
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,800
this expectation will be. So this was

986
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,520
just an algebraic illustration of what

987
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,160
we can do with uh the definition of

988
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,079
expectation. I want to try a harder

989
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,079
problem that builds off of meanantime to

990
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,240
failure.

991
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,720
So you know let's consider the following

992
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,680
experiment. What I'm going to do is I'm

993
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,880
going to ask you know students in a huge

994
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,880
class. Okay. I'm going to ask them their

995
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,880
birthday

996
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,119
and I want to know how many

997
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,280
until we get all 365

998
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,680
days

999
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,680
as answers.

1000
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,119
This is a leap year. So I guess we could

1001
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,440
ask a slightly different question this

1002
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,920
year. But uh we're going to assume that

1003
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,880
everyone's birthday is uniformly at

1004
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,960
random, right? And you know this is

1005
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,880
another very basic probability question.

1006
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,880
It sounds a bit like meanantime to

1007
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,720
failure, but there's a twist on it,

1008
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,560
which is we don't care about one thing

1009
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,720
happening like our first heads or the

1010
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,560
failure of a computer. We care about a

1011
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,800
coverage condition that we cover all of

1012
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,200
the different days. So a lot of times

1013
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,079
you'll hear this colloially referred to

1014
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,640
as the coupon collector problem. You

1015
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,319
know, we could ask this not with 365 as

1016
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,800
the number of things we want to cover,

1017
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,640
but some other parameter n. And you

1018
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,640
could imagine that, you know, every

1019
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,560
weekend you get a coupon in the paper

1020
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,720
and it's uniformly at random for which

1021
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,400
coupon it is. And what you'd like to

1022
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,640
know is, you know, how many papers do

1023
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,079
you have to look at until you get all of

1024
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,800
the possible coupons, right?

1025
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,800
So uh but already we have you know some

1026
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,560
powerful tools for how to address this

1027
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,319
question. That's really not a

1028
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,560
straightforward question until you see

1029
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,400
the trick.

1030
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,160
You see if you think about what I did in

1031
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,760
this example of um computing the the

1032
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,240
expected number of students who get

1033
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,200
their correct P set back. There was

1034
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,800
already something very powerful we had

1035
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,040
which was that when I have a random

1036
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,520
variable that I care about this random

1037
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,240
variable being the number of students

1038
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,960
who get the right answer. Well, what I

1039
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,880
can do is I can decompose it into

1040
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,119
simpler building blocks that are easier

1041
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,079
to understand. So that's what I did

1042
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,560
there because I broke up this random

1043
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,480
variable which is the number right into

1044
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,200
counting over all of these events just

1045
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,640
as a sum indicator variables. Here we're

1046
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,920
gonna have to do the same type of trick,

1047
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,400
but we're going to do it in a more

1048
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,520
clever way, right?

1049
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,760
So, same type of trick in action. So,

1050
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,680
we're gonna write t, which is our time

1051
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,560
where we collect all of these coupons or

1052
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:06,359
get all of these birthdays as a sum

1053
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,359
of simpler

1054
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,040
random variables.

1055
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,960
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to

1056
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:21,960
write t is t0 plus t1

1057
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,960
all the way up to t 364.

1058
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:29,520
And you know ti

1059
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,599
just to be clear is the number of steps

1060
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,680
between

1061
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,440
the i distinct

1062
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,079
day

1063
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,640
and the i plus first. So what's going on

1064
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,280
is we have a progress measure of how

1065
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,359
many distinct birthdays we've seen. It

1066
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,119
doesn't matter to me what particular

1067
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,760
days they were because everyone's

1068
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,440
birthday is uniformly at random. But I'm

1069
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,680
going to care about, you know, in this

1070
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,640
progress measure, how much time do I

1071
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,839
have in between taking a step? So, you

1072
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,760
know, at the beginning, this might

1073
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,280
happen very quickly because, you know,

1074
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
in the beginning, I've seen no

1075
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,280
birthdays. I ask a student and I'm

1076
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,680
definitely going to cover a new day I

1077
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,119
haven't seen before. But towards the end

1078
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:18,319
when I've covered all, you know, 364 out

1079
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,440
of 365 days, it's potentially going to

1080
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,440
take me a while in order to get that one

1081
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,040
remaining distinct birthday. I haven't

1082
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,880
seen to go from covering 364 to covering

1083
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,960
365.

1084
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,880
So this is a big trick, you know,

1085
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,599
otherwise it would not be at all obvious

1086
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,599
how to do this. Yes.

1087
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,640
>> Exactly. Sorry. number of steps meaning

1088
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,640
the number of students. So what this

1089
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,560
means is like let's just break down what

1090
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,880
this expression means. So I is zero

1091
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,040
here. So this would be the number of

1092
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,599
steps that I number of students I have

1093
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,880
to ask in order to get to the first

1094
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,800
distinct day and that's clearly one. But

1095
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,079
then as I go later it's the number of

1096
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,960
students I you know I just got my new

1097
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,480
birthday. I've covered I days. I ask

1098
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,720
another student. I ask another student.

1099
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,560
I ask another student. How long do I go

1100
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,520
until I get a new birthday out of that

1101
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,520
set? Any other questions? This is a big

1102
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,480
trick. It's hard to know that this is

1103
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,400
what you're supposed to do without

1104
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,000
seeing this trick before, but it's a

1105
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,720
trick we're going to use all the time.

1106
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,880
So now, um, you know, by linearity of

1107
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,800
expectation, we know that the

1108
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,720
expectation of T is the sum from ials 0

1109
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,680
to 364

1110
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:39,680
of the expectation of all of these TI's.

1111
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,640
This is literally just using linearity

1112
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,319
of expectation. We know t is the sum of

1113
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,920
all of these TI's. That's how many days

1114
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,559
I have to how many students I have to

1115
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,920
ask, right? Until I cover all of the

1116
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,800
birthdays. And what I claim is that this

1117
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,400
expectation of TI is very easy to

1118
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,920
compute,

1119
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,480
you know. So let's think about what

1120
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,079
happens with this expectation of TI.

1121
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,680
Let's draw a picture in case it's

1122
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,359
helpful.

1123
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,480
So, you know, we can think about

1124
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:16,559
all of the different birthdays. We have

1125
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,920
365 of them.

1126
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:22,480
And we've seen I different birthdays so

1127
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,520
far, right? And we're asking how long

1128
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,359
until we see the next distinct birthday.

1129
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,520
So, we've seen all of these different

1130
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,040
birthdays in this region. You know,

1131
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,880
because each dart I'm throwing is

1132
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,640
uniformly at random. I can just pretend

1133
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,400
that all the birthdays I've seen are all

1134
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,720
at the beginning. Nothing's going to

1135
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,800
change. And what I'm asking is how long

1136
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,680
when I throw a dart that randomly hits

1137
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,960
one of these segments until it actually

1138
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,440
is outside the set I've seen so far. So

1139
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,079
we know that this probability that any

1140
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:57,119
particular dart lands outside this set

1141
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:59,119
is just 365 minus I over 365.

1142
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,880
This makes intuitive sense. You know,

1143
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,559
when I equals zero and I haven't seen

1144
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,599
anything, I'm definitely going to get a

1145
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:08,400
new birthday. When I've seen all but one

1146
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,119
of the birthdays, I have a one over 365

1147
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,960
chance. And so now we're in good shape

1148
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,880
because, you know, from the meanantime

1149
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,559
to failure argument, we know exactly

1150
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,839
what this expectation of t is. It's

1151
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:24,559
equal to, you know, the sum of one over

1152
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:27,599
these pis. So in the beginning, we just

1153
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:31,680
have 365 over 365.

1154
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:35,839
Then we have 365 over 364

1155
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,319
all the way down to adding up 365 over 1

1156
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,240
which is 365.

1157
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,920
So it turns out that the answer for this

1158
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,400
you can just compute it numerically.

1159
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,640
It's about 6.47

1160
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,800
times 365.

1161
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,599
So I have to ask about you know 6 and a

1162
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,520
half times as large a class as you know

1163
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,160
I would need in principle to cover all

1164
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,760
the distinct days. In fact, you know,

1165
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,400
the same argument works even with 365

1166
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,800
replaced by n. So, more generally for

1167
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,440
the coupon collector problem, you'll get

1168
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:15,359
n / n + n / n minus one all the way down

1169
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:20,319
to adding n. That's the sum of i = 1 to

1170
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:22,720
that's n * the sum of i= 1 to n of 1 /

1171
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:26,000
n. And it turns out that this is equal

1172
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,200
to n times the nth harmonic number. It

1173
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,040
behaves like n login. So this gives you

1174
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,920
a very good back of the envelope

1175
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,319
calculation for a lot of you know

1176
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,000
randomized things that uh this coupon

1177
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:41,280
collector problem sort of shows up all

1178
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,200
the time. So basically the 6.47 just

1179
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,319
comes from you know taking the natural

1180
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,440
log of the appropriate domain size.

1181
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,880
Okay, any questions?

1182
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,960
Good.

1183
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,960
All right.

1184
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,960
So, we've done a whole bunch of examples

1185
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,720
uh today. So, we did, you know, the pet

1186
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,640
set problem. We did this coupon

1187
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,480
collector problem. These are really

1188
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,599
important examples to build your

1189
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,520
probabistic intuition. Uh I want to tell

1190
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,839
you a little bit more about some

1191
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,400
powerful general tools and then we'll

1192
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:16,240
call it a day. Um so, we're going to do

1193
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,400
a little bit more theory. The same way

1194
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,960
that last time I told you about random

1195
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,359
variables and their expectation, I want

1196
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,359
to tell tell you about the variance and

1197
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,280
you know what happens when I take the

1198
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,520
expectation of products of random

1199
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,359
variables.

1200
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,599
And in fact the first thing I'm going to

1201
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,520
do

1202
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,800
is the same way that I defined the

1203
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,480
notion of two events being independent,

1204
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,240
I'm going to tell you what it means for

1205
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,240
two random variables to be independent.

1206
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,720
and then we'll see you know when two

1207
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,880
random variables are independent what

1208
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,280
kinds of computations become easier

1209
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,280
using that.

1210
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,480
So here's our key definition that we're

1211
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,200
going to explore for the rest of what's

1212
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,760
left in lecture. So remember we have

1213
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,680
this notion of a random variable which

1214
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,960
is just a function from the outcome

1215
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:11,680
space to a real value. And now imagine I

1216
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,520
give you two random variables f and g.

1217
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,520
Well, we're going to say that they're

1218
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,520
independent

1219
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,440
if

1220
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:26,720
the following events are independent.

1221
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:30,079
So, let's look at all the x's where f

1222
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:34,000
ofx equals alpha

1223
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:38,960
and let's look at all of the x's where g

1224
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,480
of x equals some beta. All right, so a

1225
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,119
bunch of things are happening here,

1226
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,359
right? So I have a random variable which

1227
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,079
remember takes an outcome and maps it to

1228
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,160
a real value. So f and g are my two

1229
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,480
functions that map outcomes to real

1230
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,200
values. What I can do is I can use a

1231
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,119
random variable to define an event. So

1232
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,119
now I'm going the other direction.

1233
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,040
Before what I told you about was how to

1234
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,280
take an event and define a random

1235
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,720
variable. That took us to the notion of

1236
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,040
an indicator variable and we use that in

1237
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,040
that computation. Now I'm going the

1238
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,440
other direction which is I'm saying

1239
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,200
imagine I give you a random variable. It

1240
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,000
takes on a whole bunch of discrete

1241
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,040
values and what I'll do is I'll chop up

1242
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,800
the domain the sample space into the

1243
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,359
parts that correspond to different

1244
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,880
values of that random variable. So I'm

1245
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,960
going the other direction. I'm taking a

1246
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,480
random variable and defining an event

1247
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,440
because the end of the day this is just

1248
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,839
a subset of the outcome space. So this

1249
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,319
is an event that's defined based on the

1250
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,400
choice of alpha. I get a different event

1251
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,640
for different choice of alpha. This is

1252
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,680
an event that's defined based on the

1253
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,520
choice of beta and g. And what I want is

1254
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,760
that I want these two events are

1255
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,359
independent, which is just the same

1256
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,079
definition of independence we had

1257
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:56,559
before. I want the probability of the

1258
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,160
intersection of those two events to be

1259
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,480
equal to the product of their

1260
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,280
probabilities. That's literally how we

1261
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,880
defined independence of events. And what

1262
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,680
it means for random variables to be

1263
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,240
independent is this more stringent thing

1264
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,200
which is I want that for any choice of

1265
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,200
alpha and beta that induces some choice

1266
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,839
of an event one for one random variable

1267
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,240
one for the other I want every choice of

1268
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,319
alpha and beta to define two events that

1269
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,960
are independent.

1270
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,480
Does this make sense? So this is a more

1271
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,720
complicated definition that we had

1272
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,680
before because we have one quantifier

1273
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,359
here. So checking independence for you

1274
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,880
know events is very easy. You just

1275
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,280
compute a bunch of probabilities and

1276
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,200
check that the equation holds. Now

1277
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,280
computing independence for random

1278
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,119
variables is trickier because in

1279
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,280
principle you have to worry about every

1280
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,079
possible value of alpha and beta and

1281
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,000
compute all of those probabilities.

1282
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,240
Okay.

1283
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,200
Nevertheless, it's a very powerful

1284
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,599
notion. Okay.

1285
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:02,119
Uh, one thing you can do is let's just

1286
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,119
do a simple consistency check.

1287
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,599
Sorry for going back and forth and back

1288
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:12,720
and forth, but you know, we can look at

1289
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,640
the indicator

1290
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,960
of two different events A and B. Those

1291
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:20,079
are random variables. What does it mean

1292
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,079
for those functions to be independent? I

1293
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,559
claim that those functions, those random

1294
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,200
variables are independent if and only if

1295
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,920
their events are. So this just means

1296
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,119
that our definition makes sense, right?

1297
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,480
Because we're thinking of random

1298
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,720
variables as a generalization of events

1299
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,599
because I can have not just 01 values,

1300
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,240
but I can have any real values. But my

1301
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,480
definition better at least recover what

1302
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,880
my definition was in the case of events.

1303
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,960
And that's true. You can check that if

1304
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,680
you you know create two random variables

1305
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,680
based in the indicator functions of two

1306
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,599
different events that they will meet

1307
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,440
this condition if and only if the

1308
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,280
corresponding events meet that condition

1309
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,520
too because you really only have to

1310
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,960
check you know alpha and beta being zero

1311
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,520
and one and you can check that

1312
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,000
everything works out. So that's good. So

1313
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,839
we have a a reasonable notion of

1314
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,240
independence.

1315
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:16,880
Um what I want to work up today is some

1316
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,880
idea of you know why this is powerful.

1317
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,319
And I want [clears throat] to compare

1318
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,400
and contrast this the linearity of

1319
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:27,359
expectation that we've already used to

1320
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:31,119
great effect. So here's the key lema

1321
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:33,280
which we'll prove. The proof is you know

1322
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,119
pretty boring uh but it's a very

1323
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,440
powerful lema. The proof is really just

1324
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,880
about uh massaging the definitions the

1325
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,359
same way we had for linearity of

1326
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,920
expectation. What I claim is that if we

1327
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,240
have two random variables f and g, so

1328
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,799
let's say f and g are independent random

1329
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:56,079
variables. Then what I claim is that the

1330
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:58,720
expectation of f ofx times g ofx is

1331
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:01,720
equal to the product of their

1332
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,720
expectation.

1333
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,240
Okay, so that's the lema I want to prove

1334
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,640
and I promise you the proof is very easy

1335
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,240
but this is still a very powerful lema.

1336
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,880
So usually when I'm trying to learn

1337
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,720
something new uh I try and connect it

1338
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,119
back to something that I already

1339
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,200
understand.

1340
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,359
So let's think about the special case

1341
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,799
again where you know these random

1342
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,960
variables are indicators of events. This

1343
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:34,559
is an indicator of an event A. This is

1344
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,480
an indicator of an event B. Right? So

1345
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,880
you know what would the expectation of

1346
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,680
the indicator of event A look like? It

1347
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,040
would be the probability of the event A.

1348
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,440
What would the expectation of the

1349
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,280
indicator function of the other event

1350
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,200
look like? It would be the probability

1351
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,440
of the other event. So this is the

1352
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,839
product of their probabilities. What is

1353
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,640
that supposed to be equal to? What

1354
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,640
happens if I take two indicator

1355
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,400
functions of two different events A and

1356
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,960
B? What do I get? What is that? That's a

1357
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:07,920
whole bunch of English to parse. I take

1358
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,359
the indicator of two different events A

1359
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,280
and B and I multiply the indicator

1360
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,119
random variables.

1361
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,359
What is that? Can anyone describe that

1362
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,400
to me in English? Yeah.

1363
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,240
Yes. Exactly. So, uh the product of them

1364
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,240
is literally the indicator of the

1365
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,240
intersection of the events and then the

1366
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,400
expectation of that as you said is the

1367
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,559
probability that both of them happen. So

1368
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,280
this recovers something we already know

1369
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,680
right which is lit literally this is the

1370
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,920
definition of what um you know

1371
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,920
independence is for events. So this is

1372
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,799
just a generalization building a more

1373
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:47,440
general theory of what's going on. All

1374
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:49,760
right so the let's prove this thing

1375
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,319
that's tedious. Let's just write out the

1376
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,440
definitions and see what happens.

1377
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,720
So I've got the expectation of f ofx and

1378
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,960
g ofx. Well, whatever this mess is

1379
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,119
inside, that's a random variable. It

1380
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,720
takes in an outcome X and it spits out a

1381
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,440
real value that's given by the product

1382
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:10,240
of the values of f and g. So I can take

1383
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,559
its expectation just by you know

1384
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,599
literally using the definition of the

1385
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:18,400
expectation. It's the sum over all x's

1386
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:22,000
in the sample space of p of x the

1387
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,319
probability of that event times f ofx

1388
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
times g ofx. I haven't done anything

1389
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,160
here. I've just literally used the

1390
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,920
definition. Whatever this monstrosity

1391
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,599
is, it's a random variable and this is

1392
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,119
the definition of what its expectation

1393
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,119
is.

1394
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,599
And now what we're going to do is here's

1395
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,160
the one clever part is we're going to

1396
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:42,319
break up the sum into different pieces

1397
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,720
in a way that corresponds to you know

1398
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,319
clearly we have to use this definition

1399
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,119
of independence otherwise the thing is

1400
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:51,359
false. And independence is fundamentally

1401
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,680
about breaking up the sample space into

1402
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:55,920
different pieces. So I'm going to break

1403
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,839
up that sum into different pieces

1404
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,559
mimicking the way that I've broken it up

1405
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,920
in this definition. So literally the way

1406
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,160
that I'm going to do that is it's going

1407
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,880
to be the sum over alpha alpha and beta.

1408
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,240
And that should sound familiar.

1409
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:13,119
And then the sum over all x that are in

1410
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,880
the sample space but moreover where f

1411
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:19,440
ofx is equal to alpha and g ofx is equal

1412
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,119
to beta. So I'm just breaking this sum

1413
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,520
up into different pieces different

1414
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,720
contributions. And then I have the same

1415
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,280
thing, right? I have um the probability

1416
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,839
of that outcome. I have f ofx. I have g

1417
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,920
of x. Except because I've broken this

1418
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,599
event up, I know what f ofx is and I

1419
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,319
know what g of x is. They're alpha and

1420
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:43,119
beta respectively. So this is the same

1421
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:45,280
thing as alpha * beta times the

1422
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,440
probability

1423
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:51,520
of x.

1424
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,520
Okay, so now we're in good shape and

1425
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:57,319
we're just going to have to rearrange

1426
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,319
what this sum is.

1427
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:04,559
So let's massage the sum until it uh it

1428
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:08,319
stares us in the face how to appeal to

1429
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:11,520
independence. So this sum is the same

1430
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:15,520
thing as

1431
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:20,079
sum over alpha and beta

1432
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:24,319
time alpha you know of alpha* beta times

1433
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:30,319
the probability that f ofx is equal to

1434
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:32,960
alpha and g of x is equal to beta.

1435
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,359
So what have I done here? Right? This

1436
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,160
alpha and beta, I can actually just pull

1437
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,799
it outside this sum. And when I pull

1438
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:43,200
this alpha and beta outside the sum, I'm

1439
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:45,280
left with the sum, you know, of all

1440
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,839
these probabilities of these atomic

1441
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,880
outcomes. And this is really just an

1442
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:54,400
event, right? It's the event that f ofx

1443
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,960
equals alpha and g ofx equals beta. So I

1444
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,440
get the probability of that event,

1445
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,760
right? And now I can appeal to

1446
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,480
independence because this is the same

1447
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,440
thing as the sum over alpha and beta.

1448
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:10,319
Again, alpha times beta. But now I can

1449
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:14,000
break up these probabilities. f ofx=

1450
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:17,039
alpha times the probability that g ofx

1451
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,280
equals beta. That's what it means for

1452
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,039
the two events that I've defined here to

1453
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,359
be independent is literally that the

1454
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,319
probability of their intersection is the

1455
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:28,079
product of their probabilities.

1456
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:31,520
And so now I'm in good shape because

1457
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,359
what I can do is I can turn this into

1458
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,280
two different sums. The sum over alpha

1459
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:37,839
and the sum over beta. And I can pull

1460
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,599
out terms that don't depend on beta. And

1461
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,960
I claim that this is the same thing as

1462
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:47,440
the sum over alpha of alpha times the

1463
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:50,960
probability that f ofx equals alpha

1464
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:54,079
all times the sum over beta of beta

1465
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,440
times the probability that g ofx equals

1466
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,599
beta.

1467
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,680
So I really haven't done much other than

1468
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:02,400
figure out this way to break up the

1469
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:04,480
sample space so that I can appeal to my

1470
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,200
definition. But the rest of it is just

1471
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:10,440
algebra. So what is this expression

1472
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,440
right here?

1473
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,760
Any ideas? This wasn't quite my original

1474
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,319
definition, but uh hopefully you should

1475
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:20,240
see that it's the same.

1476
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,960
What property of the random variable f

1477
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,839
is that expression computing?

1478
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,599
Yeah, expectation. That's right. So my

1479
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:30,000
original definition for expectation was

1480
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,520
the sum over x's in the sample space.

1481
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,920
Here I'm doing the same thing, but I'm

1482
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,640
collecting all the x's together that

1483
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,880
have f ofx equal alpha and you know

1484
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,200
arranging it that way. So this is

1485
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:45,359
exactly just another definition for the

1486
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:50,400
expectation of f ofx. And likewise this

1487
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:55,000
right here is the expectation of g ofx.

1488
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,000
Awesome. So we're done. Any

1489
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,319
questions?

1490
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,400
Okay, let's do a diagnostic question.

1491
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,960
This is definitely the way I like to

1492
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,440
think about these things. Uh, I just

1493
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,839
proved something for you.

1494
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,599
You know, [clears throat] learning about

1495
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,640
proofbased math, especially learning

1496
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,880
about how to write it, isn't just about

1497
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,119
verifying line by line what I do on the

1498
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,480
board. It's about trying to understand

1499
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,920
why I organized my proof that way and

1500
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,000
also where I use the different

1501
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,680
assumptions. Right? So the critical

1502
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
thing here for this lema which is

1503
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,319
different than linearity of expectation.

1504
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
See linearity of expectation I used

1505
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:42,000
nothing.

1506
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,520
For this lema, I use something I use

1507
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,599
something very strong, which was that f

1508
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,039
and g are independent. And we talked

1509
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,039
about how it's a bit of a pain in the

1510
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,400
neck to actually verify independence

1511
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:54,480
because you have to check it over all

1512
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:58,559
alpha and beta. Um, did I really need

1513
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:00,960
that uh property of independence? Right?

1514
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,599
So obviously your intuition is that I

1515
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:06,599
did use it crucially. So can you think

1516
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,599
of

1517
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,000
an example

1518
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:18,640
where we have two random variables f and

1519
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,039
g but f and g are not independent

1520
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:25,880
and where this lema fails where the

1521
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,880
expectation of the product

1522
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:30,880
is not equal to the product of their

1523
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,880
expectations.

1524
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,440
So if you're able to push back, you

1525
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,359
know, all of the symbols and think about

1526
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,440
this intuitively, this would be very

1527
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:47,119
easy.

1528
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,119
But it's not always that easy.

1529
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,359
Can anyone is anyone bold enough to

1530
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:54,319
think of an example where I have, you

1531
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:56,240
know, two fing two random variables that

1532
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:58,640
violate my assumptions of the lema? They

1533
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,520
are not independent. And the conclusion

1534
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,520
of my lema is false too.

1535
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,520
Yeah.

1536
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,839
>> Yes. Perfect. Let me raise you one which

1537
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:15,039
is let's just define f to be the

1538
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:17,599
indicator function of some event A and

1539
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,319
let's let G be the indicator function of

1540
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,640
the complement of A. That would do the

1541
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:25,039
trick, right? So maybe these both have

1542
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,480
some nonzero probability of happening.

1543
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,799
The product of their probabilities is

1544
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,880
non zero. But you know what's the

1545
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,559
product of them? Well, that's the

1546
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,559
indicator function of both events

1547
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,400
happening. And no event and its

1548
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,480
complement can both happen. So we're

1549
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,640
done. So these are not independent and

1550
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,160
the statement is false. So you know,

1551
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,839
especially as we go to more and more

1552
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,920
general abstraction, it's always good to

1553
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:49,200
keep in some mental model that helps you

1554
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,960
navigate what's going on.

1555
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,880
So, we've only got a few minutes left,

1556
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:56,400
which is perfect because I want to

1557
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:58,640
introduce you to uh one last concept

1558
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,640
which is also powerful. This is the

1559
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,119
thing I've been promising you, which is

1560
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,920
the notion of variance. So, that's our

1561
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:08,240
last topic for today. And I'll tell you

1562
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,079
one basic but very powerful property of

1563
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,599
variance

1564
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,920
um that we're going to see at length in

1565
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:18,159
the SQL when we get back to probability

1566
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,319
when we talk about tail bounds and we

1567
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:22,480
can already see some of the intuition.

1568
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,880
So first let me just define what the

1569
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:29,120
variance is. It's another property of a

1570
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:32,080
random variable. So the variance

1571
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:35,839
of a random variable is the following

1572
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:37,839
quantity. We write it as var of f. It's

1573
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:43,279
the expectation

1574
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:45,679
of f ofx minus the expectation of

1575
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,159
f ofx

1576
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:50,319
squared. All right. So a bunch of things

1577
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:53,040
are happening here, right? So this

1578
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,199
whatever it is, it's a scaler, right?

1579
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,440
That's whatever the average value is for

1580
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,839
the random variable. I'm creating a new

1581
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,400
random variable that shifts the average

1582
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:04,719
down to zero. So the average of this new

1583
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,480
random variable is zero. And when I

1584
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,120
square this thing, I'm measuring how

1585
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,719
spread out it is. So the variance, as

1586
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,600
the name suggests, is how much you

1587
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,480
expect the random variable to vary. It's

1588
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,560
a very coarse grained uh you know way to

1589
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,359
define how much a random variable

1590
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,880
varies. And we'll develop a lot of finer

1591
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,799
grain tools that'll give us a better

1592
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,719
understanding what's going on. But

1593
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:29,600
already we'll be able to use this to

1594
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:32,080
great effect.

1595
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,319
Uh so that was my informal claim is that

1596
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,319
it measures

1597
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,799
how spread out

1598
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,920
a random variable is.

1599
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:52,480
Let me give you a basic fact

1600
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:55,600
which is easy to show. So first of all I

1601
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:58,320
claim that the variance of f is non-

1602
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,719
negative. That's true for any random

1603
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,440
variable.

1604
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:06,080
Can anyone argue why this is true so

1605
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,600
that I don't have to prove it?

1606
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,679
There should just be a one sentence.

1607
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,920
Yeah,

1608
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,760
>> that's right. That's right. Let's just

1609
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,480
unpack what this is. It's the

1610
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,480
expectation of a random variable. So,

1611
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,159
what we do is we take a weighted average

1612
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,640
according to the probabilities in the

1613
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:24,800
sample space of the values that this

1614
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,400
random variable takes on. But the random

1615
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,080
variable I care about is this thing

1616
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,480
that's really, you know, it's it's the

1617
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:32,080
outcome of squaring the thing. So it's

1618
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,520
always non- negative. The weighted

1619
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,320
average of a bunch of non- negative

1620
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:39,840
things had better be non- negative. In

1621
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,679
fact, um, let me raise you one. I claim

1622
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,239
that not only is that statement true,

1623
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,480
and your explanation was perfect. I

1624
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:48,960
claim that when the variance of a

1625
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,360
function is zero, there's something very

1626
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,320
strong we can say about the random

1627
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,480
variable. So what happens when the

1628
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:59,600
variance of a of a random variable is

1629
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:03,760
zero? Yes, it's constant. That's right.

1630
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:06,719
So f is constant value.

1631
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:09,520
So it doesn't matter what point you give

1632
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:11,440
me what outcome in the sample space,

1633
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,520
there's always one fixed value and it

1634
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:17,120
only takes on that value. That's exactly

1635
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:19,280
right. Now there's um one other

1636
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,560
alternative formula for the variance

1637
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,640
that's sometimes helpful. you know, uh,

1638
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,840
in some cases, one is a better starting

1639
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,560
point than the other. They're both

1640
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:30,560
equivalent, but it it pays to just keep

1641
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,880
both in mind and use whichever one is

1642
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,800
easier. So, let me give you another

1643
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,120
alternative expression for the variance.

1644
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,124
And then let me tell you a powerful

1645
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,199
property of the variance that that kicks

1646
01:11:40,124 --> 01:11:43,760
[clears throat] in when we have

1647
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:46,159
independence.

1648
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:49,159
So an alternative completely alternative

1649
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:49,159
formula

1650
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:55,360
is that the variance of f is equal to

1651
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:00,480
the expectation

1652
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:02,640
of f ofx squared minus

1653
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,679
the expectation

1654
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:09,760
of f f ofx but with the square on the

1655
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:13,960
outside. Okay. And this happens because

1656
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,960
you know from our first expression

1657
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:23,360
when we expand out the square we'll get

1658
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:27,520
that the variance of f is equal to the

1659
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:30,400
expectation of f ofx quantity squared

1660
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:33,199
minus 2 times

1661
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,800
the value of the function times the

1662
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:39,040
expectation of the function.

1663
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:44,080
uh and then plus

1664
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:46,080
the expectation of f ofx squared

1665
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:49,679
and now we can appeal to linearity of

1666
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:51,920
expectation and life becomes good. So we

1667
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,480
have the expectation of f ofx with the

1668
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,080
square on the inside. Well this part

1669
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,560
right here is not a random variable.

1670
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:01,360
That's a scalar. So it really just pulls

1671
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:04,960
outside of the expectation in a nice way

1672
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:07,360
and we get another e of f ofx. So we get

1673
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,040
minus two copies of the expectation of f

1674
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,239
ofx squared with the square on the

1675
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,400
outside. We add one more copy back in

1676
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:19,760
and in total we're just subtracting one

1677
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:21,760
copy with the square on the outside.

1678
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,280
So this just uses the you know

1679
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,760
properties of the expectation and

1680
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:29,960
linearity of expectation but this gives

1681
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,960
us our two different definitions.

1682
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,560
And now uh we can say

1683
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,640
the last property that we're going to

1684
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,679
show for today and I'll tell you why

1685
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,679
this property is so important.

1686
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:45,941
[clears throat]

1687
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,840
So I claim that if we have two functions

1688
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:58,520
f and g that are independent then the

1689
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,520
variance of their sum

1690
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,880
is equal to the sum of their variances.

1691
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:10,320
So this is definitely not true in

1692
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,159
general.

1693
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,520
This looks a bit like linearity of

1694
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,679
expectation, but it's really very

1695
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,040
different, right? Because linearity of

1696
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:23,159
expectation held always. This only holds

1697
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:23,159
when f and g are independent.

1698
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,400
So you can prove this. Let's just do a

1699
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,400
quick proof and then I'll tell you about

1700
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,600
some cool applications.

1701
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:40,239
So by definition,

1702
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:42,080
well the variance of f ofx plus g ofx,

1703
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,679
well we can write it out from our first

1704
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:48,760
definition.

1705
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,760
We add up f ofx plus g ofx.

1706
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,000
We subtract off their expectation. And

1707
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,480
then we're going to regroup terms and

1708
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:03,360
we'll see what happens. So we subtract

1709
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:05,760
off the expectation of their sum f ofx

1710
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,000
plus g ofx

1711
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,239
and we take the square of this entire

1712
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,920
thing. Right? That's literally the

1713
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:14,400
definition.

1714
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:17,280
And now what we can do is we can appeal

1715
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:19,679
to linearity

1716
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:22,880
of expectation

1717
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:25,280
and we'll get that this entire thing

1718
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:29,679
is equal to well let's group together

1719
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:33,840
terms. It'll be the expectation

1720
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:37,320
of f ofx minus the expectation

1721
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,320
of f ofx

1722
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:45,679
plus

1723
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:48,480
g ofx minus its expectation of g ofx

1724
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,320
and this entire thing is squared. So all

1725
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,480
I'm doing is remember the square is

1726
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,640
happening outside all this mess. I'm

1727
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,560
pushing the expectation through. So this

1728
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,120
is the expectation of f ofx plus the

1729
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,520
expectation of g ofx. I'm pulling one

1730
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:04,159
term, you know, with f and one term with

1731
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,719
g. But now what I can do is I can expand

1732
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:08,640
the square. And if I expand the square,

1733
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,320
I'm going to get this quantity squared.

1734
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,719
That's literally the definition of the

1735
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,560
variance of f. I'm going to get this

1736
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:18,080
quantity squared. That's the variance of

1737
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,840
g. And I'm going to get cross terms. But

1738
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:23,280
now the key thing is that that cross

1739
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:26,640
term is zero because of independence. I

1740
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:29,040
have the expectation of this times this

1741
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:31,440
because these things are independent.

1742
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,320
It's the product of their expectations

1743
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,840
and each individual thing is zero. So

1744
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,679
that's really the last part of the

1745
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,080
argument. I can write that out a bit

1746
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,080
more precisely.

1747
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,320
So the key thing is really what happens

1748
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:49,040
with the cross term. So when we get this

1749
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:56,080
cross term that looks like 2 * the

1750
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:57,600
expectation of f ofx minus e of f ofx

1751
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:03,840
times

1752
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:05,679
g ofx minus the expectation of g ofx.

1753
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,199
Then what's going to happen is by

1754
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:13,320
independence we can write this out as

1755
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:13,320
the product of their expectations.

1756
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,360
And this is all times the same thing.

1757
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,920
The expectation of g of x minus its own

1758
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,440
expectation.

1759
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,600
And now we're in good shape because

1760
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,600
literally by linearity of expectation

1761
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,199
this is zero. Right? You know it's

1762
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,800
important to not lose track of what

1763
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:35,360
these different things mean. This term

1764
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,280
right here is just the scalar shift. And

1765
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,280
what's going on is I'm just, you know,

1766
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,280
shifting so that the mean of my random

1767
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,640
variable is zero. And the fact that

1768
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,560
they're independent allows me to write

1769
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,719
it as a product. So that's exactly why I

1770
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,239
get zero. So we can put together all

1771
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,040
these pieces and we have this beautiful

1772
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:52,880
statement that the sum of the variances

1773
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,040
uh you know for two independent random

1774
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,520
variables adds when we add up the two

1775
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,640
random variables. So I'll leave you with

1776
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:04,480
a closing example uh which we're going

1777
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:06,480
to talk about in much more detail.

1778
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,400
There's a super important example from

1779
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,480
this that's you know becoming very

1780
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:13,520
relevant these days which is about

1781
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:16,960
polling. So we might have you know some

1782
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:18,640
particular uh events that we care about

1783
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:21,280
which are things like you know the

1784
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,920
probability any particular person votes

1785
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,840
one way or the other and we care about

1786
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,280
something like what the sum of those

1787
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,920
events are going to be because we want

1788
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,440
to forecast elections. So it turns out

1789
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,760
that the way that you can do this, you

1790
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,000
know, at least in principle is if you

1791
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,719
pick a random person and ask them who

1792
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,040
they're going to vote for. Well, that'll

1793
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:43,280
give you, you know, some estimate of

1794
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,679
what the underlying baseline probability

1795
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,080
is. And then you can do this not for one

1796
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:50,000
person, but for many people. So when you

1797
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,280
look at that estimator, it ends up being

1798
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,679
the sum of independent random variables.

1799
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:57,760
And the fact that that converges very

1800
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,159
quickly to the true average for the

1801
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,800
random variables as we'll see really

1802
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:05,600
comes out of this fact that the variance

1803
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,679
adds instead of increasing by a larger

1804
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,679
quantity. So we'll talk a lot more about

1805
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,199
that uh in later lectures when we talk

1806
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,960
about things called concentration

1807
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,239
bounds. But I just want to give you a

1808
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,560
hint of where we're going with these

1809
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:18,400
tools and we'll practice a bunch of you

1810
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,000
know explicit computations with variance

1811
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:24,560
to get a handle first before we go to

1812
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,560
tailbounds. Uh so we'll stop there.
