arise hey good evening everyone uh my

142
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,919
name is Scott Hungerford uh I graduated

143
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,680
from the leaders glob operations program

144
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,720
in

145
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,160
2023 uh before I went to MIT uh I

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
actually was an engineering associate

147
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,199
for the city of Los Angeles for about

148
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,240
six years uh developing large capital

149
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,199
projects uh large water projects and

150
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,880
power projects uh so I actually really

151
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,759
enjoyed that work and I probably would

152
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,840
still be there uh if I didn't go to MIT

153
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,599
and it at MIT is such an amazing

154
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,360
experience I love my my time there I

155
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:58,000
love all the the friends I made and the

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,639
times and experiences I had um after MIT

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,479
I joined Verizon and their energy

158
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,080
sustainability team essentially

159
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,000
decarbonizing our operation so reducing

160
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,080
our electricity uh bills so saving costs

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,199
on the operation side and also reducing

162
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,680
the emissions associated with the energy

163
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,120
that powers our data centers our

164
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,160
technical buildings and our admin

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,440
buildings um so I looked at different

166
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,680
opportunities during MIT and always came

167
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,039
back to energy uh and sustainability so

168
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
I wanted to do that right after school

169
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,720
and Verizon gave me that opportunity

170
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,000
happy to talk about the lgo program life

171
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,840
after Sloan and uh my decision to go to

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,960
SL during the panel thanks thanks

173
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,560
everyone it's it's really cool to be in

174
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,879
this room it's not it's not super um

175
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,599
common that you have so many people from

176
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,120
different backgrounds like this so

177
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,080
appreciate y'all all being here um I

178
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,080
guess like the first question for y'all

179
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,639
is to really understand kind of in your

180
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,800
experience from being at slow and how

181
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,639
did you guys feel that MIT fostered an

182
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,960
inclusive environment for Hispanic

183
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,759
students like what were the ways that

184
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,560
latinx students at Sloan like came

185
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,720
together and that you felt that and I'm

186
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
happy to kind of hear this from everyone

187
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
especially knowing the fact that we're

188
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,319
all kind of in different programs happy

189
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,080
to get get it kicked off uh my

190
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,520
experience was around a lot of the the

191
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,120
groups that they created in campus it

192
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,199
there's really a wide range of groups

193
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,599
that you can participate in but both the

194
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,560
Hispanic group and the Brazilian Club as

195
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,360
well um are extremely active and people

196
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,840
get together constantly people help each

197
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,800
other out and even though we are all

198
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,759
different groups I think every single

199
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,159
one of us has probably been in similar

200
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,599
if not the same classes uh at some point

201
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,760
in time at least a few of them so it's

202
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,440
also helped with study groups and so on

203
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,000
um so yeah that's my experience mostly

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,040
through the groups and the relationships

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,480
we start building there yeah know I I uh

206
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,680
Echo everything you said I think uh the

207
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,000
events a lot of the underrepresented

208
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,880
minority groups hosted I thought was a

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
really great way to just meet folks kind

210
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,680
of from similar backgrounds and actually

211
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,360
a lot of different backgrounds as well

212
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,880
um and just get together and and kind of

213
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,640
just get to know each other and

214
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,959
understand where perspectives come from

215
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,240
and just you know just get a create a

216
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,320
sense of community at Sloan um so I

217
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
really appreciated that and I always try

218
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
to attend all the events that Hispanic

219
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,680
Business Club black Student Association

220
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,440
all the other urm communities uh were

221
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,920
hosting and I always had an amazing time

222
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,600
there I'll jump in I always try to keep

223
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:29,000
it real and to be real there isn't a lot

224
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,519
of L there and there's less now with

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,839
this new lot that um was reversed as you

226
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,200
seen the the Articles and everything so

227
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,959
I think that is something that we could

228
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,120
do better um I came in a at a time where

229
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:46,839
it was just like Co and I have I came

230
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,399
and then Co happen so definitely I think

231
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,880
that um something that I did was just

232
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:56,200
like you need to push to make things

233
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,519
better and I took it upon myself to

234
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,000
really organize a lot of events and

235
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,160
everything because I want to that

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,519
community and wherever I go I go and

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,440
create that community so the Hispanic

238
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,880
Business Club uh for example I was a

239
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,160
president of that I also was very

240
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,720
involved with the black Student

241
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Association and the ab ABC which is

242
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,880
African student uh Business Club um

243
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,640
which led me to start my own nonprofit

244
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,800
which is latinx MBA so I'm the founder

245
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,440
of latinx NBA which I founded with

246
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,560
another a couple of other students

247
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,320
across different Business Schools but it

248
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,920
was again to create Community among

249
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,880
among mbas because there's so few of us

250
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,920
and at least in the United States we are

251
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,760
now up to like $3.6 trillion Which is

252
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,040
higher than the GDP of France yet we're

253
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,000
not being represented in a lot of these

254
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,160
programs not only M everyone is

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,320
struggling with this but also it's just

256
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,760
like we're not represented in the

257
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,959
brogans we're also not represented in

258
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,800
Corporate America we're not represented

259
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,880
as we get 3% eventure back funding 3% of

260
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,000
our business make it to $1 million so

261
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,079
you have to go and create this space

262
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,720
sometimes and go build it and I think

263
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,519
MIT gives you the right tools and

264
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,440
infrastructure and the resources to go

265
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,240
do that and I push you guys to do more

266
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,959
of that versus expecting that there will

267
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,720
be something that will be there created

268
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,480
there will be but also take some

269
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,000
ownership and um be able to show a

270
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,000
little bit more

271
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,560
activism yeah building on what uh

272
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,000
Jessica has just mentioned I mean

273
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
sometimes you I think you have your

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,279
tools available and then you need to

275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,440
actually like know how to use them it's

276
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,560
not that it's already given it's not

277
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,079
that okay you have some clubs you have

278
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,279
some like organization already

279
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,440
established but it's not like the way

280
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,399
where you can actually get like all the

281
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,240
all the support that sometimes you you

282
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,399
need and mainly as as a as a Latin or

283
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,120
spanic student I'm just going to tell

284
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,360
you a story about my my my partner I

285
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,320
just met her at MIT when we were

286
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,200
studying same program and uh she's from

287
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,600
Spain but we organize as Latinos just to

288
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,240
have someone who represented us uh at

289
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,079
the Senate you know there is a senate of

290
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,519
students and there are pretty much like

291
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,279
four or five people who are representing

292
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,920
uh so we try like you know try to be

293
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,480
more organized we had the the

294
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,839
possibility of have someone who were

295
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,440
like there at the same like speaking

296
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:27,120
from on our behalf uh so we just made it

297
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,360
happen we just like organize it and take

298
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,000
advantage or took advantage of all these

299
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,000
tools that we we had available just to

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,480
have like a more direct discussion with

301
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,199
uh the the faculty and and and and the

302
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,040
management and at that time also we were

303
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,920
we were studying during covid so those

304
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,959
times were were harsh I'm not going to

305
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,760
go into it but um you know it gives you

306
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,079
a sense of you you have you have someone

307
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,600
there and can can can make that your

308
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,399
voice is is heard when when it's

309
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,320
necessary

310
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,519
um thanks everyone it's it's it's it's

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,519
what you guys really took advantage of

313
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,320
um while you're here and as now

314
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,440
president of the fanic club and from

315
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,000
from Jessica's lineage um it's been it's

316
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,440
been really cool to like also kind of

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
take this on um to try to really build

318
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,320
this community at slone but agree with

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,920
Jessica that often times it it justes

320
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,320
fall on you to kind of think about that

321
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,360
and kind of a little bit of of what that

322
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,360
looks like I guess like what advice

323
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,920
would y'all give um for prospective

324
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,880
students like both like some I bet a

325
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,480
bunch of people here are applying to

326
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,959
school or have like submitted their

327
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,880
applications or kind of all different

328
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,199
places but when people who are kind of

329
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,920
on the outside looking in like what

330
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,360
advice would you give them as they're

331
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,360
applying to

332
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:52,000
school just apply let them tell you no

333
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,279
oftentimes we we say oh I'm not gonna

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,240
you know my test goore my essay like

335
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:01,440
make excuses like just do it and like

336
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,759
that's really what stopping you and when

337
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,759
I got to MIT I was just like it it

338
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,000
wasn't I mean the challenging part is

339
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,279
getting to MIT and like applying to

340
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,759
these programs and getting in and then

341
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,880
it's just like okay everything is kind

342
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,279
of downhill from there um but I would

343
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,399
say this apply let them tell you know

344
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,600
even if you're scared even if you don't

345
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,440
think you'll get in like let them tell

346
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,639
you you really never know I I Echo what

347
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,079
Jessica said I had a already accepted

348
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,000
and paid for my my like my reservation

349
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:38,639
fee at another school like my backup

350
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,920
school because I did not think I was

351
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,720
going to get in so the the feeling of

352
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,680
getting that phone call was incredible

353
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,440
and I think I Echo like Jessica's

354
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,759
feeling nothing happens if you don't

355
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,759
apply if you don't try so just go for

356
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:01,040
it especially my women we need more and

357
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,040
y'all need need

358
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,120
I think uh just coming from like I guess

359
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,920
an LGL perspective uh I know some people

360
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,720
get intimidated by like the the MIT

361
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,839
Engineering portion of it and uh I'd say

362
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,680
kind of echo everyone else said you know

363
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,600
you don't know until you you try and

364
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,440
apply um MIT is is such an amazing

365
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
campus and I think another

366
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,880
recommendation I would have is when

367
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,519
you're looking at Business Schools like

368
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,199
also look at the the campus and the

369
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,959
school attached to the business school

370
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,839
like when you go to slow you go to MIT

371
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,839
and MIT is just like another level of

372
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,040
experience and academics and there's so

373
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,519
many great things going on outside of

374
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,399
Sloan that you can experience just

375
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,240
because you you are an MIT student when

376
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,360
you come to Sloan um so that's just kind

377
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
of one my recommendation when you're

378
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,920
looking at Business Schools look at the

379
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
business school yes but also look at the

380
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,800
campus the community everything else

381
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,800
that the campus and and the school as a

382
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
as a whole can provide to

383
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,680
you going off of that same sentiment um

384
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,680
I did a very technical program

385
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,600
and I would advise don't let the idea of

386
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,480
it's too hard stop you uh cuz the people

387
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,279
who get in and succeed thought it was

388
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,880
hard so um and I know from the mbam

389
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,839
program and MIT more generally we have

390
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,240
each other's backs and we'll help each

391
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,399
other get through the material um so MIT

392
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,800
is hard but that doesn't mean that you

393
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,800
can't do

394
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:35,040
it yeah you already got the the no so

395
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,040
just go and look for the

396
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,000
yes um yeah I definitely Echo a lot of

397
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,920
the the sentiment that people said I

398
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,319
feel like um from my perspective it was

399
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,120
often um you kind of like play the game

400
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,079
like oh this person got into this school

401
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,839
and had this Gat and had this and that

402
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,480
and like it's all kind of a crapshoot

403
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,959
like a lot of it kind of goes down to

404
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,480
like who you are as a person and it's

405
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,639
just really important to like know that

406
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,240
I keep the back of your head when you're

407
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,959
kind of applying there is there is no

408
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,480
magic formula or game that you can

409
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,880
gamify throughout the entire process

410
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,000
um uh I guess like one question for

411
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,760
everyone I've seen a couple of the Q&A

412
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,039
also asked this question is like um how

413
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,880
have y'all seen what has been your

414
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:17,480
experience on how the LX community at

415
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,079
Sloan has able to like engage or empower

416
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,799
the local LX community in the Boston

417
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,079
area um what have y'all's experien has

418
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,319
been been that way maybe not in the

419
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,319
Boston area just but at Large

420
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,440
mine is going to be very targeted um and

421
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,720
much like Jessica I'll say honestly I I

422
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,640
don't know um about like Ventures from P

423
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,080
from clubs or panels that necessarily

424
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,919
were trying to do that but I will share

425
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,039
my experience which was um at Sloan we

426
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,520
got to do a class called Pro seminar in

427
00:17:54,039 --> 00:18:00,000
corporate finance in which it's

428
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:03,520
sponsored by um by companies and and one

429
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,200
of the companies it was McKenzie and a

430
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,799
lot of the reason I decided to go there

431
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,080
was because of this I met one of the

432
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,799
partners in the Boston office who was um

433
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:17,720
you know former MBA she's his um from

434
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,679
Spain her brother was in in um the NBA I

435
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,679
believe as well and her kids lived in

436
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,360
the area and through her and like her

437
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,960
network they invested heavily into the

438
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,760
development of B bilingual speaking

439
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,440
schools in the Boston area um so I think

440
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,080
it's something that derived from MIT

441
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,880
it's something that or derived from from

442
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
the network and from the school I think

443
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,960
it's something that is really important

444
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,280
for uh the local community but I'll say

445
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,440
it was in my experience at least much

446
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,000
like Jessica said it's more about the

447
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,960
individual um Endeavors and like

448
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,679
activism that people had over

449
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,679
necessarily something that I saw from a

450
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,679
club

451
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,360
I've been very involved in I don't know

452
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,240
all the community since I was in high

453
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,600
school um I think that I mean I started

454
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,480
a national nonprofit with nmba we also

455
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,400
started a scholarship at MIT Sloan that

456
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,360
helps people while they are applying to

457
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,000
school so using IV advisors which is

458
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,200
also latinx NBA scholarship uh in a way

459
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,480
but used his IV advisers as like the

460
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,440
consultant but also Within

461
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,880
the the club like um advisers and

462
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,440
mentors to help you through the

463
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,320
application process and it really came

464
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,520
from the fact that it's expensive to

465
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,200
apply to these schools from application

466
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,200
fees test prep and overall you know

467
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
although people say don't get a

468
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,080
consultant everyone else is getting

469
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,600
consultant so then it's just like ah you

470
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,200
feel like you need one too and I'm not

471
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,880
saying you need one but it's just

472
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,720
helpful and don't wouldn't you want to

473
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,240
to make sure your application was at the

474
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,880
best places possible so we started a

475
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,400
scholarship for that both at Hispanic

476
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,559
Business Club and also at latinx

477
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,480
MBA and um also within the Boston

478
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,159
Community I would help small businesses

479
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,960
in Lawrence which is largely Dominican

480
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,840
uh Community there uh I helped like a

481
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,679
business owner try to think about a

482
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,960
private Equity um a real estate fund and

483
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,919
how to raise that and this is through a

484
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,159
program that I cross-registered to HBS

485
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,559
which was like uh scaling minority

486
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,039
businesses and then from there um was uh

487
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:35,240
I actually got like 30 under 30 Boston I

488
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:37,679
was involved in uh just going to to

489
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,760
speak to like high schools uh around the

490
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,960
area and motivating them to you know go

491
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,240
to school uh so I think that there's a

492
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240
lot of things that you can do it just

493
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,880
depends on your bandwidth like you also

494
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,840
don't have can't forget that you're

495
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,919
there for school you're there to try to

496
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:57,280
like um you know get a degree try to

497
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:01,000
take as as much as possible and it also

498
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,120
it often can be taxing for um students

499
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,360
of color or students that are are trying

500
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,080
to like support these communities so I

501
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,679
would say like do as much as you can and

502
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,520
that is

503
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,559
also yours like that you enjoy like for

504
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,159
me it gives me joy and it pushes me to

505
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,640
work harder and it pushes me uh to just

506
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:23,440
be in the path that I am but I know that

507
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,039
not not it doesn't do that for everyone

508
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,960
thank thanks y'all for for sharing um

509
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,640
and I I mean I think that like outside

510
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,919
of that there's a lot of

511
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,600
like you like a lot of it you kind of

512
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,880
have to find it yourself and kind of

513
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,600
like do the things that um you have

514
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,080
energy for right um it's really

515
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,400
important as we like kind of look into

516
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,880
like what can you get involved in how

517
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,279
can you look at this um kind of Shifting

518
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,960
track and also kind of incorporating

519
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,240
some of the questions from the audience

520
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:54,159
to kind of what just y'all's MBA Sloan

521
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,760
experience was like um outside of of

522
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,279
being kind of in the Hispanic um

523
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:04,559
ecosystem that MIT has created did um

524
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:06,679
would love to hear um from y'all um how

525
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,320
would you guys describe that like MIT

526
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:12,640
has like really influenced change kind

527
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,559
of your direction um kind of who you

528
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,840
what you thought you were going to do

529
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,720
before and after slow and like while you

530
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,720
were at school like how was MIT really

531
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,279
like instrumental in doing that love to

532
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,120
hear that experience from

533
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:27,120
people okay I think first of all and the

534
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,720
the the first advice that I that I gave

535
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,720
to people when they add me okay what

536
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,520
what should I do when when I need when I

537
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,679
when I'm preparing to go to to to to

538
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,400
this loan like you need to have a plan

539
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,640
it doesn't matter if you need to change

540
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,080
the plan thousand times but just like be

541
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,799
focused because you're going to lose

542
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,200
yourself if you if you don't really know

543
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,480
what you want to get from from your

544
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,480
experience as L because I mean actually

545
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,600
you can do whatever whatever you want to

546
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,919
do you can be more involved in

547
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,360
Innovation you can be more involved in

548
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:05,440
AI which is more popular now or Finance

549
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:08,840
or Tech or um I mean you name it so the

550
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,640
thing like just be be open just to um

551
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,520
adjust the plan that you have but have

552
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,120
have at least one and just focus in two

553
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,120
things and if you need to change one of

554
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,039
those things that you you want to do

555
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:27,080
it's fine but don't don't try you know

556
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:30,000
like to do uh anything and try to be

557
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,279
Expos as as that many things that uh you

558
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,279
can I think you can do it but at some

559
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:39,279
point you are going to miss something so

560
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:42,200
just I mean like building on on on on on

561
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,720
my experience I think that I would like

562
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,039
to I like to I meanly recommend you just

563
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,320
have a plan let's just focus on what you

564
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:53,840
want to get from from your experience at

565
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:58,039
this loan be open to adjust the plan but

566
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,679
always be have something uh present that

567
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:02,840
is what I what I what I want to get from

568
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:07,320
from from from from this don't don't let

569
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:11,320
that just classes and clubs and events

570
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,720
just happen just be be mindful that your

571
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,919
time there is is limited and for some

572
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:21,159
reason the the the the clocks start like

573
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:26,200
taking a little bit faster when you uh

574
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,200
studying and doing your your program

575
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,880
there know I actually I really like what

576
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,640
Javier just mentioned um I think coming

577
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,320
on the plan is is critical like have an

578
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,200
understanding of what your time at Sloan

579
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,760
can offer you and what how how could it

580
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,080
advance in your career and professional

581
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,520
life and personal life um but also be

582
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,480
ready to Pivot extremely hard on certain

583
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,760
things because I know folks who knew

584
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,640
exactly what they were going to do after

585
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,720
Sloan and they did not do that they

586
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,159
found something that excited them even

587
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,520
more because they talked to another slon

588
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,559
or they met a a industry professional

589
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,679
during a coffee chat or something and

590
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,159
they pivoted 180 degrees and they went

591
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:06,880
somewhere else um but also understanding

592
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,679
what Javier just mentioned like your SL

593
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,279
your time at slown two years maybe less

594
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,840
if you do a different program um it's a

595
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,360
very important part of your professional

596
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,600
development is to understand like what

597
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,880
you want to do um how you or who who

598
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,640
where you want to work like what

599
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,240
industry you want to be in and the best

600
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,720
way to kind of solve that and answer

601
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,679
those questions is just to meet folks uh

602
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,440
take as much time as you can to engage

603
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,640
with different communi ities talk to

604
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
professionals alumni and different

605
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,520
Industries and just make the most out of

606
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,799
the MIT student name that you have

607
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,679
because the moment you reach out to

608
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,159
someone and say hey I'm an MIT student

609
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:41,080
I'm a Sloan student there's a high

610
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,120
likelihood you're going to get a

611
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,120
response take advantage of that and

612
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,520
learn as much as you can those two years

613
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,640
and figure out what you want to do after

614
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,120
but be ready to to make a hard pivot

615
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,840
because you're going to learn so much at

616
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,760
at MIT and Sloan that you're going to be

617
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,760
interested in a lot of different things

618
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,799
um I just I mean even today I don't know

619
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,240
you do whatever you want to do with your

620
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,720
time there like even right now there you

621
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,880
know people are like oh you should look

622
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,559
for a full-time job like that's at least

623
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,679
for me one of the worst advice you can

624
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,600
give an entrepreneur so it's just like

625
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,600
you know it's just you go get you know

626
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,799
the degree I think another thing is like

627
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,679
the name does carry uh some brand so

628
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,760
it's just like people I'm like I'm in

629
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,240
Tijuana looking for clients here like

630
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,919
manufacturing clients I don't know

631
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,200
anything about it but I'll figure it out

632
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,559
because have contacts like Scott who did

633
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,600
the lgo program I'll reach out to you

634
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,760
and be like hey who do I connect how do

635
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,480
I know how to figure this out it's about

636
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,880
figuring it out and like you figured

637
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,399
everything else in your life out you can

638
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,919
also figure this out I was very much

639
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:49,480
focused well in school in the transition

640
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:52,440
between uh just like institutional um

641
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,000
banking to like now more of a venture

642
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,000
capital route so I had exposure to that

643
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,399
I realized that and I I was always

644
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,159
hustling because um I come from a Lo

645
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:04,000
family I couldn't really um afford a lot

646
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,480
of these trips that my classmates did so

647
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
like I was always I always had a

648
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,880
full-time job not full-time but like a

649
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,440
side household like part-time job and um

650
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,760
so you know that exposed me to the world

651
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:22,360
Adventure which uh I realized I didn't

652
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,960
necessarily want to go into um and I

653
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,640
wanted to build my company instead

654
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,799
because as I was helping people raise

655
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,360
money I saw that a lot of people um that

656
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,480
I was raising money from didn't make it

657
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,880
up in corporate and this is my own view

658
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,799
right Jessica you it's like and I wanted

659
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,559
to be in in the other camps and other

660
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,640
campus entrepreneurship and I was like

661
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,159
you know what I'm G regret not doing

662
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,120
this now so let me go see what could

663
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,960
happen and um if it works out great if

664
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,960
not like at least I didn't live with

665
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,080
regret so it's just you know I would

666
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,320
have loved to be very focused and like

667
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,480
had the startup that I had now and have

668
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,200
worked on it when I was uh in school but

669
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,880
I didn't what I knew was like I wanted

670
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,799
to be in VC I was able to make the

671
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,880
transition now I'm I'm more on the

672
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,880
entrepreneurship side uh and leveraging

673
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,519
still some of those resources and like

674
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,080
some of the network and everything to

675
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,840
just make it happen amazing um I know we

676
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,200
talked kind of a bit about um like the

677
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,519
things around so recruiting career

678
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,080
Pathways Etc like love to kind of like

679
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,880
focus it a little more like in the

680
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,039
classroom like we love to hear from from

681
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,039
Young all kind of what was y'all's

682
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,600
favorite class at slim like your most

683
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,880
impactful class the one that you're kind

684
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,360
of like taking with you were thinking

685
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,840
about um little to he what y'all

686
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,880
think I think uh sorry Jessica you want

687
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,279
to go

688
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,279
ahead yeah you can go all right I think

689
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:53,679
for me and this is going to be a bailout

690
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:58,159
but I have three for different reasons

691
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,880
So Pro seminar uh for me was a lot of

692
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,440
the reason that I ended up in Consulting

693
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,279
and where I am where I am um it was my

694
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,840
first taste at you know the work that I

695
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,760
do now and like why I decided a career

696
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,039
that I did decide on so I'd say that for

697
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:18,039
for that reason um my second favorite

698
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:22,320
class was p and

699
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:25,760
VC and because it was given by anet

700
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,320
skolar she like for a variety of reasons

701
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,440
for my prior career she's really the

702
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,559
main reason why I came to Sloan um she

703
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,679
was someone I looked up to someone that

704
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,120
I read articles like academic articles

705
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,720
uh from and all of that um so I was

706
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,880
really excited to get into her class and

707
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,559
something I pursue it actively and I

708
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,880
think the third one was Advanced uh

709
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:50,440
Corporate Finance as you guys can tell

710
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,640
like I'm really into it um and that one

711
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,080
was just some one that surprised me and

712
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,039
how you know the depth that we went I

713
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,880
thought these were things that I would

714
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,840
have seen before

715
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,600
um and in a way it is like if you go to

716
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,320
business school the general concepts are

717
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,360
always the same but the level of depth

718
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,039
and Nuance that this class went was a

719
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,640
lot deeper than I thought it would be um

720
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,240
so it was one that I really really

721
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,600
enjoyed and I built great relationship

722
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,760
with the professors as well uh you know

723
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,200
or friends up to this day I help with

724
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,799
courses and that kind of thing because I

725
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,320
just love going back to Sloan as much as

726
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,519
I can so those three um mine was um

727
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,440
corporate boards and just like the

728
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,799
amount of exposure to to people um and

729
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,080
the the people that come and speak about

730
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,159
kind of like their path to boards but

731
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,399
also like I think it was also sea site

732
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:42,799
so like and to the Sea suite and that's

733
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,919
something that's very interesting to me

734
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,480
and um I loved kind of apprach that I

735
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,600
wish it was a person but I we were on

736
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,320
Zoom uh but I think that that's an

737
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,240
amazing thought that everyone should

738
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,159
take advantage of the one that I have

739
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,799
nightmares about is DMD um I think it's

740
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,279
really helpful and everything that data

741
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,519
management decision but you know I don't

742
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,080
think it was my favorite class and I

743
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,200
don't know but I'm glad I took it but I

744
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,919
don't know I would say my favorite class

745
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:18,159
was Hands-On deep learning um it was in

746
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:20,440
Sloan and it took some of the Cutting

747
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,720
Edge Technologies like Ai and large

748
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,200
language models and the professor um

749
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,600
Professor ramach Krishnan was the one I

750
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,000
took it with uh took the material and

751
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,039
explained expained it in a way that was

752
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,760
accessible to not only mban students but

753
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:37,440
to mba's students and people all over

754
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,559
Sloan um and it was a very enjoyable

755
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,559
class I think a lot of people would also

756
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:45,559
agree who took it um would say that it

757
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,559
was a really great

758
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,919
class uh I I really liked uh the class

759
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,480
called Energy Ventures uh it's

760
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,240
essentially like developing a startup in

761
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,639
the energy sustainability world and you

762
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,000
work work with the team and uh there's a

763
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,639
handful of students that already come in

764
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,360
the class with with ideas because

765
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,720
they're like phds or Advanced degree

766
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,039
students at MIT and Harvard um and so

767
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,480
they come up with a really cool idea and

768
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,600
and then you join their team to help

769
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,000
with their business development um help

770
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,919
with their Market attack Pro like uh

771
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,320
program and like just understand how to

772
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,679
develop a business plan and Pitch to to

773
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,480
venture capitalist and I thought that

774
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,360
was super cool because I came from

775
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,880
utility and that world was just

776
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,399
different than what I ever came from so

777
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,200
I thought that was interesting and I

778
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,440
like intro to operations um just because

779
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,080
it's it kind of showed you how companies

780
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,519
work like operations is the heart of

781
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,679
like how a company operates and I

782
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,120
thought that was really interesting to

783
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,679
kind of get involved in different

784
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,159
Industries like

785
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,519
manufacturing um you know other industry

786
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,120
that I didn't come I didn't have a

787
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,639
background in and just understand how

788
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,399
they actually do the day-to-day

789
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:52,760
activities um and I thought was really

790
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:57,399
cool and I think Sean Williams was was

791
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,399
an amazing Professor uh for inops

792
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,919
well for me mean my favorite class was

793
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,159
economics for strategic decisions with

794
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,159
Bob Pik Robert Pik I think this guy

795
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,320
needs to be awarded with a Nobel priz at

796
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,039
some point in the next years think is

797
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,519
that is one of the best strategy courses

798
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,519
in in

799
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:23,039
in in his loan and um that that was the

800
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,840
I think the main reason was because when

801
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,279
I was doing my undergrad like 20 years

802
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,159
ago most of the microeconomics books

803
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,399
were written by Bob pinik so you know it

804
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,880
was the dream that when you go to MIT

805
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,440
you actually you are meeting those guys

806
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,279
to I mean at some point you thought that

807
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,279
they were just like living just in a

808
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:44,480
dream and just just realize that they're

809
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,919
like I mean normal people but super

810
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,480
super smart so Bob p is one of the I

811
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,399
mean one of the best professors uh that

812
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,159
I had opportunity to to to to meet when

813
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:57,480
I was at his loan and also that class

814
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,279
was at Harbor you know that you can you

815
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,600
have the opportunity to take some cses

816
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,320
at harbard I was very focused on

817
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,119
strategy so I I Tred to like take as

818
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,280
much most strategy courses in at the m

819
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,440
harb and harbard as I could I took this

820
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,280
one called

821
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,200
um executing a strategy I think like is

822
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,639
also one of the I mean more more most

823
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,159
relevant strategy courses focus on how

824
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,079
you execute the the the strategy of a

825
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:33,280
company and how you actually like to it

826
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,079
in real life I think you have the

827
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,480
opportunity to study with dunan or with

828
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,040
I mean many many strategy professors

829
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,200
about the theory uh but there are some

830
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,079
other courses that help you to

831
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,079
understand how you put it in

832
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,879
practice amazing thank thanks you I I

833
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,839
mean I think the the cool part right is

834
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:58,079
that you can take like classes at MIT

835
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,160
classes at Harvard classes at um uh in

836
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,400
the engineering department like it's

837
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,720
just like so many places that you can

838
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,760
take and take advantage of kind of like

839
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,160
what's out there so I like definitely

840
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,839
recommend kind of Y checking out um and

841
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,760
also just like class where you work with

842
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,680
real companies

843
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,160
um um we're coming up time soon but kind

844
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,640
of one last question for the group I

845
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,160
think that like a lot of the people kind

846
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,320
of on the call here are both from the US

847
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,000
and outside the US right like people who

848
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,560
kind of aren't um necessarily born and

849
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,240
raised here um what was it like kind of

850
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,359
both creating a network um an experience

851
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,119
outside of the US within latinx

852
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:38,280
communities or outside of latinx

853
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,119
communities um and maybe potentially

854
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,320
working even with um countries outside

855
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:42,320
of the

856
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,760
US I'm in Mexico right now so that's

857
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,520
something that's like really much I've

858
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,319
been working on both sides I think at

859
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,480
MIT um I could have done a better job in

860
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,160
engaging better with the international

861
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,119
Latinos um

862
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,440
um but I think

863
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,960
that

864
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:11,359
um yeah I could have yeah I I don't know

865
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Co was like weird um but I think that

866
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,319
you know it's it's about the network in

867
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,640
terms of are you reallying to reach out

868
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:20,040
and everything I'm part of like

869
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,160
Theo MIT network uh and it's just like

870
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,160
reaching out to people and trying to tap

871
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,280
into these different communities um I at

872
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,319
the end of the day is like what are you

873
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,560
working on like what is it that really

874
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,520
like interested in doing so um it's also

875
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,599
like building your own network and be

876
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,359
being able to like you know figure out

877
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,520
what that ecosystem to people going to

878
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:43,319
look like I think for me uh it's been a

879
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,319
great experience not not just in the US

880
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:49,359
in the US my network you know got was

881
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:52,000
Pro it's definitely the largest but um

882
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,560
at least my program there was a lot of

883
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,599
um both European and Asian students so

884
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,160
that did go back to their home countries

885
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,720
afterwards so it was very interesting to

886
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,480
see a lot of my friends go back and

887
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,640
develop these really interesting

888
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,359
business careers um in other countries I

889
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,040
know um that there was also a lot of MIT

890
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,760
alumni in Brazil um so when I go back

891
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,079
occasionally in s Paulo there is a

892
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,040
community there so it's really great to

893
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,839
like to connect and meet a lot of these

894
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,960
alumni um so i' say the school has been

895
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,920
great and fostering you know people that

896
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,680
go to Sloan I feel like usually are very

897
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,040
proud of it and do want to connect with

898
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,520
other sles and have the community built

899
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,079
out so I think that's definitely

900
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,160
something I've felt

901
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,599
throughout amazing thank you all and

902
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,920
like I mean speaking for myself like I

903
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,800
did a a class um with the action

904
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,440
learning office uh where I was work

905
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,599
helping um company in Jakarta Indonesia

906
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,560
um with their AI strategy and was like

907
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,079
able to connect with alumni while I was

908
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,280
