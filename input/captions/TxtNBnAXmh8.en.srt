1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,160
And finally, our last speaker is Brian

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
Erl, who is a senior vice president at

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,600
Salis O'Brien and their director of

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,240
geothermal operations, and he'll be

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,240
joining us virtually.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,640
>> Yeah, good morning everybody. Uh, sorry

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,800
I can't be there. Um, I'm actually going

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,840
to be in Boston all next week for more

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,480
geothermal and thermal energy network uh

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,239
uh conferences and and symposiums and uh

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,879
looking forward to that next week. But

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,559
um uh let's see is that in screen?

13
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,440
Sorry.

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
There we go. Okay. Um yeah, thanks for

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,200
having me. So I'm going to talk a little

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,199
bit about uh the introduction to

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,480
designing geothermal energy networks or

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,000
thermal energy networks. Um I know

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,359
Nicholas and thank you for that uh

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
mentioned something about a case study.

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
I think maybe the agenda might have

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,199
gotten changed a little bit but um so

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
we're going to talk a little bit briefly

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,520
about uh you know kind of the highlevel

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
technical aspects of design

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,360
considerations for thermal energy

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,640
networks and and geothermal energy

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,200
networks. So primarily these are the six

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,159
kind of uh um most important topics or

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,479
design considerations that in my mind

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,080
when looking at these systems that you

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,880
have to really consider think very you

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,880
know thoroughly through and understand

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,000
uh as you move forward in the design. So

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,520
number one site selection uh obviously

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
extremely important. Now I'm going to

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,079
talk specifically about the technical

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,680
aspects of this uh of the design.

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,320
Obviously with site selection there's

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,079
all kinds of other ramifications and and

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,360
you know aspects of why you might choose

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,520
a site uh over certain technical aspects

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,520
but just from a technical perspective

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,799
we'll go through that. We'll talk a

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
little bit about thermal resources but

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
obviously you've been hearing all about

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,759
that and and so I'm not going to spend a

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
lot of time there. Uh we'll also just

49
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,880
dive into a little bit about the

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,879
differences between a single pipe

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
ambient loops versus two-pipe ambient

52
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,280
loops and then what's an energy transfer

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,160
station, why or why may you may or may

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,959
not uh incorporate that into a design,

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,160
what impacts that may have. Uh and then

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
some of the infrastructure

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,400
ramifications, pump houses primarily,

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
because we're pumping fluid, we've got

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,200
to have a lot of these types of uh uh

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,760
systems throughout the network. And so

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,000
where do they get located? Um and that's

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,680
always a really big uh topic and

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,400
discussion with the client and the

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,000
community about you know uh where do

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,720
where do these go? How do you locate

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,800
them and uh what they might look like?

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
uh then also talk just briefly about

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,239
modeling these systems because it's ex

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,160
you know these are relatively new from

70
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,120
um the modeling community and so to try

71
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,879
to dynamically model the impacts and the

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
optimization of these systems I think is

73
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,640
really important and then of course

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,959
gathering data on existing systems so we

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,440
can continue to refine the modeling is

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
also you know extremely important which

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,920
we know HEAT is doing a fantastic job

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
with uh with their leg up program and

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,120
And uh you know thinking about future

80
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,640
expansion, we've got a lot of pilot

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
projects going on in the country right

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,200
now, but we need to think about and have

83
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,760
as part of the design consideration, how

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
do we expand these systems and what that

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,120
might look like and make sure that we're

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
incorporating proper um fundamentals

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,040
within the system to be able to to to

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,879
accommodate that expansion in the

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,879
future.

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,720
So first of all, site selection. Just

91
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,879
looking at this from a technical

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,640
perspective again, first thing we always

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,239
look for when we're looking at sites is

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
are there thermal assets that are

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,879
available and accessible within that

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,599
site. And what I mean by accessible is,

97
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,959
you know, through both regulation and

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,720
land uh uh agreements or access, can you

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
can you make that thermal asset

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,959
available to the system? So that's

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
really important. So it might be

102
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
vertical bore holes, but where do those

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,239
go? Are they on somebody's private

104
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
property? Are they within the street?

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
Um, are they in a parking lot? You know,

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
what does that look like? Is it is there

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,879
a river or a or a surface body of water

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,600
nearby? Uh, you know, any of those

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,359
things that are going to be utilized,

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
are they accessible and available? And

111
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,919
then how do you get to those uh sites

112
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,759
and incorporate that into your into your

113
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
system? The next thing would be the

114
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
building stock. You know, number one, we

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,080
always want to look for a diverse load

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,400
profile within the building stock that's

117
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
going to be uh connected to the system.

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,320
The reason for that is really just to

119
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,479
try to reduce capital costs and peak

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,840
loads and try to share energy. If we're

121
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,919
not sharing energy during peak times, we

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,320
still have to size the total for the for

123
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,320
the for the sum of the peaks, right? So

124
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,080
we don't get a real benefit from the

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,240
diverse loads on the on the peak sizing

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,240
which then doesn't offset any capital

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,320
expenditures. So what we're really

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,479
looking for is commercial buildings that

129
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,160
have in in heating dominant climate

130
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
zones have cooling dominant load

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
profiles so we can share that energy

132
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,800
with then some residential buildings on

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
that same network. That's really

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,080
important. as you were going south in,

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,840
you know, uh, in into cooling dominant

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,720
climate zones, then you would look for

137
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,440
things like domestic hot water and

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,160
things that are using, uh, uh, heat

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
versus, um, getting rid of heat. So, it

140
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,919
depends on, of course, where this is

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
being done. Uh, number one, most of the

142
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
systems we're seeing today are in

143
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,039
heating dominant climate zones. So,

144
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
we're looking for that commercial

145
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,520
offtaker that can give heat to the

146
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,120
system. And, uh, and then also the

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,880
building density. You know, we don't

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
want to run miles of pipe and only

149
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,240
connect a few buildings. We want to make

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
sure that our building density is such

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,400
that we have enough connected customers

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
to reduce that overall cost of the

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,160
network. And and it makes sense to do

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,199
that. Um and then of course the site has

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,639
to have uh areas for infrastructure.

156
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,800
Where does the infrastructure go? Where

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,600
do these pump houses or vaults go? Where

158
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,160
do where do we put the thermal assets in

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,240
in and how we connect those systems?

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
Because with these systems, you're going

161
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,080
to have infrastructure that has to be

162
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,720
placed somewhere both electrically uh

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,000
hydraulically. Um so are they within

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,680
buildings? Are they out uh um you know

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
uh freestanding buildings? Are they

166
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,080
built into maybe new developments? Uh

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,960
you know, where do those things um uh

168
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,800
you know, where are they going to be

169
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,039
located? And that's really important

170
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
because as these get built out, I think

171
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
the last thing a lot of communities want

172
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
to see is all kinds of just uh

173
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
infrastructure that has to do with

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
operating the system throughout their

175
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,240
neighborhoods. So that's certainly uh

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,600
technically we have to understand that

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,520
and figure out where we're going to put

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
it. And then of course the building age

179
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,720
and the community that you're looking

180
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,960
at, you know, what is the age of the

181
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,720
buildings? Typically the older buildings

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,639
are going to be harder to heat because

183
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,000
of the envelopes. They need to be

184
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,680
improved. They don't have as good of

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,919
insulation. uh you know windows etc. And

186
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
then also the HVAC systems are probably

187
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,080
such that they're not easily

188
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,720
retrofitable to a geothermal heat pump

189
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,120
system. So the deeper the retrofits of

190
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,479
course the higher the cost. So those are

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,479
all things when it comes to the

192
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,720
technical site selection that we take

193
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,960
into account when looking at that and

194
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,680
helping our clients really pick the best

195
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,919
sites for these projects moving forward.

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Thermal assets or thermal resources. We,

197
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,599
you know, uh, Nick did a really good job

198
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,960
talking about this. Um, you know,

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,120
obviously we've got all kinds of

200
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,479
different earth energy type systems

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,039
where you're talking about vertical

202
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,680
closed loop, surface water, uh, openloop

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,520
reinjection, energy piles. Uh, there's

204
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
all kinds of really good geothermal

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,280
resources, but there's also that waste

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
heat, the waste heat that's around all

207
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,800
of our communities that we can try to

208
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
take advantage of. And so those are the

209
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,759
thermal assets that we've always try to

210
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
analyze, look at and figure out is it

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
available, is it accessible and then

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,520
what's the cost implication to that

213
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,520
thermal asset

214
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,720
single pipe versus two pipe uh ambient

215
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,400
temperature loop. So the connect the

216
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,039
interconnecting pipe that runs around

217
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,479
the community or the network and how to

218
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,840
connect these buildings is really

219
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,479
important. Number one, uh technically to

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,319
to put stuff in existing streets, to put

221
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,440
new infrastructure in existing streets,

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,039
you have to coordinate with all the

223
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
other utilities and and a lot of these

224
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,199
older neighborhoods and communities have

225
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,039
a lot of utilities in the streets. So

226
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
having a two-pipe system versus a one

227
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,879
pipe system makes that a bit more

228
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,200
challenging and a bit more cost costly

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,959
to install. Uh the other nice thing

230
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,640
about the single pipe versus the two

231
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,240
pipe is it's much more flexible for

232
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,479
expansion for distributed resources and

233
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,200
distributed uh uh assets. So you can

234
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,399
have multitude of of thermal assets and

235
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,880
you can place those in different

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,800
locations where with a two pipe it's a

237
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,279
lot harder hydraulically to interconnect

238
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,160
all of those systems and it also becomes

239
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,399
a little bit more challenging. Um and

240
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,519
then and just the building connections.

241
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,160
Now uh the downside to a single pipe is

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,399
if you only had one thermal resource to

243
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,560
draw from then you have to size and pump

244
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,160
the single pipe such that all the

245
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,720
customers are still getting roughly the

246
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,120
same temperature uh to those heat pumps.

247
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,399
Usually we try to you know maintain less

248
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,800
than a 5°ree delta t Fahrenheit between

249
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
all of those buildings because that way

250
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,760
everybody's getting the same efficiency.

251
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,560
If you start to allow 7 8 10° between

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,959
buildings, now you're impacting, you

253
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,640
know, the person uh that's first off of

254
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,040
the line versus the last off of the

255
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
line, you know, uh differently. And

256
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
that's not necessarily equitable and

257
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,440
fair to to those customers. So, um

258
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
that's one reason why when you're

259
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,959
looking at a single pipe ambient system,

260
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,640
distributed thermal resources are key to

261
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,720
those uh designs. Whereas a two-pipe

262
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,720
system, you know, everybody's getting

263
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
the same temperature. You can locate one

264
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,839
larger uh thermal asset and everybody

265
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
gets the same temperature. So, it's a

266
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,720
little bit easier to manage uh with a

267
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,480
two-pipe system.

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,839
I'll also say that the single pipe

269
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,600
systems generally on average have lower

270
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,519
flows through that single pipe through

271
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,399
the ambient loop, which means smaller

272
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,040
pipe, smaller pumps, less energy to

273
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,959
operate. So those are also some benefits

274
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,440
of the singlepipe system versus the

275
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,360
two-pipe system. The other thing that

276
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,560
just touch on briefly is the energy

277
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,320
transfer station or or basically uh in

278
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,040
layman terms would be just a hydraulic

279
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,680
isolation between the building fluid and

280
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,640
piping system and the infrastructure uh

281
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,920
fluid and piping system. The reason why

282
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,680
you do that is uh especially for larger

283
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,880
buildings is if you have a lot of piping

284
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,480
in your building, you have a lot of

285
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,760
fluid, a lot of connections, a lot of

286
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,880
joints, you have a larger risk for

287
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,519
potential leaks and and breakage that

288
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,920
would impact the entire infrastructure.

289
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,680
So, a heat exchanger to isolate the

290
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,760
building from the infrastructure then

291
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,399
allows you know every building to have

292
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,720
its own system. uh the infrastructure is

293
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,560
completely isolated and that way the

294
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
fluids don't mix, the pressures don't

295
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
mix. If I had a mid-rise or a high-rise

296
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,640
building on one of these systems, that

297
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
pressure would would impact the

298
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,920
infrastructure pressure if I didn't

299
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,240
isolate that. So, most systems we see

300
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,079
today have what we call an ETS or an

301
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,720
energy transfer station to isolate those

302
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,720
systems. Keep in mind every one of those

303
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,240
heat exchangers though do reduce the

304
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,160
temperatures

305
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,800
uh and efficiency of the system because

306
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,600
we're not getting a a straight through

307
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,000
zero degree approach from infrastructure

308
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,720
temperature to building temperature. You

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,480
generally lose a couple of degrees which

310
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,079
then again you know can negatively

311
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
impact the heat pump performance

312
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,680
slightly. Not a huge deal but it does

313
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,240
there is an impact there. Uh if you had

314
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,320
all residential homes and all just one

315
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,720
heat pump per home, maybe an energy

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,360
transfer station isn't necessary. Uh

317
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
there's a great case study uh the one in

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,240
in in Markham, Ontario, where all 300

319
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
homes do not have an energy transfer

320
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
station because there's very limited

321
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,040
piping. There's no pressure implications

322
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,680
of additional building height. It's all

323
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,600
single family. So again, project

324
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,200
specific, but just understand what the

325
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,440
differences are and why you might use

326
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,680
that uh versus when you maybe wouldn't

327
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,120
use it.

328
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,120
And then let's talk a little bit about

329
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,760
these pump houses and and infrastructure

330
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,440
and where do we put those? Uh you know,

331
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,200
the above grade pump houses uh obviously

332
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
need to have architectural designs to

333
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
meet any city standards and neighborhood

334
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,399
standards from an from an architectural

335
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,760
perspective. Um, you obviously have to

336
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,160
have uh uh in certain cases have to have

337
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,399
conditioned space. Uh when you get over

338
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,240
certain square footages, we've uh in

339
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,720
certain areas the code would require

340
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,720
potentially a bathroom to be installed.

341
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,959
So, you know, designing above grade

342
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,440
structures, number one, there's a lot

343
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,600
larger cost implications. It's something

344
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,240
that people are going to see. So, where

345
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,399
do you put that? What does it look like?

346
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,880
um you know, great for educational

347
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,959
purposes, but other than that, you know,

348
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,279
it's really just there to operate the

349
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,680
system. Uh are you going to have, you

350
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,440
know, actual hardware installed there to

351
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,440
operate the system, or is everything

352
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,920
remote, you know? So, what goes into

353
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,760
this pump house? How big is it? Uh some

354
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,880
of these that we've seen on some of

355
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,480
these pilot projects are 20x 40 foot

356
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,399
long. So, a relatively large pump house

357
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
uh that needs quite a bit of space and

358
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,680
obviously can be, you know, can be seen.

359
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,519
So, so you know, when you're into the

360
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
beginning concepts, where do you put

361
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,600
these? What do they look like? What are

362
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,240
the sizes? Uh what are the implications

363
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,920
of having above grade structures? And

364
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,160
you know, you might have one, you may

365
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,600
have more than one depending on how many

366
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
different pump stations you might have

367
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,079
in a system. So, those are things that

368
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,600
need to be considered.

369
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,680
The other thing you could consider is

370
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,440
what if we do this below grade? Okay, so

371
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,839
now we don't have to look at anything.

372
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,360
Everything is below ground. Uh but what

373
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,040
are the implications of that? Well,

374
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,320
number one, anybody that's owning,

375
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,040
operating, and maintaining these

376
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,600
systems, you have to have confined space

377
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
uh trained and and certified uh uh

378
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
service technicians to be able to access

379
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,760
those vaults and be down inside those

380
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,839
spaces. It does make for a bit more

381
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,880
challenging for that maintenance and

382
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,680
repair if if needed. Um, you also have a

383
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,760
very uh high humidity environment. So,

384
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,839
you have to be careful with some of the

385
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,199
materials that are used. And then where

386
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,560
do you place these? Where do you have

387
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
room for these? Generally, in the

388
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,639
street, you may not have room because of

389
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,720
all the other utilities. So, are they

390
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,480
going to be placed in private property?

391
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,560
If so, you have to have easements and

392
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,760
and land access agreements to access

393
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,079
these vaults. Um, so just thinking that

394
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,519
all through about number one, who's the

395
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,519
owner? Who's going to own and operate

396
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,600
and maintain the system? What are their

397
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,519
capabilities? Where do you have space

398
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,199
for this stuff? And then, you know,

399
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,800
what's the longevity? What are what are

400
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
the service and maintenance implications

401
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
of having something below grade? If this

402
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,199
was in the street, it has to be vehicle

403
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,680
load rated, etc. Here's just a couple of

404
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,040
pictures of a project. Uh uh this was

405
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,040
the one I mentioned up in Markham,

406
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,120
Ontario. Uh that's been installed and

407
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,360
operating for a couple of years now. And

408
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,199
these uh they have 15 belowgrade vaults

409
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,199
all located in the street. So, as you

410
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,839
can see, you know, you have to access

411
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,480
those from a manhole down into the vault

412
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,000
to be able to get at the pumps, etc. Uh,

413
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,480
you still have electrical and some water

414
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,839
um uh pedestals above grade that you're

415
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,360
still going to see within the community.

416
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,079
So, where do you put those? Is that on

417
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,399
someone's private property or or is it,

418
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,880
you know, public property? Where does

419
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,880
that get located? So with these systems

420
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,399
we do have to con you know consider

421
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,880
technically where does all this stuff um

422
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,160
uh you know where do we place all of it

423
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,440
and um uh you know uh what are the cost

424
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
implications and then what are the

425
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,360
maintenance and future you know

426
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,600
accessibility to these systems uh look

427
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,040
like

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,279
and then I just talk a little bit about

429
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,000
modeling uh modeling these systems can

430
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,000
get quite complicated uh the bigger the

431
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,160
systems the different types of energy

432
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,079
sources is when you're adding in any

433
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,440
type of supplemental or hybridization of

434
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,959
the systems. Uh you know uh depending on

435
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,560
the building loads and the different

436
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,720
diversity of each of the buildings,

437
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,199
you're you need to model these in a

438
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,560
dynamic transient way that we can

439
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,720
actually really number one understand

440
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,360
how they're going to operate hour by

441
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,160
hour, yearbyear, you know, over the long

442
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,040
term. uh we need to understand and be

443
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,199
able to run sequence sequencing and

444
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,079
operational models or dispatch models so

445
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,800
we can really understand how to build

446
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,320
proper control schematics on on how to

447
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,560
operate these so we can give those to

448
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,519
the client. And then also just looking

449
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,920
at long-term what happens to the system

450
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,759
or throughout the year what happens when

451
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,400
you know one building shifts from

452
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,640
heating to cooling or uh you know maybe

453
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,919
one asset isn't available because of the

454
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,039
temperature profile or you know so so

455
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,480
there's a lot of different things that

456
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,240
are happening within these systems. And

457
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,199
then we can also really look at not just

458
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,000
the heat pump efficiencies we can also

459
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,400
dive into the the parasitic pump loss

460
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,039
efficiencies. And because one thing you

461
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,720
see with these large um uh thermal

462
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
energy networks is there's a lot of pump

463
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,039
energy. You the bigger they get, the

464
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,960
more pumping you have. And so how much

465
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,480
are we being penalized by connecting all

466
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,520
this together? Or is there different

467
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,320
ways we can do this to maintain small

468
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,640
parasitic losses on the pump side? And

469
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,720
so the cost to operate the system

470
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
doesn't offset as if you were to go

471
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,559
through and and maybe do these in

472
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
smaller pieces. So those are all things

473
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,039
that we need to really understand and

474
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,840
need to model correctly uh as we're

475
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,520
designing these systems. So again the

476
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
temperature profile of the ambient loop

477
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,799
I mentioned earlier we want all the

478
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,679
buildings to get roughly the same

479
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,520
efficiency and the same temperature. So

480
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
with that we need to model that

481
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,280
temperature profile throughout the year

482
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,880
and then obviously at the very coldest

483
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,880
point and the and the warmest point in

484
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,799
the year and what that looks like. So

485
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,559
this is that project in Markham, Ontario

486
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,400
where you can see all the different

487
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,640
energy sources injecting or rejecting

488
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
heat into that ambient loop and then how

489
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,480
it uh the temperature profile follows

490
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
that 2 miles of pipe around the

491
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,640
development. So we know that based on

492
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
this nobody's getting more than a 5

493
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
degree difference which means

494
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,440
everybody's getting really good and

495
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,280
pretty close to the same efficiencies at

496
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,720
their home.

497
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,280
And then of course we always look at

498
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,559
long-term net effects of of the system

499
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,960
especially when we're looking at

500
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,919
vertical ground loop heat exchangers and

501
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,679
if we have large uh um uh bore fields

502
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,280
that we could impact with either putting

503
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,600
too much heat in or taking too much heat

504
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,600
out and how that impacts the earth over

505
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
time. Uh and that's the other beautiful

506
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,440
thing about you know distributed thermal

507
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,200
assets is the smaller you make them and

508
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
the more distributed the less we're

509
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,280
going to have any impact of the earth

510
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,919
over the long haul versus if we put all

511
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,600
that into one area. Um so you can see

512
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,039
here that we've you know you model five

513
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,520
years you model 10 years um even as much

514
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,080
as 30 40 years just to see you know

515
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,919
what's the trend of that of that model

516
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,520
look like and you can see here that

517
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,880
there is no trend either going up or

518
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,280
down which means that we have a very

519
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,919
stable and consistent load profile both

520
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,760
energy in energy out so the ground is

521
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,080
going to be very stable over the long

522
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,679
term

523
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,520
and then we can also model all the

524
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,880
efficiencies of the system so these are

525
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,320
the the heat pumps throughout throughout

526
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,240
the year um or for one year of operation

527
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,840
that was in the third year both heating

528
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,799
and cooling. So that's every heat pump

529
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,440
in the system and looking at the coops

530
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,120
of those uh different buildings and how

531
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,960
they're operating on the system. So we

532
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,240
can look and go okay everybody's pretty

533
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,720
much operating around the same

534
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,720
efficiencies and we can also just get an

535
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,200
aggregate of the total coop of the

536
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,600
system not including pump energy but of

537
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,760
the heat pumps in the in the customers

538
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,080
that are being served by the system. So

539
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,240
we can really get a good snapshot of you

540
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,799
know how efficient these systems are and

541
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
is it is it penciling out to what you

542
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,679
know the consumers are going to expect

543
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,919
on their utility bills.

544
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,679
And then the last thing I would just say

545
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,600
uh you know when designing these systems

546
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,679
we really have to consider the expansion

547
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,559
of these systems in the future and how

548
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,159
are we doing that. Um, for instance, one

549
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,799
of the projects we worked on, uh, with

550
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
heat actually in Framingham, um, you

551
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
know, they had put some TE's and some

552
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,280
valves on the piping, thinking about

553
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,520
expansion, and then as we got into

554
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,760
designing the expansion, we realized

555
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,520
that that really wasn't done, uh, in a

556
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,159
way that could do it um, uh, the the

557
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,799
most optimized way for hydraulics and

558
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,480
for energy sharing. uh what what it was

559
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,600
initially thought was that you could

560
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,320
just use the entire center pipe as the

561
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,559
mix loop for connecting the two. Well,

562
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
hydraulically when you add the flow rate

563
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,600
of the second loop that increased the

564
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,280
pump sizes. Whoops. Uh it increased the

565
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,280
pump sizes dramatically for both

566
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,600
systems. Um so that really wasn't the

567
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,679
most optimized way to do that and

568
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,679
because the pipe wasn't large enough. So

569
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,919
rather than digging up and replacing

570
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,400
that entire section, creating two

571
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,159
smaller 20- foot mix loop sections on

572
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,000
each end and just replacing that section

573
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,840
uh and then modeling that to make sure

574
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,559
we can still transfer enough energy

575
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,480
within that 20 foot and see how that

576
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,240
worked to see whether or not that was a

577
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,159
good way to expand the system. But we

578
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,799
have to understand what is you know when

579
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,120
we look at a a system where would you

580
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,880
expand what's the building stock get

581
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,440
high level what are the loads of that

582
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,440
potential expansion loop are there

583
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,039
energy resources available on that

584
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,120
particular expansion loop or do I need

585
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,520
to feed it all from the original loop

586
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,360
you know how does that all work together

587
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,360
and so um this is showing how that mix

588
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,760
loop actually works those two different

589
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,240
spots which you can see here at the

590
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,240
beginning um and then at the at the

591
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,000
center of the loop where the two come

592
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,520
together for 20 foot and mix. You can

593
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
see that the temperatures actually do

594
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,880
benefit one another and bring the two

595
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,640
closer together as they operate uh

596
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,480
simultaneously. Even though you only

597
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,039
have two 20ft sections, we're still

598
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,960
getting shared energy benefit across

599
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,000
both of the loops. And actually the red

600
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,360
loop is is being benefited more from the

601
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
black loop because we've got a little

602
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,520
bit better temperatures on the on the

603
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,799
second loop, I should say, the phase 2

604
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,840
loop. Um so that's benefiting phase one.

605
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,559
Okay. And so uh as you can see here

606
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,320
we've we've lo you know um put numbers

607
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,240
on that where the actual mix loops are

608
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,320
one and three which is here one and

609
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,039
three and then how the systems kind of

610
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,280
operate together. So thinking about

611
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,240
expansion which direction you might

612
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,200
expand um and and then just thinking

613
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,960
about you know the hydraulics of it and

614
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
also the energy where is the energy

615
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,720
going to come from? Will there be new

616
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,799
energy assets being installed or does it

617
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,799
need to come from phase one of the

618
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,320
project? And so those are just kinds of

619
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,440
things that you can think through high

620
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,360
level as as you're designing a project

621
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,039
and asking clients, you know, is this

622
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,039
potentially going to be expanded? Which

623
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,480
direction would you expand? Are there

624
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,120
more customers that you already have in

625
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,120
mind that you want to add later on? Um,

626
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,600
so those are all some of the design

627
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
considerations that I consider when

628
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,640
designing these geothermal energy

629
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,919
networks. Really critical. um you know

630
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:37,679
from from the kind of major or six six

631
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,679
most critical uh considerations. So with

632
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,280
that, I thank you uh for your time.

633
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,280
Again, apologize I can't be there in

634
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,960
person. Wish I could have. Uh I'm sure

635
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,559
I'll see a bunch of you next week. And

636
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,559
uh I guess we're opening it up for

637
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,559
questions.
