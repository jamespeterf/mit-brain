1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,160
the probabilistic method in

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,400
combinatorics is a powerful way to

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,640
demonstrate the existence of certain

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,840
special configurations and combinatorial

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,439
objects by introducing

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,400
Randomness in this video we will see a

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,480
one of the earliest examples of an

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
application of this method and it's used

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,480
to prove lower bounds to Ramsey numbers

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,320
now Ramsey numbers are interesting

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,480
objects in combinatorics and they're

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,399
defined as follows the Ramsey number

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,840
rkl is defined to be the smallest

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,000
integer n such that no matter how we

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,840
color the edges of a complete graph on N

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,719
vertices will denote such objects by KNN

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,600
so complete graph is n vertices with all

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,600
the edges all n choose two edges

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,760
uh available and if we color all such

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,880
edges each one of them either with red

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,920
or green so one of two colors then there

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,400
always exists a red KL red click on K

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
vertices or green click on L vertices

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,840
right so the raming number is the

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,479
smallest n such that this is possible so

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,960
to be more concrete let me

27
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,920
demonstrate an

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,759
example so r33

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,119
equals to six and what this means is the

30
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:42,720
following first if we have six

31
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:46,600
vertices and we color all the possible

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,799
six choose two edges each one with one

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,600
of two colors red or green so for

34
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:56,399
example maybe these edges are colored

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,079
green and the remaining edges are

36
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,079
colored red

37
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,440
then no matter how we do these colorings

38
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,840
there always exists a triangle which is

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,400
completely red or completely

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:24,920
Green in this example here you see

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,080
this is a triangle that is completely

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,760
red on the other hand if we start with

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
only five vertices

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,800
then it is possible to

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,560
color the

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,560
edges with one of two

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,680
colors right so color each edge with one

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,120
of two colors so that there's no

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,239
monochromatic

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,920
triangle okay so this is what it means

51
00:02:51,239 --> 00:03:00,159
for r33 to be

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,360
six an important result in combinatorx

53
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,599
due to

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,599
Ramsey so this is known as Ramsey's

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,959
theorem and this was proved back

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,519
in the

57
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:20,200
1920s says

58
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,200
that this number rkl is always finite it

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,440
is always a well- defined number so as

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,239
long as n is large enough no matter how

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,319
we color the edges of a complete graph

62
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,959
on n vertic

63
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,840
there always exists a large

64
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,720
monochromatic either a large red K click

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,560
or a large green L

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,120
click what I want to prove in this video

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,959
is the following

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,560
theorem due to

69
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,560
ERS from the

70
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,239
1940s and ERS showed

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,560
that

72
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:05,959
rkk is bigger than 2 to the

73
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,280
k/2 for every integer K bigger than

74
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,280
three okay so this is a lower bound to

75
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,519
ring numbers and what it says that if

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,320
you have two few vertices namely if you

77
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,320
have 2 to the K over two vertices then

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,359
there is always a way to color the edges

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,479
with two colors so that there is no

80
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,479
monochromatic click on K

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,080
vertices a theorem is an important

82
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,000
foundational result and it's also one of

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,160
the earliest demonstrations of the

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,039
probabilistic method so we will see this

85
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,039
uh proof in this lecture in this

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,400
video in fact we will prove a slightly

87
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,400
more general

88
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,600
statement we will show that if two

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,600
integers n and

90
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,120
K

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,400
satisfy the following inequality n

92
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:09,600
choose K * 2 1 minus K choose 2 if this

93
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,680
quantity is less than

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,479
one so right now this is just some

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,880
formula it will come out of the proof so

96
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,880
let's not worry too much about

97
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,880
it

98
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:28,759
then

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,759
rkk is strictly larger than n

100
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
we will prove the second theorem and by

101
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,600
a calculation that is fairly

102
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,000
straightforward for which I will admit

103
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,240
one can use the second result to imply

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,039
the first

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,160
result okay so let us prove the second

106
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,039
theorem over here so what is it saying

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,440
if n satisfies certain inequalities so

108
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,560
that n is not too large then it is

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,759
possible to color the edges of a

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,560
complete graph on nver veres so that

111
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,560
there's no monochromatic click on K

112
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,120
vertices how do we find such a coloring

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,199
well let's do it

114
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,400
randomly so let's

115
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,400
color the

116
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:27,639
edges of a complete graph on K vertices

117
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,560
using two

118
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,560
colors uniformly and r

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,080
okay so meaning that for each Edge we

120
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,120
flip a coin if it comes up heads we

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,759
color it red if it comes up Tails we

122
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,960
color it

123
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,680
green and the goal is to find to show

124
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,400
that we can do this in such a way that

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,599
avoids having a monochromatic click of

126
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,759
size K so there are things that we want

127
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:03,879
to avoid and let us encode

128
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,879
bad events as follows for

129
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,919
every K

130
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,919
vertex

131
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,000
subset s of vertices there are n

132
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:23,000
vertices in total so for every K vertex

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,560
subset s we'll use a Subs to denote the

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
following bad event that we're trying to

135
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,520
avoid this is a

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,520
event that

137
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,720
s

138
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,720
induces

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
a

140
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,759
monochromatic

141
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:48,440
click okay it induces a monochromatic

142
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,440
click in this

143
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,199
coloring let's calculate the probability

144
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,199
that this occurs okay so what's the

145
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,159
probability that in this s which let's

146
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
say

147
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,560
case four for purpose of this

148
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,919
illustration you know of the six edges

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,479
all of them have the same color well

150
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,240
there are two possible colors and for

151
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,960
each of those colors the probability

152
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,840
that all of these edges are of that

153
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,599
color is this quantity 2 to the minus K

154
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,319
choose 2 so this is the probability 2 *

155
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,000
2 to Theus K choose 2 this is the

156
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,000
probability that s all the edges in s

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,960
are entirely of the same

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,479
color well

159
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:37,640
what about the probability that there is

160
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,360
some click of size K in the graph that

161
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,240
it's

162
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,200
monochromatic but that's really the

163
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,200
quantity that we care

164
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,320
about so let's consider the probability

165
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,920
that there

166
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,920
is

167
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
some

168
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,880
monochromatic click

169
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,000
of

170
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,000
size K in this

171
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,120
graph well if there's some monochromatic

172
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,440
click of size k then it must be one of

173
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,839
the s's so we can do what's called a

174
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,839
union

175
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,839
bound to Upper bound this probability by

176
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,200
the

177
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,120
sum of the individual event

178
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,560
probabilities so summing over o subsets

179
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,720
s of the vertices with size exactly K of

180
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,360
the probability that a Subs this event

181
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,600
occurs

182
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,839
okay in this summation there are n

183
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,360
choose K terms and each term is this

184
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,360
probability that we calculated

185
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,279
earlier and you see this expression it

186
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,000
was the expression in the hypothesis of

187
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,320
the theorem and we assume that it is

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,640
strictly less than

189
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,320
one and this is why we had this

190
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,000
expression in the

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,920
theorem okay great so the probability

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
that there exists some monochromatic

193
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,120
click of size K is strictly less than

194
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:25,839
one and

195
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,839
thus with positive probability

196
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,279
a random

197
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,440
coloring

198
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,440
has no

199
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,519
monochromatic

200
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,440
click of size

201
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,519
K okay and that's basically what we are

202
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,720
trying to do we are trying to demonst

203
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,880
rate the existence of a coloring with no

204
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,639
monochromatic click of size K and we

205
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,839
show that in fact by doing everything at

206
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,880
random the random coloring succeeds with

207
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,720
positive

208
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,560
probability and

209
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,800
therefore such an object must exist

210
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,480
right

211
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,480
thus such

212
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,600
coloring

213
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,399
exists and this finishes the proof of

214
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,880
this theorem over here that we trying to

215
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,120
demonstrate and as I mentioned earlier

216
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,880
by a more routine calculation which we

217
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,240
will not do here one can deduce air dous

218
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,399
result from this theorem and in fact by

219
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,680
a more careful calculation that again I

220
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:50,959
will not do one can show an even more

221
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,040
precise lower bound the rkk is bigger

222
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,959
than the following ASM totic one over

223
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,320
the following constant e * < tk2 so here

224
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:06,000
e is the natural constant around

225
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,839
2.71 plus a term that goes to zero as K

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,680
goes to

227
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:15,199
Infinity time k 2 to the k/2 so this is

228
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,040
a much more precise uh bound that one

229
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,839
can get out of analyzing the consequence

230
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,880
of this theorem that we just

231
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,560
proved in the next part of this video we

232
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,360
will refine or come up with additional

233
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,959
techniques that allows us to improve the

234
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,040
slower bound but for now let me make a

235
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:39,160
comment about this

236
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,399
technique what the stum shows is that by

237
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,360
doing a random coloring there is a

238
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,800
positive probability that this coloring

239
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,079
gets us what we

240
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,560
want and in fact the probability that

241
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:53,600
this coloring doesn't get us what we

242
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,519
want is this quantity here which is not

243
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,800
only less than one but it is actually

244
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,600
quite small it is very very small so if

245
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,279
you for example on a computer flip these

246
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,920
random coins and come up with this

247
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,199
coloring with very high probability it

248
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,320
will

249
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,639
succeed however it will be very

250
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,680
difficult to verify that you have

251
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,760
succeeded because the number of clicks

252
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,240
that one needs to check is n choose K

253
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,680
which grows very quickly as a function

254
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,800
of K so this is a phenomenon that is

255
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,720
sometimes called

256
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,720
finding KY in a h

257
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,880
stack a random coloring works with

258
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,880
overwhelming probability and so if you

259
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,680
just pick something at random it will't

260
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,160
work but one it is very hard to check

261
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,519
that what you found actually works and

262
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,120
two it is an active research Direction

263
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,759
and what seems to be a very difficult

264
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,600
problem to find other ways that does not

265
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,240
involve

266
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,680
Randomness but maybe even involving

267
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,759
Randomness in some other ways to

268
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,079
guarantee that what you found works and

269
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,720
this finding hay in a Hy stack describes

270
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,519
this phenomenal which is quite

271
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,680
counterintuitive that you know and also

272
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,480
demonstrates the power of the

273
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,839
probabilistic method that you know by

274
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,920
just doing everything at random it works

275
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,720
really really well but we don't

276
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,000
understand this process as much as we

277
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,839
would really like

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,199
to

279
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,639
so now you've seen a proof of A's

280
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,120
seminal result that gives a lower bound

281
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,880
to Ramsey numbers in the next two

282
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,800
segments of this video we will see a

283
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,040
couple of refinements to this technique

284
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,560
that allows us to get slightly better

285
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,360
lower bounds by introducing new ideas to

286
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,360
the probabilistic

287
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,440
method now let us introduce an

288
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,920
additional idea to the probabilistic

289
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,720
method to prove a slightly better lower

290
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,600
bound on Ramsey

291
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,440
numbers and this is a method of

292
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,800
alteration or the alteration

293
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,759
method what we will prove is the

294
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,399
following so let me write down the

295
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,079
statement it's slightly technical the

296
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,040
statement itself is not as important as

297
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
the ideas I will introduce so bear with

298
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,759
me for a

299
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,079
second theorem says that for any

300
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:24,440
positive integers K and

301
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:28,399
N the Ramsey number RK K is bigger than

302
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:33,959
the following quantity n minus n choose

303
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:36,880
k * 2 to the 1us k

304
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:41,040
2 okay so that's the theorem it gives

305
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,639
you a lower bound on Ramy numbers now by

306
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,399
optimizing over the value of K as a

307
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,120
value of n as a function of K we can

308
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,279
deduce the following

309
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
corollary and I will not show this

310
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,240
deduction here because it's a more

311
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:01,519
routine calculation so the corollary is

312
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:04,639
that rkk is bigger than the following

313
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:09,199
quantity 1/ e e is the the natural

314
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:11,480
constant 2.71 and so on plus little one

315
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,040
term that goes to zero as K goes to

316
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Infinity time K * 2 the

317
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,199
k/2 okay so that's the ASM totic lower

318
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,399
bound that one obtains by taking this

319
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,199
theorem and optimizing the value of n as

320
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,800
a function of K we see that it is

321
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,319
slightly better than the bound that we

322
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,720
got previously it's slightly better by a

323
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:37,959
factor of <

324
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,959
tk2 okay so let us prove this theorem

325
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,880
here like before we

326
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,600
will start with a random

327
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,880
coloring but then make some adjustments

328
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,360
so in fact this construction will have

329
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:56,639
two steps construct a random coloring in

330
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,639
two steps

331
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,640
in the first

332
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,079
step we'll do what we did previously

333
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,079
just do

334
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,079
randomly

335
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:25,199
color each

336
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,199
edge with one of two

337
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,840
colors uniformly at random

338
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,160
okay so flip a coin for each Edge and

339
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:43,440
color it with one of the two

340
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,320
colors now this coloring might have some

341
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,240
monochromatic K

342
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:52,520
Clicks in which case we will delete a

343
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,159
Vertex from each such K click and to

344
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:59,600
destroy all the monochromatic K clicks

345
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:02,600
so the second step is to delete a vertex

346
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
from

347
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,120
each

348
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,400
mono

349
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,400
chromatic K

350
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,720
click okay so after this process you see

351
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:20,400
what we are left with is an edge

352
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,679
coloring of some complete

353
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,600
graph where there are no monochromatic K

354
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,640
clicks left because we've destroyed all

355
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,760
such monochromatic K Clicks in the

356
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,760
second step of this process

357
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,120
how many vertices are left right so we

358
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,320
started with initially nend vertices but

359
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,559
in the second step we deleted some so we

360
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,400
don't have as many vertices as we

361
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,520
started with initially so let's ask

362
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,520
ourselves how

363
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,520
many

364
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,240
vertices are left at the end of this

365
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,200
process towards the goal let me

366
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:04,760
introduce a random variable X

367
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,760
and X is the number of

368
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,240
monochromatic K

369
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,240
clicks at the end of the first

370
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:32,159
step well the expectation of x

371
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,679
can be computed as follows which is very

372
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,720
similar calculation to what we did

373
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,400
earlier there n choose K possible K

374
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,520
clicks and each one of them is

375
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,240
monochromatic with probability 2 to the

376
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,600
1 minus K choose 2 so that's the

377
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,520
expected number of monochromatic K

378
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,520
clicks now in the second step of this

379
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,520
process we delete

380
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:04,640
some number of vertices and one vertex

381
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,600
for each monochromatic K click although

382
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,840
some vertices may be used to destroy

383
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,280
more than one monochromatic K click so

384
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,120
the number of vertices that we delete is

385
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,400
not necessarily X but it is no more than

386
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,400
x so delete at

387
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,480
most the size of X many vertices

388
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,400
right and

389
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:38,240
thus the final graph that we

390
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,400
get at the end of this two step

391
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:46,600
process

392
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,799
has at least n minus the size of X

393
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,360
vertices let me remind you that this is

394
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,159
a random process the final graph and its

395
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,720
coloring that we get is random and X is

396
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,559
also a random

397
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,840
quantity this is a number of ver es and

398
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,840
this quantity here has

399
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,240
expectation and minus expectation of the

400
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,960
size of

401
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,400
X so X is already a size so let me don't

402
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:25,360
have to use the absolute value

403
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:33,320
bars okay so the expectation is n

404
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:33,320
minus n choose K to to the 1 - K chose

405
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,120
2 okay so the final graph has at least

406
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,120
this many vertices in

407
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,760
expectation well that's the average

408
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,760
number through this random process and

409
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,840
thus there must always

410
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,480
be with some prob positive probability

411
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,840
some graph that beats this average so

412
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,400
thus therefore

413
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,400
with positive

414
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,720
probability the remaining

415
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,400
graph has at least this many

416
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:33,440
vertices and furthermore

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,440
it has no

418
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,360
monochromatic click on K vertices

419
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,960
because we destroyed all such Clicks in

420
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,880
the second step of this

421
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,799
process okay this finishes the proof of

422
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,440
this

423
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,200
theorem which as you see in the

424
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,120
corollary gives you a slightly better

425
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,799
lower bound compared to what we saw last

426
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,720
time in the third segment of this video

427
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:04,400
we'll see yet a new another technique

428
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,279
that gets us even further along to prove

429
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,799
an even better lower bound on the Ramsey

430
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,880
numbers earlier we saw two different

431
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,640
approaches to using the probabilistic

432
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,799
method to lower bound Ramsey numbers the

433
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,760
first method was by taking a union bound

434
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,679
to show that the sum of all the

435
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,720
probabilities of bad events is fairly

436
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,000
small and the second method is through

437
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,279
alteration where we start start by

438
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,279
constructing some random coloring and

439
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,480
then fix the

440
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,279
blemishes so we show that by removing

441
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,279
the bad parts removing the vertices that

442
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:44,600
contribute to monochromatic clicks we

443
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:47,000
can get a coloring with no monochromatic

444
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,279
clicks now let me introduce a more

445
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,240
advanced method that can get us even

446
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:56,440
further so the general motivation that

447
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,320
we already saw a couple of times is that

448
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:04,320
we wish to avoid

449
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,320
a certain collection of bad

450
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:15,720
events which will denote E1 through e

451
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,320
l okay so these are bad events in our

452
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,120
case the bad events correspond to having

453
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,159
a monochromatic click in the random

454
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:28,559
coloring there are some extreme

455
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,559
situations that are easier to handle

456
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,760
okay and this extrem these extreme

457
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,640
situations are one of two types the

458
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,159
first is

459
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,880
when the events collectively have very

460
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,840
small probability even when they when

461
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,000
you just sum the probabilities of these

462
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,159
events so for example if the sum of the

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,720
probabilities of these bad events

464
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:05,080
is less than one then we can apply the

465
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,080
union

466
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,279
bound to deduce

467
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,240
that with positive probability none of

468
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,360
the bad events occur so that's an easy

469
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,360
situation to

470
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,000
handle another easy situation to handle

471
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,480
is

472
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,480
if all the

473
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,559
events all the bad events are are

474
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,640
independent so if they are independent

475
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:44,240
events then the

476
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:48,760
probability that none of them

477
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,600
occurs is equal to the product of the

478
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,080
probabilities that the individual events

479
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,080
do not occur

480
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:05,760
and this is positive provided that all

481
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,520
the individual event probabilities are

482
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,520
strictly less than

483
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,480
one now this situation typically does

484
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,880
not a it's not the case uh in a lot of

485
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,240
applications including the one that

486
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,200
we're considering for example having two

487
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,840
triangles if they intersect at an edge

488
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,159
if they overlap by an edge then them

489
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,640
being uh well if if you have two clicks

490
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:32,679
that intersect in uh in in some large

491
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,960
portion then having them individually

492
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,960
being monochromatic are not independent

493
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:45,320
events so what we're often dealing with

494
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,320
is situations where there is some

495
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,880
dependencies so some event dependencies

496
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,600
and often these are the hardest and most

497
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,200
interesting situations that one has to

498
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,679
deal with in the probabilistic

499
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:16,480
method a powerful

500
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,480
tool that we will see is the lowas local

501
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,159
Lemo

502
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,520
okay so let me explain what is a low

503
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,840
local Lum and then apply it to the

504
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,159
problem of lower bounds to reny number

505
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,679
so here is a version of the statement of

506
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,799
the lowas local

507
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,440
LMA and specifically appli to a setting

508
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,279
known as the random variable

509
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,279
model random variables

510
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:50,960
model the setting is as

511
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:55,640
follows suppose we have X1 through XV

512
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,640
and these are random variables

513
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,880
and importantly they are independent

514
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,840
random

515
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,799
variables so think of them as

516
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,840
independent coin tosses the outcomes of

517
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:15,600
independent random coin

518
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,200
tosses we'll have B1 through

519
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,039
b

520
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:26,919
m denote index sets so they are

521
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:30,480
subsets of numbers one through

522
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:30,480
V and for

523
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:38,279
each I ranging from one through

524
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,840
M

525
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:44,440
let

526
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,440
EI be some

527
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:50,039
event

528
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,039
that

529
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,080
depends

530
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,279
only

531
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,279
on the variables

532
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:12,200
indexed by bi

533
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:15,200
namely the variables X subj as J ranges

534
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,200
over the elements of

535
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,200
bi so this is a situation that captures

536
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,760
a lot of applications where you have bad

537
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,480
events for example clicks being

538
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,679
monochromatic in a coloring of a large

539
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,559
graph

540
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,039
and some of these events May have

541
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,440
dependencies because the events are

542
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,399
based on some underlying coin tosses

543
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,039
underlying independent random variables

544
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,159
and the different different events may

545
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,799
involve overlapping

546
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,720
variables so this is capturing that kind

547
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,720
of

548
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,440
setup now let me introduce some

549
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,399
hypotheses that captures a notion of a

550
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:01,080
weak amount of dependence a small amount

551
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,080
of dependence so suppose for

552
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,919
every

553
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,919
I from 1 to

554
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,200
M the set the index set

555
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,200
bi is

556
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,480
disjointed

557
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
from o but at

558
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,200
most

559
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,320
D other BJ

560
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,240
so D here is some other parameter in the

561
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,159
theorem so

562
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,360
hbi is has overlapping variables with a

563
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,360
small number of other

564
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,760
BJs and

565
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,120
furthermore another hypothesis is that

566
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,120
each bad

567
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,320
event occurs with some

568
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:02,279
probability which is not too large so 1/

569
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,080
D + 1

570
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:09,519
time constant e here e is the natural

571
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:13,639
constant 2 * 71 so on and this is true

572
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:16,480
for every I okay so let me fact just

573
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,480
write it a little bit more

574
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,320
clearly like

575
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,000
this okay so these are the hypothesis um

576
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,200
so there a lot but roughly speaking it's

577
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,240
saying that every bad

578
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,360
event is related to only a small number

579
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,039
of other bad events and each event

580
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,960
occurs with not too high probability

581
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,799
which depends not on the total number of

582
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,159
events but only on this D which is the

583
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,799
number of other events that it is

584
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,799
associated

585
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,279
with the

586
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,399
conclusion is

587
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:59,799
that the probability

588
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,440
that

589
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,440
none of the bad

590
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:12,120
events so the bad events are the indexed

591
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,060
are the events indexed

592
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,240
um okay so none of the bad events E1

593
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,240
[Music]

594
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,760
through

595
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,399
em

596
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,399
occurs is strictly positive so with

597
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,399
positive probability none of these bad

598
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,120
events occur

599
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,480
okay so that's the statement of the low

600
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,480
local

601
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:41,919
L and now let us apply this local Lama

602
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:45,840
to prove a even better lower bound than

603
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,639
what we saw earlier for Ramsey numbers

604
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,960
we will not be able to prove the local

605
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:53,559
Lama in this video so its proof is

606
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:59,320
although not long quite intricate and I

607
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:59,320
refer you to the references for a proof

608
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:11,080
so let us now see a lower bound to

609
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:15,279
ranging numbers and this is a result due

610
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,279
to Spencer Joel Spencer from the

611
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,720
70s and it says that if

612
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:47,559
if K choose 2 okay times n choose

613
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:52,840
two n minus 2 choose K minus 2 + 1 * 2

614
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:54,799
to the 1 - K CH 2 is less than 1 over

615
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,279
e

616
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:03,519
then the ranging number rkk

617
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:06,440
is strictly bigger than M okay so as

618
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,200
with earlier this is some mysterious

619
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,599
looking formula and I want you to not

620
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,440
worry too much about it it will come out

621
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,119
of the proof

622
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,520
um what may be more Illuminating is the

623
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,040
consequence of the

624
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,040
theorem so as a

625
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,520
corollary

626
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:32,320
rkk has the lower bound one um so lower

627
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:36,560
bound following ASM totic < tk2 / e plus

628
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,760
of 1 K * 2 K over

629
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,639
two and this yet beats the bound that we

630
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,760
saw earlier by another factor of root2

631
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,960
now this may seem like a small

632
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,480
Improvement and quantitatively indeed

633
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,440
it's only a constant Factor more whereas

634
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,720
the remaining astics um we do not know

635
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,960
how far it is away from the actual truth

636
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:04,119
but yet this result proed in the' 70s is

637
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,119
the best known lower bound to date for

638
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:12,760
diagonal Ramsey numbers this RK

639
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:15,839
case okay so let us now see the proof of

640
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,680
this theorem of spener which applies the

641
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,680
low vast local

642
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,640
Lama as earlier we will Begin by color

643
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,640
coloring the edges

644
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,280
of the complete graph on N vertices with

645
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,280
two

646
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,720
colors uniformly at

647
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:57,640
random okay and also similar to the

648
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,640
first proof that we saw for every

649
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,720
K

650
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,640
vertex subset

651
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,040
s let

652
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,599
us Define a bad event e Subs to

653
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:23,560
be the event

654
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,240
that

655
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,440
s

656
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,440
induces a monochromatic

657
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,880
click on the vertices in

658
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,800
s and we also saw earlier that the

659
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:49,760
probability of this bad event is 2 rais

660
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,760
to 1 minus K choose

661
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,160
2

662
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,079
okay let us see how this setup

663
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,400
corresponds to this random variable

664
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:04,040
setup

665
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,040
earlier the

666
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,680
variables correspond to

667
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,040
the

668
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,040
coloring of the

669
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,359
edges so in other words these are

670
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,800
indexed by

671
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,079
the N choose

672
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,839
two edges

673
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:35,319
of the complete graph km so there are n

674
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,280
choose two such

675
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:44,319
variables well what about this condition

676
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,319
here so B bis right so each

677
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,680
bi is a set

678
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,000
of

679
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,880
size K choose two corresponding to the

680
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,839
edges of this complete graph inside this

681
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,920
click of size

682
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,920
K so when do the bis

683
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:14,200
overlap so the uh if S and S Prime so

684
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,440
both K vertex

685
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,440
subsets of

686
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:28,560
vertices if they um so if the these are

687
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,560
both K vertex subsets then

688
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,560
their

689
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,560
clicks overlap in

690
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,440
edges if and only

691
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,040
if the sets of vertices S and S Prime

692
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:59,160
overlapping at least two vertices so as

693
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:03,960
an illustration if you you

694
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:07,880
have this click of size four and another

695
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,599
click of size four then they overlap in

696
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:15,640
at least one Edge if and only if the

697
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,640
vertex sets overlap in at least two

698
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,880
vertices so to apply the local Lama we

699
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,960
need to check how many other s s primes

700
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,040
intersect a given s in terms of their

701
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,160
Edge set and this is a calculation that

702
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,400
we can do as

703
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,200
follows for

704
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,400
each K

705
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,520
vertex

706
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,079
s the

707
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,960
number of K

708
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,680
vertex s primes

709
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,560
that

710
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:57,920
has intersection size at least two with

711
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,240
s is at most the following

712
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:07,000
well I need to pick a pair of vertices

713
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:10,480
of s where there's this overlap and then

714
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,520
choose and choose and then select the

715
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,720
remaining vertices of S Prime from the

716
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,520
remaining and choose two vertices of the

717
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,200
entire uh

718
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,760
click there are some possible overcount

719
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,599
here because some s primes may be

720
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,040
counted in more than one way through

721
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,480
this formula here um but it is certainly

722
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,480
an upper

723
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,200
bound and now we can apply the local

724
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:55,480
Lemo okay by applying the local Lama one

725
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:59,079
checks that as long as this hypothesis

726
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,599
inequality is satisfied

727
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:07,280
this hypothesis in the statement of the

728
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:11,640
local LMA is satisfied as well so

729
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,560
this inequality here corresponds

730
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,920
to this

731
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,000
inequality in hypothesis so this it is

732
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,760
satisfied and so we can apply the local

733
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,760
Lama to

734
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,760
deduce

735
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,560
that with

736
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,560
positive

737
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:35,520
probability none of the bad

738
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,599
events so none of the bad events es

739
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,599
occur

740
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,400
for ranging over all K vertex subsets s

741
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,280
in the

742
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,880
graph and

743
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,680
therefore with positive

744
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,079
probability none of the K vertex subsets

745
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,200
induce a monochromatic

746
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:05,560
click and that's exactly what we're

747
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,599
trying to show with this result over the

748
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,680
disclaim over here and this concludes

749
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,119
the proof of Spencer's

750
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,480
theorem so you see that this is a

751
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:20,720
demonstration of the powerful lovas lool

752
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:24,640
Lama and it is a very interesting method

753
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,359
that was um pioneered by lovas and has

754
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,359
had important applications subsequently

755
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,520
in the development of the probabilistic

756
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,520
method although we did not see the proof

757
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,760
of the local LMA here today I hope that

758
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,480
you can at least appreciate its

759
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,319
application and throughout this lecture

760
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,760
throughout this video we saw three

761
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:45,920
different approaches to lower bounding

762
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,200
