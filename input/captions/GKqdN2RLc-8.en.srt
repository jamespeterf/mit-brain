1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,200
the MIT skydiving Club just jumped out

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,160
of an airplane it might seem like a wild

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,880
adrenaline rush but actually there's a

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
lot more to skydiving than just jumping

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,759
out of a plane and pulling a rip cord

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,480
when you're just falling a few feet

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,840
there's not much you can do on the way

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,400
down so how is falling thousands of feet

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
through the sky any different you learn

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,320
in school that things accelerate towards

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,800
the ground because of

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,800
gravity gravity pulls skydivers toward

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,680
the Earth but as we fall tiny air

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,879
molecules bump into

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,440
US each tiny bump causes a little bit of

16
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,000
force against our bodies the hit from

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,760
one air molecule may not seem like a lot

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,039
but when you add all those tiny forces

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,719
up you get a big Force called drag which

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,239
pushes up opposite to gravity skydiving

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,280
may seem like it defies the laws of

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,480
physics but in the end it's just playing

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,920
with the wind for more MIT moments from
