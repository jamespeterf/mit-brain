1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,080
Technology isn't what you think it is.

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
We all use the word technology as if it

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,960
meant the same thing to all of us. But

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
are you sure we all mean the same? To a

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
researcher, technology is what's on a

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,840
research paper. To an engineer, it might

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,119
be a prototype or a system. In

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,760
government and in the military,

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,840
everything hinges on requirements.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,320
Investors seem to associate technology

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,760
with industries and valuations. To an

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
office worker, it is the stuff we do

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,079
with computers, information technology.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,800
In MBA programs, the word is used as a

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,600
synonym for product. This leads to many

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,360
comical situations. For example, at MIT,

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,800
enterprising researchers in engineering

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
or science will describe what they've

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
invented to business students, hoping

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
that these students will get it and will

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,760
solve for the product to build.

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,199
Meanwhile, the same business students

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,960
eager to work with technologies are

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,479
hoping for the precise opposite. That

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
the researcher will have figured out the

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
product already so they can wrap a

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,360
business around it. They all use the

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
word technology, but they mean different

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
things. And they each hope that the

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,080
other party will have done the work of

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
figuring out where the technology fits.

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
The same happens when government

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
agencies in science and technology seek

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,720
sponsors to commercialize ideas or when

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,119
the military seeks to transition

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
technology to operations. In the new

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
mindset, we think about technology

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,880
differently. It is neither the product

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,280
nor the paper. Technology creates

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,960
options. You can reshape technology.

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
This should be obvious, but often it

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,280
isn't. Take lasers for example. Today

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
they're used everywhere. In

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,520
presentations, to carry information over

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,240
long distances, barcode readers,

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,560
military, computing. We know the laser

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,880
is good for many things. But years after

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,520
he invented it, Dr. Mayman still called

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
it a solution in search of a problem.

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
This is why thinking in products leads

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,759
to paradoxes. Sure, you could interview

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,680
users for the first laser, but who are

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,280
they? We all hope that something about

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
the technology will tell us what it is

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,920
good for and what to use it for. But the

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,640
fact is that at the start, nothing is

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
new or obvious. To go from that first

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,440
hunch or paper to impact, you're going

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
to have to work on and reshape what you

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
start with. Technology gives you

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,760
options. It is malleable. It can be

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
reshaped. Here are some examples of what

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,520
I mean by creating options. These

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
examples come from the work of students

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
in our MIT class and they show how one

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,160
technology has led to unexpected uses,

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
sometimes more than one. Jeff Grman's

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,760
laboratory developed a powder that

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
stored heat in the cold. It was meant to

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,599
help increase the efficiency of solar

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
energy concentration plants. Students in

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,800
the class determined that if laced in

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
fabric, the same technology could help

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,440
create selfwarming high fashion

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,120
clothing. They took the technology from

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,879
energy to fashion. Another example, Joel

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,400
Dawson's lab invented a new kind of

78
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,800
circuit that increased battery life by

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
about 10%. At the time, the prevalent

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,319
phone was the iPhone 1. Students in the

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,519
class found out how to adapt the

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,200
technology to manage energy in the

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
telephone network instead, where it

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
saved millions and end up founding two

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,400
different companies from the same

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
technology. Both companies were

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,120
eventually acquired by large

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,920
infrastructure equipment companies.

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
That's one technology, two companies.

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,920
These examples are from my MIT class.

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
And so they may lead you to believe that

92
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,239
you need a technology to start. So let

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
me give you two examples involving

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,959
technologies born out of repurposing

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,959
other knowledge. The first laser emerged

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,879
out of a pet project in an industrial

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,799
lab and it was produced with parts

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,879
ordered from a catalog like a

99
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,879
photography flashlight or a ruby crystal

100
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,040
cut to order. Nothing was new.

101
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,720
Everything was repurposed. Early in my

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,799
career, we created a company to locate

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,319
cell phones in case of emergency. The

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
problem to solve came to us from a new

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
regulation from the Federal

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,959
Communications Commission. We invented

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,720
an artificial intelligence technology to

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,239
solve the problem. However, the

109
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,640
technology was inspired by a chemical

110
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
engineering thesis. Students often come

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,120
into class expecting to find the ideal

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,799
use for one technology. They learn to

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
appreciate that one technology creates

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,040
many options. This means that technology

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
investments are made risky not by the

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,080
technology itself, but by how we try to

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,799
narrow technologies down to one obvious

118
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
use. So do not narrow it all to just one

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,479
use. Challenge yourself to find those

120
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,120
options. There are ways to do it

121
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,720
systematically. In my class, students

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
start with keeping at least three

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
options open. Having options is

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
convenient because, as you'll realize in

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,000
the next video, real world problems are

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,000
interesting because there are many ways

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,530
to chip at them. That's how technology

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,430
gets you to solve problems.
