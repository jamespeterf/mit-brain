00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,040
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,440
my name is Erica capable James I'm a

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,399
professor of medical anthropology and

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,879
urban studies at the Massachusetts

5
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,879
Institute of

6
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,920
Technology and it is my very great honor

7
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,480
to be able to introduce an important

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,160
topic that is critical to the world

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,559
today and that is thinking about the

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,600
future of Gaza and as specifically

11
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:59,440
healthc care in Gaza uh we are very

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,160
fortunate to have three experts who are

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,720
going to speaking about their personal

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,720
experiences and their lived experiences

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,320
both as Palestinians and as uh

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,680
individuals who have volunteered and

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,439
spent a tremendous amount of time

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,520
working in both Israel and

19
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:20,759
Palestine these issues are important not

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,040
just because of the the the current

21
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,920
acute phase of conflict but also because

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,439
so many countries around the world are

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,600
struggling with what to do during and

24
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,000
after conf conflict how to bring people

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,920
who have suffered

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
tremendously uh back to health back to

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,439
mental health and you know to begin re

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,280
building their lives I'm familiar with

29
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,560
these topics from my own research in

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,439
Haiti over the past 30 years now and I

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,000
see that the cycles of conflict and

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,360
violence sometimes recur when healing

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,399
does not take place um for individuals

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,439
families and communities there also

35
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,719
needs to

36
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:07,680
justice so without further Ado I'd like

37
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:11,039
to introduce uh Dr Iman Ansari who's a

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,599

social justice not only for the

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,720
Palestinians but in general um after my

66
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,879
kids um grew um a bit older and I was

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,680
able to travel away I started uh going

68
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,080
to Palestine on medical missions um

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,720
through an NGO called uh Palestine

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,720
children Relief Fund

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,760
pcrf and um after many years of um going

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,200
on missions over there to uh

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,360
specifically to the West Bank um I

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,720
joined the board uh of directors of pcrf

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,360
and um I'm currently on their board of

76
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,879
directors my path into medicine is the

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,040
is not an unusual path I used to think

78
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,840
um whenever I I talk about my path uh to

79
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,319
my American friends that um you know

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,720
maybe because I'm coming from the Middle

81
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:15,519
East it's different but I think it is a

82
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,560
shared path um I was born and raised in

83
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,639
soui Arabia to uh two parents who are

84
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,479
Palestinians my father was born in um

85
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:28,240
safad a town um city in the north um on

86
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,360
the mountain in the Galilee um and my

87
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,400
mother was born in haa

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,880
and in 1948 uh they were forcibly

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,639
displaced to uh Syria they grew up there

90
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,360
and then they got married moved to Saudi

91
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,440
Arabia where I was born and raised very

92
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,759
traditional home very traditional

93
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,800
expectation education was super

94
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,160
important for my parents they wanted us

95
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,360
to have um University degree uh but for

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,520
the girl they preferred that I have like

97
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,800
English literature degree or Arabic

98
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,720
literature or even science but uh

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,280
ultimate goal is I'll have the degree

100
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,120
I'll put it in the kitchen and I'll

101
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,120
become the best mother ever um so for me

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,880
to ask to go to Medicine was pretty

103
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,080
unusual um my older brother is a

104
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,080
cardiologist and he preceded me in uh

105
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,960
going to medicine and I thought um the

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
smartest people go to Medicine you get

107
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,919
to help people you get to make a

108
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,600
difference I wanted to make a difference

109
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,880
and um I decided to go to Medicine

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,160
initially my father um did not uh did

111
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,160
not approve um and we tried we tried our

112
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,280
hardest with aunts and uncles and

113
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,759
grandparents to convince my dad and

114
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,039
eventually my brother told him you know

115
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,600
she's pretty headstrong so uh let her go

116
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,720
to Medicine she'll be busy with with

117
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,080
school workor and um and exams that she

118
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,560
will not have time for trouble and my

119
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,360
father you know bought that um argument

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,520
that rationale and allowed me to go to

121
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,520
Medicine and then forced my two sisters

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,039
after me to to pursue the same path to

123
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,039
keep them busy um finished medical

124
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,160
school in Saudi Arabia again I wanted to

125
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,759
come to the US uh to do postgraduate

126
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,000
training like my brother and my father

127
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,440
said no unless I was married uh so when

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,599
my um now husband asked to meet me and

129
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,479
get to know me I told him let's cut to

130
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,360
the chase do you want to marry me but

131
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,199
I'm on a mission I'm coming to the US

132
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,880
and he said fine so we got married and

133
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,000
came here and um I've been mostly in

134
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,639
Boston ever since I did residency at

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,280
Tufts and then my pulmonary and critical

136
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,759
care Fellowship where at children at

137
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,400
Children's Hospital I went to Cincinnati

138
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,360
briefly um and then came back to Boston

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,319
and um from there um like my work has

140
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,599
focused on my clinical work um I have

141
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,879
four children that I raised here in um

142
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,599
in Newton in

143
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,879
Massachusetts and uh over the past six

144
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:06,000
years um my humanitarian work uh became

145
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:09,280
of um serious um level of importance to

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,639
me um one thing I will say as I have one

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,800
more minute before I I turn it to our

148
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:21,440
first guest um uh when I went for the

149
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,280
first time to Palestine and Israel um it

150
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,479
was a very emotional visit I've never

151
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,599
been there before I've never um had

152
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,280
immediate family live there I don't know

153
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,039
what is there so when I went there I

154
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,400
went just like any American who's

155
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,080
visiting that land for the first time

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,479
and it was an

157
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,240
eyeopener um we'll talk more in our

158
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:47,960
conversations um about health care over

159
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,120
there um but um I had a sense of

160
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,000
responsibility to as a pediatrician to

161
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,440
the children over there because they

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,240
could have been me and they deserve the

163
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:03,360
same health care that my children are

164
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,080
getting in Boston and that gave me that

165
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,800
you know sense of responsibility and

166
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,159
commitment that I will do everything I

167
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,319
can to elevate the level of Health Care

168
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,199
over there to help people there um be

169
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,360
treated with the same standard of care

170
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,879

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,480
friends neighbors and in the subsequent

188
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,320
weeks and months she lost also friends

189
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,040
in

190
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:17,640
RDA across the border uh during Israel's

191
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:20,640
um um devastating military campaign on

192
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,360
razza um throughout this traumatic

193
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,000
period in her life she refused to

194
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:31,200
surrender uh her sorrow or concern for

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,200
all innocent victims of violence um Yaba

196
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,839
um um can you tell us about um your

197
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,600
background and your path into Medicine

198
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,920
sure so uh as you as you mentioned I'm a

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,000
Palestinian citizen of Israel um many

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,480
many people are not really familiar with

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,959
this definition uh some call us Israeli

202
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,160
Arabs or some other definition but

203
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,240
actually like 20 21% of Israeli citizens

204
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,560
are actually Palestinians who are um

205
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,160
whose Heritage is Palestinian and um

206
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,519
they were basically not refugees after U

207
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:10,680
the n in 1948 so my ancestors um uh

208
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,200
stayed in the makab the the desert area

209
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,440
of Israel the South part um and we're

210
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,480
we're Palestinian uh with with an

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:23,880
Israeli citizenship and I grew up as a

212
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,519
as a a bedwin girl in in Israel um but

213
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,160
my parents as in a way similar to your

214
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,279
parents really wanted us to get good

215
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,839
education so I actually grew up in a in

216
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:38,200
a Jewish town in Israel um which made it

217
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:41,000
easier for me I guess to to get into um

218
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,519
medical school because the the education

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,600
system in Israel is very segregated so

220
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,160
there's like a um an education system

221
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
for Arabs and education system for

222
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,800
Jewish people and because I I grew up in

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,720
a Jewish town uh I I had the privilege

224
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,680
to go into a Jewish um Hebrew speaking

225
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,160
school um and I I always knew that I

226
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,680
wanted to go uh into medicine first

227
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,120
because my mother was diagnosed with

228
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,480
breast cancer um when I was

229
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,959
14 um and but also I felt like this is

230
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,160
the best way to to help people and

231
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,120
especially I wanted I always knew I

232
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,440
wanted to go back to my own Community

233
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,560
the bedwin community was very much

234
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,880
underserved um and and helped them and

235
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,600
actually after I I I went to medical

236
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,279
school in Jerusalem the Hebrew

237
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,560
University and when I graduated I I did

238
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:33,040
my internship and my residency in sooka

239
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,160
medical center in beleva uh which is

240
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,519
like the biggest biggest city in the in

241
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,920
the South um and and was actually

242
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,720
started my social activism and some

243
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,959
political activism as well um looking

244
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,360
into Health disparities and working to

245
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:55,240
promote um Better Health Care or Health

246
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,040
Equity for uh uh bedwin patients uh

247
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,920
starting with trying to prevent genetic

248
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,720
diseases but uh later on I had some

249
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,360
projects on diabetes and and uh um

250
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,760
trying to promote and uh advocate for

251
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,480
better access to

252
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,279
healthcare um as many of the bedwin in

253
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,880
this area live in um unrecognized

254
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:18,600
Villages so they're like these um places

255
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,279
that are not recognized by by the formal

256
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,199
authorities in Israel so they they're

257
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,600
not entitled to basic infastructure like

258
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,959
you know um uh electricity running water

259
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,760
uh shelters which is one thing that we

260
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:37,600
um we had to deal with uh as of October

261
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,839
7th 2023 and like 100,000 people are um

262
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,839
getting direct hits by Rockets but they

263
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,680
have nowhere to run uh because there are

264
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,760
no shelters um and no clinics and even

265
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,160
like the the a small amount of clinics

266
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,000
that there were that we had there

267
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,920
actually shut down um after October 7th

268
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,519
uh so that's that's how I um I knew that

269
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,920
I wanted always to you know help those

270
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,560
who are most in need uh and also that's

271
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,560
how I got in a way to my research Focus

272
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,040
which is um politics of healthcare or

273
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,880
the intersection between Healthcare and

274
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,680
politics and I guess we're going to talk

275
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,240
a little bit about this um later

276
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,120
on but mean you were able to enter Gazza

277
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,800
because my understanding is that um

278
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,320
Israelis cannot could not enter Gaza

279
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,360
correct for us it's illegal um so

280
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,360
basically what I did so on October 7th I

281
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,480
was uh I was an attending in sooka so in

282
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,639
Bersa and I woke woke up uh at 6:30 a.m

283
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,399
with like this the the alarms and the

284
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,079
sirens and the uh sounds of rockets

285
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,399
falling um which sadly for me as someone

286
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,680
who grew up in this area is we're used

287
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,759
to it so uh for me it was like okay

288
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,639
another another morning uh of yet again

289
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:59,600
hearing Sirens but then I I went to the

290
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,720
hospital um and the the patient started

291
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,320
coming so the patients from the the the

292
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,000
Kim the Gaza envelope the bed Villages

293
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,880
started coming and this is when we

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,040
figure it out that this is this is

295
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,519
different from what we uh we we know and

296
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,000
I have to say I was trained in this

297
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:23,199
Hospital uh it's the busiest emergency

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,680
room in Israel and I've never seen it um

299
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,759
the way I've seen it this day hundreds

300
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
of patients hundreds of bodies many

301
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,639
people came already you know Dead on

302
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,759
Arrival um even kids who were directly

303
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,079
hit by

304
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:41,759
Rockets um but I I I have to say I

305
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:45,360
um at some point like in the afternoon

306
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,000
of this of this day which was really

307
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,279
devastating

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,160
um I looked around and I saw that the

309
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,600
people around me both patients and

310
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,480
Physicians who were both Jewish and

311
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,440
Arabs or Jewish Israelis and

312
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,160
Palestinians

313
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,959
um and and I think I two things came to

314
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,519
my mind when I saw this the first was as

315
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,000
I said I we're kind of like used to the

316
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,880
armed conflicts or what we call military

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,560
operations right um so the one thing

318
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,800
that that came to my mind is like okay

319
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,480
now I know how War looks like looks like

320
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,959
and how it looks like on the other side

321
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,040
when the Israeli Army is bombing Gaza

322
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,800
because it's the again the separation is

323
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,399
so

324
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,560
um strict that I don't really get to it

325
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,440
is it is illegal for me to go into Gaza

326
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,920
even though like uh I have friends there

327
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,279
I family members there so we don't

328
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,560
really know what's going on there uh but

329
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:50,240
on October 7th I I felt like I had some

330
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,880
uh idea and then the second thing that I

331
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,240
that I've thought of is that this is we

332
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,199
keep saying that this is a conflict

333
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,639
between you know Jews and Arabs or like

334
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:03,079
Israelis and Palestinians but honestly

335
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,800
no this is um um at this moment in time

336
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,399
I figure that this is a conflict between

337
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,240
people who believe that violence is the

338
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,839
answer and we need to you know with more

339
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,839
violence we will try to we will solve

340
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,959
this conflict and people who are

341
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,759
actually believing in in saving lives

342
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,639
and in humanity and um they dropped

343
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:26,199
everything and came to the hospital that

344
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,519
day uh to save lives and after that in

345
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,480
the past in the uh three months after

346
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,000
that the before I moved to

347
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,880
Boston um we opened another unit and and

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,040
I did a lot of uh work in the community

349
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,199
to help people who were again directly

350
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,040
hit by by rockets and we did try to go

351
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,639
into Gaza I uh I volunteer with physics

352
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,079
for human rights Israel and they had

353
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,519
mobile clinics in Gaza but they couldn't

354
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:54,680
again it was illegal for them to go in

355
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:59,240
but uh we continued to uh stay in touch

356
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:02,040
with um um with the hospitals there and

357
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,520
with some uh Hospital directors and

358
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,720
Physicians and in the past year since

359
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,400
then we've also fundraised um I was um

360
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,679
involved with many other organizations

361
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,799
and we fundraised over three $3 million

362
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,439
um to World Central Kitchen to get into

363
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,039
um to give it to humanitarian aids to

364
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,559
gasa and specifically

365
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,559
food um and since then I've been

366
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,840
documenting um what was happening

367
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,200
specifically attacks on health care in

368
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,080
Gaza speaking to friends and colleagues

369
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,400
who um who are working

370
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,679
there um and maybe just to give some

371
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,320
some data uh is that and I don't know

372
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,440
how how um people like how

373
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,799
knowledgeable um the you know the

374
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,360
general population is about this but uh

375
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,760
since October

376
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,120
7th

377
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,440
um about more than 50% of the hospitals

378
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,120
in Gaza are are now non-functional so

379
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,320
they had um

380
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:10,039
36 original hospitals and now only 16

381
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,120
are functional uh the last one that was

382
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,640
um uh that was that actually collapsed

383
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,039
was kamarad Juan in the southern part of

384
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,960
Gaza that was actually evacuated on

385
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,600
December

386
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,880
28th uh and um the director was uh

387
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,919
detained and still like the his location

388
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,559
is

389
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,039
unknown um

390
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:37,480
the actually according to the

391
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:40,880
wh um data in the past year there was

392
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,159
about 1500 attacks on health care

393
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,480
facilities and staff in armed conflicts

394
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:51,280
around the world more than a thousand of

395
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,440
them uh were against um health care

396
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,919
facilities and and staff in Gaza

397
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:01,200
specifically um so this is kind of like

398
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:05,080
um at least for me it's a it's a it's an

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,799
obvious case of it's not either or it's

400
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,720
bad to you know to

401
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,200
um OB it's it's it's even crazy for me

402
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,120
that I need to say that it's bad to kill

403
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,200
people right and it's bad to act in

404
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,799
violence and I've seen it for both s

405
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,200
like in both sides both in Israel

406
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,520
against Israelis uh and against in

407
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,039
Palestinians in

408
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,080
Gaza uh and I'm I'm so glad that we're

409
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,520
having this conversation because I think

410
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,000
more people should know what's going on

411
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,720
there and we should actually think of

412
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,159
what we're going to do

413
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,760
next thank you thank you yes mean so um

414
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:44,400
to just um highlight something that you

415
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:47,400
said that it it for you it's not

416
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,080
Palestinians versus Jews or Jews versus

417
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,159
Palestinians in in Israel and and RZA as

418
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,120
much as because Palestinians were killed

419
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,600
as well on October 7th and Palestinians

420
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,200
have been killed before and after

421
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,679
October 7 but it's the ideology of

422
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,200
violence that has been constant

423
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:13,480
basically killing um and the scale of of

424
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,240
the killing of course like um we will

425
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,679
talk numbers um uh later on in our

426
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,240
conversation but the scale of killing is

427
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:24,440
also very disproportionate however for

428
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,799
us as Physicians killing is a killing

429
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,400
and a life is a life and each life uh

430
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:33,360
matters Jewish Palestinian non-jewish

431
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,120
nonp Palestinian each life matters thank

432
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,159

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:41,240

and spoken extensively about the

447
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,880
surgical humanitarian work um the United

448
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,279
States role in the Israeli Palestinian

449
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,279
um um I'm going to use the word conflict

450
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,080
even though I prefer not to use the word

451
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:31,200
conflict but this is the summary I have

452
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,880
and the political consequences of

453
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,039
medical relief work he approaches the

454
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,840
Israeli Palestinian issue as a secular

455
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,520
American and as a

456
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,600
humanitarian um fuse welcome so can you

457
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,000
initially tell us about your path to

458
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,760
Medicine just because some of our

459
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,679
attendees um may not be in medicine and

460
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,520
it would be important for them to know

461
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,799
how did you make your way um and from

462
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,760
medicine and and surgery how did you

463
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,440
make your way to Palestine

464
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,200
uh actually it's it's the opposite way

465
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,960
around so I um I uh my my uh my freshman

466
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,880
year of college was 2000 and that's when

467
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,440
the second Ina broke out so I um I

468
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,559
started learning a lot about the Israel

469
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,000
Palestine conflict uh read a lot about

470
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,880
it I've edited some books on the topic

471
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,720
at this point and um in learning about

472
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,679
it uh and then you know of course the

473
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,000
next year uh September 11th happened in

474
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,960
the US and so that was a also a big

475
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,159
politicizing time so these were the like

476
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,880
the Middle East was a big focus of

477
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,200
political activity and just everything

478
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,520
that was going on in the whole country

479
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,960
and certainly on on my college campus at

480
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,799
Johns Hopkins

481
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,640
so uh so after you know I had gone to

482
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,880
med school thinking I would be a doctor

483
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,159
just because my dad's a doctor and that

484
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,240
was the only profession I knew that

485
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,960
existed um but uh afterwards I thought

486
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,480
well maybe uh maybe some something else

487
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,559
would be better I don't I you know again

488
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
I was a young guy didn't really know

489
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,400
what I was thinking but I thought maybe

490
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,159
something else so I said I'll let me let

491
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,600
me go live uh near this conflict that

492
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,200
I've seen uh I couldn't get a

493
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,799
volunteering position in the West Bank

494
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,840
but I could I did find one in Israel so

495
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,840
actually I lived in hia um I think you

496
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,480
said your mother's from hia right but

497
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,000
the um the uh so I lived in hia for a

498
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,480
year for people who don't know hia is

499
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,200
the only mixed Arab Jewish city um in

500
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Israel and um there are the the as you

501
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
can imagine the city government is

502
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,159
dominated by uh by Jewish Israelis and

503
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,320
there's a lot of uh kind of deliberate

504
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,120
harassment and and uh pinning down of

505
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,799
the Arab Community there

506
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,039
so uh so I worked with an Arab Jewish

507
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,559
Cooperative that just tried to solve

508
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:36,240
intercommunal problems in hia I mostly

509
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,919
just helped them communicate with the uh

510
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,360
with their funders at the EU um and this

511
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,159
doesn't exist anymore which tells you

512
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,880
how far to the right Israeli Society has

513
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,279
gone unfortunately but um uh but yeah so

514
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,360
while I was there I would tour around in

515
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,799
the West Bank um on the weekends

516
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,880
sometimes and I actually ended up at uh

517
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:55,799
uh in Hebron I I'm probably I'm pretty

518
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,799
sure I was at a hospital I just can't

519
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,159
remember but I ended up in Hebron and uh

520
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,840
and there was a Physicians for human

521
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,840
rights Israel delegation there um and uh

522
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,039
one of the guys there took me aside and

523
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,720
uh an an Israeli fellow Jewish Israeli

524
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,600
fellow and he took me aside and said you

525
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,200
know froze if you you said you want to

526
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,440
be a doctor but look at how these

527
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,799
Palestinian Doctors live you know they

528
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,559
don't get any special treatment from

529
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,880
anybody may maybe they have enough to

530
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,760
buy a used car from some settler but

531
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,559
they don't um they don't get any special

532
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,919
privileges they get beaten senseless at

533
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,080
checkpoints just like everybody else

534
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,720
they have to watch their children be

535
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,720
beaten not be arrested have you know

536
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,720
it's it's their life is just as cruel

537
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,720
and vicious as everybody else but they

538
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,240
still come to work and and still try to

539
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,600
help people and he said if you would do

540
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,960
that uh then be a doctor but otherwise

541
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,159
don't be a doctor and what he said made

542
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,480
an impact on me for sure because I I I

543
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:48,039
could see it but I hadn't been able to

544
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,720
articulate like what was wrong with this

545
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,200
picture why why aren't these people

546
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,600
privileged in any any way whatsoever

547
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,159
which You Could See Clearly um but at

548
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,919
the same time I thought to myself well

549
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm never going to be in that situation

550
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,799
I'm I'm the first world doctor in the

551
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,559
scenario not the third world doctor so

552
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:11,840
the um so I also took his um his

553
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,240
presence and his attitude because like

554
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,640
this guy could have sat in his living

555
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,039
room and criticized Israeli occupation

556
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,279
policy all he wanted and nobody would

557
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,000
have cared but by coming into the

558
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,559
territories he's putting himself at risk

559
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,760
not from the Palestinians but from his

560
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,600
own Society uh he's taking I'm sure he's

561
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,440
losing social bonds he's probably losing

562
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,880
money losing job opportunities losing

563
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,480
academic opportunities um because he's

564
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,640
going to be seen as a traiter his his

565
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,200
position of oh we should go um uh the

566
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,919
the POs you know just to show you how

567
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,440
extreme his position is in Israeli

568
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,919
Society after October 7th about a 100

569
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,159
Israeli Physicians signed a letter

570
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,360
calling on the Israeli uh Defense Forces

571
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,440
to destroy hospitals in Gaza that's

572
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,000
pretty wild that's that's pretty unusual

573
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,720
this this was mind buling

574
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,840
yeah well I wish I have to be honest I

575
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,640
wish it was mindboggling but um uh I'm

576
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,840
sure yes me and offline would testify

577
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,799
that it is not um the but no and I want

578
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
to be very clear Israeli Society is not

579
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,039
some monolith right I mean it's it's

580
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,960
true that peaceful Peaceable positions

581
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,360
are are a minority a very small minority

582
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,679
position but just to just to just so

583
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,919
nobody thinks we're being unfair the um

584
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,279
I I wrote a letter to the Biden

585
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,240
Administration that uh 98 other American

586
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,600
Healthcare professionals signed and in

587
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,559
that letter we called for an arms

588
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,600
embargo well 282 Israeli Physicians have

589
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,840
signed a letter endorsing our letter to

590
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,279
the Biden Administration they didn't

591
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,640
bother sending it to Netanyahu they just

592
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,440
sent it to Biden when he was still in

593
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,520
office excuse me sorry I'm nursing a

594
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,360
cough well that's that's probably

595
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,720
illegal for them to do it's it's illegal

596
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,360
to call for any uh that that it might be

597
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,240
considered treason under Israeli law to

598
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,600
call for an arms blockade on Israel so

599
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,919
uh you know that that's not a small

600
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,039
thing but again it's it's it would be

601
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,360
also unfair to pretend that that's some

602
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,080
you know that that is a very very very

603
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,440
small minority of even physicians in

604
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Israel but nevertheless it's there um

605
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,720
but anyway sorry so my path to Medicine

606
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,200
um I uh so yeah so then I uh after

607
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,520
living in Israel I came back I taught

608
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,919
Middle School in East Baltimore for a

609
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,240
year and then I went to went to med

610
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:19,279
school in in Texas um and uh yeah just

611
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,640
that's uh that's how that went so I

612
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,279
actually I actually decided to be a

613
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
doctor in the context of the Israel

614
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:27,279
Palestine conflict and that's why I uh

615
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,720
um continue to work there but I've I've

616
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,080
worked in plenty of other places as well

617
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,360
I've worked in Ukraine three times since

618
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,640
the Russian invasion that's where I got

619
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,240
this sh actually um and I've worked in

620
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,559
Haiti I've worked in Burkina Faso I

621
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,679
worked in southern Zimbabwe like I

622
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:44,240
mentioned I worked in the West Bank so

623
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,840
yeah yeah thank you so I've been to the

624
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,840
West Bank as I mentioned on medical

625
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,880
missions repeatedly and the um what is

626
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,679
most impressive I felt that the level of

627
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:59,600
um The Physician training and their

628
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:02,000
skills in medicine um was outstanding

629
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,919
like the physicians in in Palestine

630
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,919
could come and care for our children

631
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,760
here um in Boston and be on par with my

632
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,279
best colleagues and not only that they

633
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,760
can do even more so an orthopedic

634
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,039
surgeon can deliver a baby can evacuate

635
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,519
an intracranial bleed because of their

636
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,799
conditions and their limited resources

637
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,200
they tend to be very very skilled but

638
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,760
the resources are dire and the number of

639
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,279
Physicians per population is low um and

640
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,919
the Health Care System needs a lot of

641
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:39,279
support to even measure up to our basic

642
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,200
standard of care not even the standard

643
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,440
of care of Veterinary

644
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,799
Hospital how was the level of the Health

645
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,760
Care system in GZA you haven't been to

646
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:56,559
GZA before this latest attack on GZA

647
00:28:50,760 --> 00:29:00,159
right no so just to um put our listeners

648
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:03,360
into like the perspective of GDA GDA

649
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,480
strip is in the South um the population

650
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,399
in GDA over 70% of them are internally

651
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,720
displaced from other parts of Palestine

652
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,360
and they live in refugee camps in razza

653
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,279
in addition to the indigenous people of

654
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,600
razza it's very uh population dense uh

655
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:24,440
the population there is upward of 2.5

656
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:28,840
million people um in a neighborhood that

657
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:31,159
is really not not that large um and

658
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,440
they've been under siege and under

659
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:38,480
repeated military attack um for over 17

660
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,919
years right now this latest escalation

661
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,760
is a latest escalation but it's a it's a

662
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:48,519
chronic status of being under Warfare I

663
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,440
would say um I'm gonna also mention a

664
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:53,640
quick thing that I think you've heard

665
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,679
before um for a lot of people who are

666
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,000
involved with um with the Palestinian uh

667
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:05,360
humanitarian work the word conflict tend

668
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,039
to um uh be um less favored because it

669
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,519
gives the impression as if the sides are

670
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,039
equal and they're not even the word War

671
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,559
as if like there are two governments

672
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:18,399
with two military um uh you know um who

673
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,440
are like the belligerant and fighting

674
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,200
each other which is not the case so this

675
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,960
population has been under attack for a

676
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,480
while despite that they have as yasine

677
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,120
mentioned um many

678
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,600
hospitals you know a a Health Care

679
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:38,919
system that seemed to be working to some

680
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,960
extent and it seemed to be now decimated

681
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,320
but you were there on the ground can you

682
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,880
share with us fose what did you

683
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:50,480
see yeah so um just to add a little more

684
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,679
context actually the uh everything so so

685
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,360
the Gaza has been under siege literally

686
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,200
a military siege for 17 years like you

687
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,159
like you mentioned since uh since about

688
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,120
2005 when uh when the the uh when Hamas

689
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:07,480
won the Palestinian legislative council

690
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,320
elections and um during that time the

691
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,880
the US Israeli Egyptian blockade of Gaza

692
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,519
has reached truly extreme proportions

693
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,399
there's nothing like it that's ever been

694
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,360
done in outside of like medieval Siege

695
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,159
history it's really quite cruel Gaza is

696
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,399
a strip of land that is 25 mil long and

697
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,919
it's at its widest it's 6 mil wide so

698
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:29,080
it's the length of a marathon and the

699
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,679
width of a pretty quick jum jog it's not

700
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,679
large at all in it is two or in it used

701
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,960
to be 2.2 million people uh Gaza City

702
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,080
had a population density higher than

703
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,200
that than that of New York City and of

704
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,399
course without the height of its

705
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,600
buildings without its Municipal services

706
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,880
and the entire strip even including the

707
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,720
completely unpopulated uninhabitable

708
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,320
parts of it had the same population

709
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,639
density as Boston so this is a very

710
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,720
crowded place like you mentioned also

711
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:59,080
70% of the strip is refugees from the

712
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,519
1948 and some also from the 196 7 Wars

713
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,200
but also uh 50% of the stripp is

714
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,679
children uh the 51% of people are were

715
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,360
under under the age of 18 I think I

716
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:12,120
think it was 40% are under the age of 15

717
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,799
and 15% of PE of humans in Gaza are

718
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,120
under the age of five that it's a that's

719
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,639
extremely

720
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,320
unusual it's a very very young place um

721
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:24,240
and the The Siege has had some very

722
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,440
unusual characteristics in the mo for

723
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,159
the modern world uh you know in the 9s

724
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,200
when uh Gaza and the West Bank were

725
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,440
still still had some contact between

726
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,679
each other uh you could still move uh

727
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,679
gaza's main export was furniture that uh

728
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,120
people would would build um and then

729
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:43,000
mostly would export to the West Bank uh

730
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,200
that uh so there were 10 there were

731
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,080
often 10,000 trucks a day entering and

732
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,639
leaving Gaza um and that's when gaza's

733
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,880
population was about half of what it is

734
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:55,240
now today we're talking even even I'm

735
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,639
talking about before October 7th now the

736
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,919
the number of trucks that would enter

737
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:03,039
Gaza was somewhere between 4 and 800 per

738
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,519
day usually about 500 um to supply all

739
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,720
of the needs of this population this is

740
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:12,360
also a population that since uh uh 2005

741
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,440
has undergone I think I I can't even I

742
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,320
can't remember because there's so many

743
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,960
uh like y me mentioned the operations

744
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,799
that the Israelis I shouldn't say the

745
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,200
Israelis I that the US and Israel keep

746
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,000
carrying out against Gaza um there's

747
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,519
been something like 13 or 14 of them uh

748
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
just to tell you just to show you how

749
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,480
extreme these operations are just to

750
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,679
maybe illustrate one point of how

751
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,240
extreme these operations are every time

752
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:38,120
the with with all three of the biggest

753
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,760
operations that's uh castled in 2008 and

754
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,679
N protective Edge in 2014 and now this

755
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,200
one called swords of iron or some crazy

756
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:48,159
name um with all three of these

757
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,360
operations the Israelis have spent days

758
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,399
literally Days running tracked Vehicles

759
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,840
so tanks bulldozers whatever they could

760
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:57,279
find along the eastern and Northern edge

761
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,159
of the Gaza Strip because that's the

762
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,799
only part that has any agricultural land

763
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,519
in it because it's on the tip of the uh

764
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,600
the southern aquifer um it just

765
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,159
destroying the soil over and over just

766
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,000
compacting it compacting it compacting

767
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:12,240
it and eventually the B the bulldozer

768
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,560
drivers are getting bored and actually

769
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,200
carving stars of David into the land

770
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,480
that are visible on satellites there

771
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,639
this was just reported in the Washington

772
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,839
Post uh yesterday or the day before that

773
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,040
they've done this for the third time now

774
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,119
so this is the the quality and extent of

775
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,119
Destruction that's been done to Gaza

776
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,919
over and over and over again for the

777
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:36,520
past nearly two decades in a population

778
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,520
that has almost entirely grown up in

779
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,399
those two decades is just absolutely

780
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,040
unprecedented in any other part of the

781
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,760
world I honestly I think in human

782
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,040
history if somebody can provide me a

783
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,960
counter example I'd love to see it so

784
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,119
that so you you're like well I asked you

785
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,720
about the Health Care System why are you

786
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,159
talking about this healthc care is the

787
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,119
very top of what a society provides to

788
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,520
people in in the way I think of it and

789
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,640
you guys are academics so you can

790
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,560
probably correct me but the um healthc

791
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,560
care is up here food and sewage and

792
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,440
sanitation are down here right well when

793
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,400
I was in Gaza uh most of the Health Care

794
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,760
System had already been destroyed and

795
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,800
and that's the way it is now

796
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,240
unfortunately we we often talk about you

797
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,920
know if you look at The Who and the OCA

798
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:24,800
the the un uh OCA um updates you'll see

799
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,839
that there are 36 hospitals in Gaza

800
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,000
that's not really true there there are

801
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:31,359
36 building that are called hospitals

802
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,240
but most of them don't do acute medical

803
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,440
care they're maternity uh hospitals

804
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,240
they're important things don't get me

805
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,000
wrong but they're not actual acute care

806
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,000
hospitals they're not their maternity

807
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,079
hospitals their Rehabilitation

808
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,240
Facilities their pediatric specialist

809
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:50,240
things like that um and uh is a tertiary

810
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,760
orc Veterinary Hospital only only shifa

811
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,520
only shifa and even then it just

812
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,240
happened to be very large it didn't it

813
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,880
but you know it did have a cath lab it

814
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,119
did have a neuro Interventional lab it

815
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,880
did it did have lot of that shifa did

816
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,240
but shiffa and that's I'm glad you

817
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,800
brought it up shifa was really the only

818
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,359
place where you could do Advanced

819
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,880
tertiary and qu quinary care in Gaza not

820
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,440
only because of the physical plant of

821
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,119
the building just for maybe people don't

822
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,000
know shiffa Hospital yes me was it in

823
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,880
Gaza City or was

824
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,720
it where was shifa hospital I think Gaza

825
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,960
City I I think it's in Gaza City but

826
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,079
anyway shifa is a 700 something bed

827
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,200
hospital it would actually be the

828
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,119
seventh biggest Hospital in California

829
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,119
so it's a huge place

830
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,839
um uh especially for a PL a territory

831
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,160
that only has 2.2 million people in it

832
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:37,680
it's just enormous um all of the best

833
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,319
physicians all of the best surgeons all

834
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,560
of the most advanced uh modalities of

835
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,760
care um and the only Trauma Center were

836
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,280
were for the entire Gaza Strip were at

837
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,480
shifa hospital shifa was raided four

838
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,800
times and it's been completely destroyed

839
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,720
uh there were 3,400 hospital beds in

840
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,560
Gaza before October 7th which was

841
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,880
already way way too low that was at the

842
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,720
level of in Sudan um in terms of the

843
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,960
perp person hospital beds that were

844
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,359
available when shiffa was destroyed

845
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,960
which the final the Israel rid shiffa

846
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,079
Hospital four times and the last one

847
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:13,000
ended uh on March 30th or 31st when when

848
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,160
I was at a European Hospital in the

849
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
South um and so we actually got a large

850
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,760
influx of their staff and their patients

851
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,440
and things like that but um when shiffa

852
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,280
was finally destroyed 20% of healthc

853
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,480
care beds in Gaza were gone and all of

854
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,480
the advanced modalities of of caring GS

855
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,480
that were gone all of them cardiac

856
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,280
catheterization like just anything that

857
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,240
you would think of as as being in a

858
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,440
hospital gone that that's that that was

859
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,319
it uh so so that so like the top tier of

860
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,960
of healthc care was just bulldozed off

861
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:47,880
and it's gone it's not um and in

862
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,079
addition to that with the destruction of

863
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,119
shifa came the uh The Killing and

864
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,280
imprisonment of a huge amount of amount

865
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,200
of its staff and these were the staff

866
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,200
that were at the top of it so um the the

867
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,200
heads of departments the head uh you

868
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,760
know the the heads of nursing

869
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,760
departments the Physicians that head

870
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,400
that head departments etc etc um and so

871
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,280
the the the large mass of experience

872
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,400
that keeps any complex system like a

873
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,599
healthcare system going gone uh these

874
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,599
most of these people are still in

875
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,800
Israeli detention or or murdered or

876
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,720
killed or yeah and you know there there

877
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,119
was a particularly vicious example and

878
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,240
I'm ashamed that I can't remember their

879
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:31,839
names um uh but there there was a a a a

880
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,359
woman physician I I believe she was a

881
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,800
pediatrician and her son I believe was a

882
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:39,240
general surgeon they were found Bound in

883
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,119
machine gun to the together at when the

884
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,280
raid was over that's what you know it

885
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,839
just speaks to what the isra attack is

886
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,599
but anyway so when I was at and Dr hus

887
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,760
Abu safia for example he's well Dr H

888
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,040
ABIA was was that was that Kamal one

889
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,640
like yester mentioned um and uh you know

890
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,319
you know his example is kind of

891
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,960
interesting actually uh husam Abu safia

892
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:05,079
is a pediatrician and Kamal adwan from

893
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,880
what I understand was mostly a

894
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,520
children's hospital um that Kamal edwan

895
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,319
basically doesn't exist anymore but

896
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,400
husam Abu safia really built this

897
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:16,280
Hospital up himself he was the one who

898
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,480
established the Departments found

899
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,079
competent people to lead them you he

900
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,040
really he poured his life into this

901
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,119
Hospital uh the the hospital was laid

902
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,920
Siege to for three months by the

903
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,920
Israelis this is

904
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,119
after after detaining Abu sfia at the

905
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,240
beginning of again I I I totally agree

906
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,680
with you Aman that a war is not the

907
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,240
right way to describe whatever has

908
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,079
happened in the past uh 15 months but

909
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,119
just for the sake of using some

910
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,680
rhetorical device I'll call it a war at

911
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,800
the beginning of the war or the attack

912
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,200
um the uh Abu safia was detained and he

913
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,400
was let go you can't claim now now

914
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,920
they're going around saying he's the

915
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,720
Hamas Colonel that we've been looking

916
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,400
all sorts of utter nonsense think man

917
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,839
the guy's just pediatrician um Abu safia

918
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,680
during this this 3mon Siege he refused

919
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,960
to leave the hospital his uh son was

920
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,680
killed during during the siege of the

921
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,200
hospital his son was killed his son is

922
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,720
buried in the courtyard of the hospital

923
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,680
that he created he's wounded in his leg

924
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,280
so uh and then finally the Israelis

925
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,480
demand that he give himself up before

926
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,319
they just destroy the entire place so he

927
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,880
does because he figured he's he's hoping

928
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:27,839
that by doing so at least I think he's

929
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,960
hoping by doing so that he'll um spare

930
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,000
the uh spare the hospital the worst of

931
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,720
it even though it didn't um just with

932
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,560
dignity and Grace he walks with an

933
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,920
injured leg in his white coat up to an

934
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,880
Israeli tank and they open the door and

935
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,720
he gets in and no one has heard a word

936
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,240
from him since um and then his mother

937
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,920
has a heart attack the next day or the

938
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,800
day after and dies because she just

939
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,880
can't can't handle it anymore you know

940
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,240
everybody has a limit so his example

941
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,560
kind of it shows you know you they

942
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,319
they're taking this the the pal

943
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,520
intelligencia not just in healthcare but

944
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:03,560
in really every possible field you can

945
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,280
think of uh they're either driving them

946
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,480
out of Gaza or just arresting them and

947
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,160
killing them uh and then that's just

948
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,560
having this multigenerational effect

949
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,960
that you can see all the way down the

950
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,880
line and again in a place that is half

951
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,599
children if you take away the

952
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,400
intelligencia I mean what are you what

953
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,079
are you leaving there you know but

954
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,160
anyway the to answer the question you

955
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,240
actually asked me sorry the uh the

956
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,480
healthc care system in Gaza even when I

957
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,359
was there in March which was a

958
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,200
relatively good time especially where I

959
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,319
was in in conun uh was an utter disaster

960
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,560
the the hospital had about 220 beds uh

961
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:38,520
and there were 1,500 people admitted to

962
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,040
it there was another 1,500 people lining

963
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,680
the hallways of the hospital who just

964
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,800
lived in they just lived there because

965
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,359
they were the ones that were lucky

966
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,920
enough to think well if I go live in the

967
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,240
hallways of the hospital I don't have to

968
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,560
live outside um because all these

969
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,920
people's homes had been destroyed most

970
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,480
of them were displaced from the north

971
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,800
but others were displaced from conun

972
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,599
itself the grounds of the hospital was

973
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,040
itself a displaced person's camp we were

974
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,440
told 10 to 15,000 people were Sheltering

975
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,760
there they were sharing four toilets and

976
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,359
one water spigot from what I could find

977
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,359
um and uh like just to give one example

978
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,520
of how unb this is back this is a year

979
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:14,640
ago now but uh just to give one example

980
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,480
of how incredibly overwhelmed this

981
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,040
Health Care system was uh I did wound

982
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,160
care rounds the first three days that I

983
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,640
was there just to establish a wound care

984
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,280
service which was obviously quite

985
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,760
necessary given the U the the huge

986
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,119
amount of exposive injuries we were

987
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,319
seeing yeah and uh I found about 250

988
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,880
people in the hospital who needed daily

989
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,880
operative wound care so they really they

990
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,960
needed to be taken to the O put under

991
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,839
general anesthesia have their wound de

992
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,160
breeded extensively packed you know

993
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,720
whatever but some kind of operation not

994
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,520
a complex one like I could teach any

995
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,200
teenager to do it in about 30 minutes

996
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,800
but the um but nevertheless it needs

997
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,200
these resources there are 250 such

998
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,079
people there's four ORS at a European

999
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,640
Hospital how on Earth are you going to

1000
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,480
provide this service well I you know i i

1001
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,800
i innovated and I started and I probably

1002
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,160
shouldn't say this out loud but I

1003
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,839
started stealing ketamine from the

1004
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,160
anesthesia carts and doing this on the

1005
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,800
floor that's is my understanding yeah

1006
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,200
the medication limitation so the

1007
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,680
anesthetics were limited oxygen was

1008
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,680
limited antibiotics became you know

1009
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,440
unavailable so even if you do the

1010
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,040
procedure you know the risks that come

1011
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,160
after that and we're talking about

1012
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,400
injuries so similar to what you

1013
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,280
mentioned before yes mean like thinking

1014
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,839
at this from a public health perspective

1015
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,920
and the three of us are involved with

1016
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:32,559
public public health and humanitarian

1017
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:36,040
work the number of people who are dying

1018
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,839
from you know the attacks the the

1019
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,040
violent attacks is something and the

1020
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:44,119
number of people who are impacted by the

1021
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,520
starvation the infectious diseases the

1022
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,079
post-operative infections if they were

1023
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:53,640
lucky enough to have a procedure that

1024
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:56,640
all compounds the the cost the the human

1025
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:59,240
cost of what was happening in gizza what

1026
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,319
are your thoughts yes mean right so I I

1027
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,000
actually I wanted yeah I wanted to give

1028
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:06,520
some uh H context to this because also

1029
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,559
fro mentioned the The Siege on Gaza that

1030
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,520
started in 2007 uh because I think it's

1031
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,559
important to know the context um it

1032
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,640
didn't happen this like War didn't

1033
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:20,040
happen in a

1034
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,880
vacuum um and um fos was right to say

1035
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,800
you know the basic thing is sanitation

1036
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,319
and sewage system and actually back in

1037
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:34,240
2018 the already declared Gaza unlivable

1038
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,880
because of sanitary and um conditions uh

1039
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,800
and part of it is because of the siege

1040
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,119
so many people don't really know that

1041
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,559
one of the characteristics of The Siege

1042
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,920
meant that um the Israeli Army actually

1043
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,760
controlled all entrances uh and exits

1044
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,200
from uh from Gaza Strip except from

1045
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,760
rafah uh checkpoint which was um

1046
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,440
controlled by the Egyptians but since uh

1047
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,000
the the Egyptians and the Israeli Army

1048
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,599
are cooperating was basically the same

1049
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,240
and and part of it was um part of the

1050
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:08,079
restrictions was that anything that can

1051
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,240
be perceived as um uh that has potential

1052
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,119
for dual

1053
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,920
use um cannot be cannot be entered to uh

1054
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,599
to Gaza so dual use means everything

1055
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,599
that can be possible possibly used for

1056
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,680
like uh building um tunnels or bombs or

1057
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,880
whatever cannot be entered so what does

1058
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,760
that mean so all of like the the gases

1059
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,160
that we use for anesthesia

1060
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,160
medications because they're liquids that

1061
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,000
cannot be

1062
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,880
identified um electricity generators so

1063
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,200
all these things even just you know

1064
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,400
concrete because you can build um you

1065
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,400
can build tunnels with that so that I I

1066
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,000
hope explains why most of the hospitals

1067
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,200
there cannot be tertiary um Care Centers

1068
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
because you can you can't even uh get

1069
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,720
the supplies because they're all

1070
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,720
controlled by by thei thei military uh

1071
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,920
so that's one thing and then second

1072
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:06,200
thing again as fro mentioned is um

1073
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:09,559
um the the frequency of of military

1074
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:14,920
operations so almost once a year um

1075
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:17,240
these things happen um and every gazin

1076
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,920
physician that I've interviewed says we

1077
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,440
know that the first thing that happens

1078
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,160
that there are uh deliberate attacks

1079
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,040
against Healthcare and one of the things

1080
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:32,559
um just as an example is that during um

1081
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:35,480
May 2021 21 sorry um there was another

1082
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:38,880
operation that lasted I think two two

1083
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,800
weeks it was during covid and one the

1084
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,280
things that happened that the the only

1085
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,160
covid clinic and covid lab uh that you

1086
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,760
that um was used for the for all the

1087
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,599
Hospitals and Clinics in in Gaza was

1088
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,640
bombed um and the director was killed

1089
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:57,680
together with 12 uh family members uh

1090
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,400
and this impacted

1091
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,040
the the the care that

1092
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,839
gsin received in the following 6 to 12

1093
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:10,000
months uh where they couldn't get covid

1094
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:12,359
tests or vaccines um for about for about

1095
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,720
12 months and and in it increased the

1096
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:18,200
fatality rate um significantly so this

1097
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,640
all happened before October 7th so once

1098
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,760
October 7th happened and the and the War

1099
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,319
uh in Gaza started this was they already

1100
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,440
started from a like a from a deficit in

1101
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:31,480
a way and when you think of of healthare

1102
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,839
Public Health um I actually thought you

1103
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:37,240
know on on the Israeli side we used to

1104
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,680
treat like um soldiers in the first

1105
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,240
month who came with these bizarre

1106
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,319
infections because they they were you

1107
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,000
know using the water from Gaza Strip

1108
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,960
that are all like polluted and infected

1109
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,319
and this is without even speaking about

1110
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,119
you know all the poisonous uh uh things

1111
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,920
that you get in the ground just from the

1112
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,920
bombing which is something that we we

1113
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,240
know it's part of like it's natural it's

1114
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,599
like we talk about uh poisonous uh gases

1115
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:08,000
after after the fires in La for example

1116
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:11,800
um so all these things definitely impact

1117
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,680
um umth Public Health there and we we

1118
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,680
now just since the ceasefire we now

1119
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,720
start hearing about more and more bodies

1120
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,280
that are taken out under the rubble um

1121
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,319
that we weren't even aware of before uh

1122
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,520
the ceasefire so I'm I think that we'll

1123
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,559
see the the real consequences in the

1124
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,520
next coming months when there are

1125
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,240
actually evacuations of all the debris

1126
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,559
from the

1127
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,680
bombings my understanding when I first

1128
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:44,000
um started uh traveling on medical

1129
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:47,000
missions to the West Bank was that um

1130
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,200
the deficit in the West Bank was dark

1131
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,799
like compared to um going to the

1132
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:56,119
hospitals in haa and the hospitals in

1133
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:58,440
Jerusalem and compared to the US the

1134
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,520
hospitals on Israeli side are comparable

1135
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,960
to our best hospitals here in the US um

1136
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,559
and you just go through the border with

1137
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:10,720
the challenges of going through the

1138
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:14,200
checkpoints um um kendia and others um

1139
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,160
once you cross it's like Crossing into

1140
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,480
time as if you are in a movie or in a

1141
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:24,200
nightmare like the difference is just

1142
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,200
Stark and people don't know like when I

1143
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,040
explain to people especially when they

1144
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,880
say oh oh they were living fine there

1145
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,599
was peace there was peace on October 6th

1146
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,839
and October 5th

1147
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:38,240
Etc it it didn't look peaceful to me and

1148
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,680
while people look exactly the same like

1149
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,400
I can't tell the difference between

1150
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,400
someone who is Palestinian Israeli or

1151
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,240
Jewish Israeli or Palestinian in the

1152
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,640
West Bank or or um on the other uh side

1153
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:53,960
of the fence somehow that distinction is

1154
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:57,400
very um known in in for people who live

1155
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:03,520
there and the lives of those two are are

1156
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:07,960
not the same I wonder how can how can we

1157
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:10,520
um explain and transmit that information

1158
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,240
what you saw on the ground F what you

1159
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,680
know yes mean and you experience on the

1160
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,599
ground and from your your interviews how

1161
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,680
can we Elevate the level of knowledge of

1162
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,440
people who are here who haven't traveled

1163
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,839
there and the West Bank is in much

1164
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,319
better shape than gizza but it's not in

1165
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,359
a good shape at all

1166
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:33,319
so I'm just envisioning something that

1167
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:36,319
is more nightmarish at Baseline than the

1168
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:39,160
West Bank and right now it's even way

1169
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:42,680
worse how how can we make them believe

1170
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,680
that this is the situation on the

1171
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:49,160
ground well uh I I it's it's unfortunate

1172
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,720
because nobody likes history including

1173
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,920
me but I think you have to look at it um

1174
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,359
the the history is not complicated in in

1175
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:01,559
any significant way

1176
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:03,640
um you know the yeah just like like like

1177
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,839
like you mentioned what was or you kind

1178
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,599
of hinted at it what was Gaza on October

1179
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,960
6th right well again I don't have we

1180
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,920
don't have time to go through it in in

1181
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:16,359
detail but you're you're talking about a

1182
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,960
imprisoned child Refugee population

1183
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:22,520
subjected to massive bombing attack like

1184
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,319
yes me said almost every year uh two of

1185
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,119
which have been so severe that they've

1186
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,000
actually resulted in the landscape of

1187
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,760
the gaz's strip being changed like I

1188
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,520
mentioned uh a place where attacks on

1189
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,200
Healthcare were already completely

1190
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,960
normal before before October 7th it was

1191
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,200
it's true that it's been completely just

1192
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,559
turned up to 11 but it's it's was

1193
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,680
complet it was totally the norm before

1194
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:47,640
everybody fully understood that um and

1195
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,599
then it's I I just I I I try to

1196
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,520
emphasize to people what this blockade

1197
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:55,240
was Yas me did mention that the Israelis

1198
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,920
justify things in terms of dual use but

1199
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,119
it's actually a lot more sinister than

1200
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,720
that and it it's I don't mean to

1201
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:02,240
contradict you but it's there's a

1202
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,720
there's a far more extreme layer to it

1203
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,640
and this has been reported on in the

1204
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,200
American Press totally unimpeachable

1205
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,520
sources anybody who wants to look them

1206
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,359
up can do so um the yes exactly uh Erica

1207
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,000
I completely agree with you I just just

1208
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:17,280
said in the chat yeah so in um yes I

1209
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,920
mean you can probably correct me about

1210
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,240
the dates um but after I believe it was

1211
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,079
after um uh after operation or excuse me

1212
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,119
after the uh the Hamas election which

1213
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,720
you corrected me sorry I thought I

1214
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:30,119
thought it was too 2005 you said it was

1215
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,839
2007 but whenever it was whenever Hamas

1216
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,720
won the uh the Palestinian legislative

1217
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,319
council elections in the mid 2000s um

1218
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,720
the Israeli the US and Israel

1219
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,520
immediately imposed a Siege on Gaza and

1220
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,599
there was a very famous quote from a guy

1221
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,559
who used to be the uh the special

1222
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,319
adviser to Ariel Chiron who was the

1223
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,240
Prime Minister at the time uh his name

1224
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:50,760
was do Vice glass he was an American I

1225
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,839
think uh at least judging by his accent

1226
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,079
he um he's in a in a cabinet uh cabinet

1227
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,799
discussion he famously said our new

1228
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,599
policy is that we're going to put the

1229
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:03,599
Palestinians on a diet they'll get a lot

1230
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:05,920
thinner but they won't die and the

1231
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,799
important context of that is that when

1232
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,559
the uh when he said that apparently the

1233
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:10,520
entire Israeli cabinet erupted in

1234
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:13,400
laughter they thought it was the

1235
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,480
funniest thing they'd ever heard um so

1236
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,160
that that was the policy that he wasn't

1237
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,480
joking um the uh and unfor you to be

1238
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,440
fair a lot of them did die but the uh

1239
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,760
but that that was the policy so the

1240
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,920
Israeli government went to the

1241
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,839
meticulous degree and people should

1242
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,440
think about what this means it went to

1243
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:34,480
the meticulous degree of calculating how

1244
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,640
many calories does a gauen person need

1245
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,839
to survive and then allowing

1246
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,559
specifically that many calories into

1247
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:45,640
Gaza every single day that why on Earth

1248
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,440
does Israel have the power to do that to

1249
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,040
an entire population just imagine if you

1250
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,920
if that's how you lived would you accept

1251
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,520
that for your children would you nobody

1252
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,160
would this is outrageous you no no no

1253
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,640
one on Earth would accept this I mean

1254
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,680
Jews in the wars saww ghetto didn't

1255
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,880
accept it why would they it's it's

1256
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,599
outrageous it's totally outlandish you

1257
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,480
know Palestinians and the Gaza GTO

1258
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,839
weren't going to accept it either and

1259
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:13,160
the the the cruelty of this policy just

1260
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:15,440
escalated and escalated and escalated

1261
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,680
and escalated and escalated um and

1262
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,839
incidentally just people can challenge

1263
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,920
me if they think I'm wrong it tended to

1264
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,680
escalate when Hamas became more

1265
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,599
reasonable not when they became more

1266
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,559
violent that actually went the other way

1267
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,400
when they became more violent so the um

1268
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,440
so yeah so there there's a long history

1269
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,680
there for sure and it's it's quite

1270
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,119
extreme yeah and I will say I I just

1271
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,680
want to add that one of the two

1272
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:40,240
arguments that we hear so one argument

1273
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,079
that we hear recently is that you know

1274
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,359
we've tried a Palestinian state it was

1275
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,760
Gaza look what happened so I think that

1276
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:48,359
what for is mentioning is just a good

1277
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,880
example that what if you don't really

1278
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:53,480
have control on transfer of like food

1279
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,559
medication just freedom of movement then

1280
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,760
you obviously don't have sovereignty so

1281
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,160
that's definitely not not an example of

1282
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,559
like a Palestinian state that failed

1283
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,640
that one thing and then the second thing

1284
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:05,200
that I will say especially about the

1285
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,119
attacks on healthare is that one of the

1286
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,839
arguments that we we hear is that you

1287
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:14,359
know it can it it is Justified because

1288
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:16,400
there were um hostages um hidden there

1289
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:19,319
so on a personal note I have to say I

1290
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,000
have friends who were hostages uh and

1291
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:24,359
were murdered um and colleagues who were

1292
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,160
murdered uh on let's say the Israeli

1293
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:28,440
side I had to I hate to do this division

1294
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,920
uh and I still don't think it is

1295
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,760
Justified to to attack a hospital

1296
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,400
because of that just imagine that you

1297
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,119
know I work now at Beth Israel as you

1298
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:40,400
mentioned imagine that I don't know a

1299
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:44,720
terrorist organization is having a

1300
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:48,960
hostage um situation in the hospital no

1301
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:52,559
one would even even think of uh bombing

1302
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:55,640
with a bomb of like one ton uh of

1303
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,000
explosives um bombing the the hospital

1304
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:01,359
it it would be

1305
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,880
unacceptable to anyone um but I don't

1306
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:06,039
understand why in it is it is acceptable

1307
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:10,240
and it is Justified I think that's a

1308
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:13,680
that's a it should be uh an unacceptable

1309
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:16,039
argument and as uh you know as a medical

1310
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,119
community as an academic Community as a

1311
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:20,119
you know human Community we should

1312
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,599
definitely condemn this and make sure

1313
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:25,200
that this does not happen

1314
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:28,359
again mean I'm sorry about your friends

1315
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,119
that you lost and the family members and

1316
00:56:28,359 --> 00:56:34,880
and people from from the south so I

1317
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:37,480
think um yes it goes without saying but

1318
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,000
I'm GNA say it every life matters like

1319
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,960
this is our oath as Physicians every

1320
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,319
life matters um I mourn the Jewish life

1321
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,960
that was lost but I mourn the

1322
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:52,039
Palestinian life equally the issue I

1323
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:55,280
think we've been encountering over the

1324
00:56:52,039 --> 00:57:00,039
past 16 months is that somehow the

1325
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:04,440
Palestinian life is discounted and it's

1326
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:07,880
worth dispensing with 40,000 or more of

1327
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:11,240
Palestinian lives because of what

1328
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:15,039
happened sorry out the last count

1329
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:18,720
61,000 61,000 I think the count is more

1330
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:23,079
I think right now um during this semi

1331
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,520
ceasefire um and once the UN and other

1332
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:28,119
uh humanitarian organization can do more

1333
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:32,319
work uh think the numbers will be will

1334
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:35,440
be different um so I'm at Harvard and um

1335
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:38,960
the late poor Paul Farmer used to say um

1336
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,760
the idea that some lives matter less is

1337
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,880
the root of all that is wrong with the

1338
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,880
world and I think one of the challenges

1339
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,200
for me as a physician and as a

1340
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:52,319
Palestinian is that specific thing like

1341
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:55,240
Palestinian lives should matter Jewish

1342
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,720
life does matter and Palestinian life

1343
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,039
should matter

1344
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:03,640
um and that is part of what is missing

1345
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:06,920
um from um a lot of the reporting that

1346
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,960
comes out we're mentioned in numbers

1347
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,440
like

1348
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:16,280
61,000 versus you know the names of the

1349
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:18,319
people each one was a life of its own um

1350
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,760
which is really which is really part of

1351
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:23,079
the dehumanization that's happening to

1352
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:27,640
the Palestinian in our Western

1353
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:30,400
media um one thing I want to ask you

1354
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,200
um you're an Israeli a Palestinian

1355
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,119
Israeli I prefer the term a Palestinian

1356
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,440
Israeli than Arab Israeli because we're

1357
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:39,839
a very specific population like we don't

1358
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:42,000
say you know um Latino America like we

1359
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:44,880
say you know someone from Puerto Rico

1360
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,240
someone from Cuba so you are a

1361
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:51,200
Palestinian

1362
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:54,160
Israeli um how how has it been for you

1363
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:58,119
over the past year speaking up for the

1364
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,960
humanity of Palestinians GZA um as an

1365
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:04,640
Israeli knowing that some of your

1366
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:08,880
colleagues um back home um have lost

1367
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:11,160
jobs over this yeah it is extremely

1368
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,799
challenging uh more challenging than I

1369
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,799
would have thought because I I expect

1370
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,880
the at least you know my colleagues like

1371
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:20,920
the medical and healthc Care Community

1372
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,599
to understand that every life is sacred

1373
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,240
as you just said and I was um

1374
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,920
disappointed and and uh surprised to

1375
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,039
learn that it wasn't as obvious uh as it

1376
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,680
is to me uh and yes many many of my

1377
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:36,920
colleagues who said that actually lost

1378
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:41,960
their jobs uh I still think that at this

1379
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:45,799
moment in time it is Our obligation to

1380
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:48,240
um to say that and speak out uh about

1381
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:51,599
the sac the the fact that every human

1382
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:56,559
life is sacred and that we must stop all

1383
00:59:51,599 --> 01:00:00,119
violence and we must um as you said

1384
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,319
um advocate for Palestinian lives and

1385
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:07,319
how and that they they they do matter

1386
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:09,960
just as much as any other lives um and

1387
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:12,960
uh I have to say like on I I do want to

1388
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:16,559
end on a hopeful note that there are

1389
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,440
some um Jewish colleagues Jewish Israeli

1390
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:22,960
colleagues many of them who share our

1391
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,480
Vol our values and also speak out uh

1392
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,079
against this and especially I have to

1393
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,280
say in the last day after like the

1394
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:34,079
president Trump said talked about you

1395
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:36,720
know uh the another Force displacement

1396
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:40,119
of the 2 million gazans

1397
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:43,799
to other countries and that maybe the

1398
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:47,480
United States will own the Gaza Strip um

1399
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:50,799
um many many many speak against it and

1400
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:53,400
and and plan the resistance this is our

1401
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:55,720
time we have to resist this so even

1402
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:59,200
though it is challenging uh and even

1403
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:02,839
though it um it Demands a lot of Courage

1404
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:05,000
I still think that as a Palestinian as

1405
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:06,720
an Israeli citizen but as you know the

1406
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,720
citizen of the world the human being it

1407
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,440
is my

1408
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:12,920
obligation to to resist what is

1409
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:16,760
happening now and do whatever I can to

1410
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:19,839
actually promote peace and um and shared

1411
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,760
humanity and Society in the

1412
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:26,200
region thank you so much yine and thank

1413
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:29,760
you fuse and this is an excellent point

1414
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:32,240
um to now um from it to start taking

1415
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,119
some questions from the audience so one

1416
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:38,119
of the questions that came um is asking

1417
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,480
about housing uh giving the area size of

1418
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,920
Gazza could there be or are there

1419
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,839
immediate efforts to engage housing

1420
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,119
systems that could nurture Health

1421
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:50,760
efforts and food uh security um they

1422
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:53,160
mentioned so many Technologies uh and or

1423
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,000
designs that allow for Off the Grid

1424
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,680
alternative dwelling energy gardening

1425
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,680
efforts um these are all necessary for

1426
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:05,319
health and wellness I agree with you

1427
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,319
Ryan what do you think fuse and

1428
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:12,319
Y um so obviously I mean housing is the

1429
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,319
as we mentioned it's like the one of the

1430
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:19,079
most basic things um that we're

1431
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:21,119
um we're now facing when we even just

1432
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:26,079
discussing Rec construction of and

1433
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:28,599
rebuilding of Gaza um I think so my my

1434
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:33,400
rule of thumb uh at least you know

1435
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:37,319
thinking of the future is that um anyone

1436
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:41,079
who can fund a bomb or like an airplane

1437
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:43,760
who bombs people can fund clinics and

1438
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:46,400
housing and and you know rebuilding

1439
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,279
sewage systems and stuff like that so I

1440
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,039
and I not at the same time

1441
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:53,599
right one of the yeah yeah yeah yeah I

1442
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:56,319
mean I don't it it shouldn't be at the

1443
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,799
same time you shouldn't fund what we

1444
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,480
have done which we which we what we have

1445
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:02,960
done as Americans like we sent

1446
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,520
humanitarian Aid and at the same time we

1447
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:09,400
kept sending the bombs and um that is

1448
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:12,000
just hypocritical absolutely absolutely

1449
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:14,680
but but if you have the nerve to to pay

1450
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
for bombs at least have the decency to

1451
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:20,799
pay for you know housing and and and uh

1452
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,039
clinics and and hospitals and

1453
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:26,599
education um and that's what I expect

1454
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:30,920
from from the global community uh from

1455
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:34,200
us as you know as um just you know

1456
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,799
humans uh and and yes we have we we are

1457
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,400
so good at developing Technologies to

1458
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:41,119
kill other people everyone is talking

1459
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,680
about AI today we also there there were

1460
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:46,240
a few like Publications about how AI was

1461
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,880
used actually to kill people in Gaza and

1462
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,920
Lebanon and the West Bank in the past 15

1463
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:54,640
months we we should leverage these

1464
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,039
Technologies for better public health

1465
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,799
and and and better education and to

1466
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,680
actually uh rebuild Gaza from a a place

1467
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:05,279
of

1468
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:07,279
trust um uh and and and invest there as

1469
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:08,480
a you know as a global Community that's

1470
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:11,880
how I see

1471
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:15,599
it thank you yes peruse you mentioned

1472
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:18,480
human rights um at what at one point I

1473
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,960
will um I will say that this past

1474
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,760
December uh on the 10th marked 76 years

1475
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,279
since the adoption of the universal

1476
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:29,160
Declaration of Human Rights and you're

1477
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:31,960
right security and shelter precede water

1478
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:34,400
and water precede food and food precedes

1479
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,559
Health but health is one of them so one

1480
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,680
of the questions comes um asking what

1481
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,880
are the sectors you think are most

1482
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:46,119
needed right now in healthare after we

1483
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:49,200
establish the the immediate need of

1484
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:52,680
security shelter food and

1485
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:54,720
water um honestly I would say uh you

1486
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,319
know trauma care but then also obstetric

1487
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,119
and Pediatric Care I think would be

1488
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:00,920
probably the most uh the most important

1489
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:03,920
things to focus on

1490
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:07,559
yeah yes mean what do you

1491
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:10,160
think I mean I think it I I agree with

1492
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:12,200
fro and he has more experience in uh in

1493
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,359
this than me because he was there uh but

1494
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,880
at least from what I've heard from uh

1495
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:20,960
from other Physicians it seems like

1496
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:24,920
everything is in you know severe um um

1497
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:28,440
shortage so uh um all the all the basic

1498
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,960
needs you Primary Care pediatricians um

1499
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,720
um

1500
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,240
Obstetricians um we don't talk about

1501
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:38,079
mental health because this is in a way

1502
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:41,359
um maybe higher on the mlo uh pyramid

1503
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:43,960
but yeah it's like a luxury yeah yes but

1504
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:46,599
but no it's not it's not luxury I we

1505
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:50,079
need to remember that um on the average

1506
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:53,119
a person in Gaza lost about 30 family

1507
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:56,359
members um what does that what does that

1508
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,920
do to your you know to your Soul mental

1509
01:05:56,359 --> 01:06:00,559
health um right and everyone is

1510
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,559
traumatized everyone is traumatized

1511
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,200
everywhere right but uh we have to keep

1512
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:08,400
that in mind as

1513
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:11,359
well thank you uh thank you y and fuse

1514
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,920
zaren is asking um and it's great to see

1515
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:17,760
you here Zan um she's asking that um if

1516
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:21,599
she cannot physically uh go on medical

1517
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,720
Mission as a physician here in in the US

1518
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:27,559
how can she support the healthc care

1519
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,559
sector in gizza and the West Bank

1520
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,760
mental health would be one way right

1521
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:37,400
like if we can get electricity up and

1522
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:40,520
running um and have internet could we

1523
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:43,279
have um mental health um appointments

1524
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,279
with Physicians

1525
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:51,160
here yeah I believe I think so first I

1526
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,880
know of like a specific um um Venture

1527
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:56,680
it's in the West Bank but it's like

1528
01:06:52,880 --> 01:07:00,520
digital way to uh give like deliver

1529
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:02,480
mental health um um you know treatments

1530
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,559
uh in Arabic or in English I want to say

1531
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,920
like the Palestinians both in the West

1532
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,520
Bank and Gaza and that's evidence-based

1533
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,559
are the the most educated out of the

1534
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:15,680
Arab world they most of them know

1535
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:17,599
English so this can definitely uh help

1536
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,640
um I also want to say I think that's a

1537
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,760
good opportunity to speak what we

1538
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:24,640
happened um I think it was last week

1539
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,680
where uh two Palestinian patients were

1540
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,400
uh supposed to speak speak I think at

1541
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,880
Harvard and I feel comfortable saying it

1542
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,880
as Harvard faculty uh and it was uh

1543
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,039
cancelled so I think that's another

1544
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,480
thing that we can do as uh you know as

1545
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:41,440
as Physicians here uh there are

1546
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:44,079
Palestinians here uh from Gaza who um

1547
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,440
left uh ran away from you know from the

1548
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,799
bombs looking from for Better Lives and

1549
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,720
many of them are you know sick or

1550
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:53,720
patients and they can be uh supported

1551
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,799
here as well uh and we just need to you

1552
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,680
know let them let them speak about their

1553
01:07:55,799 --> 01:08:00,640
experiences and not cancel them just

1554
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:03,039
because it's I don't know

1555
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,640
unbalanced thank you yes I can speak

1556
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:09,520
actually a bit uh to that experience so

1557
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:12,440
I'm the organizer of that lecture um at

1558
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,559
uh at the medical school and um uh

1559
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:18,920
complaints came over the weekend about

1560
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:21,640
the event uh from uh people who I feel

1561
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:24,040
um out of out of empathy I would say the

1562
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:27,480
word Palestinian patients from Gaza is a

1563
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:31,400
trigger for them without understanding

1564
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:34,839
um how the event will happen so um it

1565
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:37,239
wasn't canceled as much as it was paused

1566
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:40,359
to explore what it is and to have all

1567
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:43,080
the facts so once the dean have all the

1568
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:44,839
facts he's actually approved reinstating

1569
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,960
uh the patient sessions Thea patient

1570
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:50,719
sessions and the lectures so um it's

1571
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:54,120
actually um a success story in which you

1572
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:57,159
know um reason and Common Sense and

1573
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:59,520
speaking directly um to people who are

1574
01:08:57,159 --> 01:09:02,000
making decisions and making the argument

1575
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:05,640
Works um so there you go that's

1576
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,520
wonderful way of yeah and I think there

1577
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,359
were also about 200 discrimination

1578
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,000
complaints filed again about this right

1579
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,520
like there it was there were hundreds of

1580
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,839
complaints filed at least that's what

1581
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,719
the Boston papers reported this morning

1582
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:20,719
Boston Globe said um just because I know

1583
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:23,640
the inside of that story The lectures

1584
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:26,640
were approved before the knowledge about

1585
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:29,359
the complaints um good I think there is

1586
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:32,040
um and one of the questioners brought up

1587
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:35,120
the issue of pervasive anti-palestinian

1588
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:37,480
racism in the US that is a true

1589
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,920
statement we do have pervasive

1590
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:43,000
anti-palestinian racism and we do have

1591
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,719
censorship and silencing um it's not

1592
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,920
happening in this instance because um

1593
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:51,679
they were approved to to um to be

1594
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:54,239
reinstated however um permission to

1595
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:57,400
narrate was an article that Edward S

1596
01:09:54,239 --> 01:10:00,159
wrote um that decades ago and I think I

1597
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:02,880
agree wholeheartedly with you and with

1598
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:05,880
fuse uh we need to speak up we need to

1599
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,320
shed light on the facts on the ground

1600
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:11,040
and um we need to elevate the humanity

1601
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:13,800
of Palestinians Palestinians are humans

1602
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,199
um and they deserve equal attention

1603
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,679
equal Humanity equal right just like any

1604
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:22,320
other people not more and but not less

1605
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:26,199
definitely not less um one of the

1606
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:29,400
questions that also came is um where uh

1607
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:31,320
would people find um accurate resources

1608
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,880
to learn about the situation on the

1609
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,880
ground uh from a medical

1610
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,880
standpoint the health

1611
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,440
clusters yeah the the the UN The Who

1612
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,520
Health clusters um the there's there's

1613
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,520
plenty of resources online uh from

1614
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,920
people on the

1615
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:54,120
ground I will just say because I don't

1616
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:57,480
know will probably not say but um he has

1617
01:10:54,120 --> 01:11:01,719
a wonderful in the New York Times that

1618
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:03,560
gives uh some um Testaments from

1619
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:06,760
Physicians who worked in

1620
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:09,679
Gaza uh and it's a it's

1621
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:13,920
a it's really it really is a painful

1622
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,920
read but I think it's very very

1623
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:22,280
important thank you thank you for

1624
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:25,000
writing it h f no me too yep um one of

1625
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,120
the questions that also came is um as

1626
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,880
you

1627
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:33,840
citizens um how can we advocate for

1628
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,840
Palestinians and what's happening in in

1629
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:41,360
Gaza so people who are not in

1630
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:43,159
healthcare yeah I mean I I think uh

1631
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:45,719
people in or out of healthcare should

1632
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:47,239
just recognize the I I try to emphasize

1633
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:49,360
it all the time there there was no

1634
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:51,600
Israeli attack on Gaza there was a US

1635
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,639
Israeli attack on Gaza that's been going

1636
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,719
on for the past like we said 17 years um

1637
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:59,440
everything the US and Israel are Israel

1638
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,400
has been described I think accurately as

1639
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,040
an offshore as a stationary American

1640
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:06,199
aircraft carrier in the Middle East uh

1641
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:08,080
there's a there there's a lot of

1642
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:09,400
cooperation that the two military

1643
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,080
systems are very very tightly

1644
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,719
coordinated so you just have to

1645
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:15,560
recognize that we are the ones that

1646
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,480
committed these crimes that's it as soon

1647
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,760
as you recognize that you you it's

1648
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,239
pretty obvious what you should be doing

1649
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,760
you should be trying to stop them um you

1650
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,800
know how you don't like if you go set

1651
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,239
your neighbor's house on fire you can't

1652
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,480
walk back to your house and say yeah I

1653
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,080
don't really care what happens when my

1654
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,679
neighbor's house catches fire it's like

1655
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,000
no you you're the one that set it on

1656
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,639
fire if you commit a crime you're

1657
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,960
responsible for the consequences of that

1658
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:38,760
crime and and mitigating them and paying

1659
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,840
people reparations for them etc etc it's

1660
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,719
not it's not complicated how to how that

1661
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:44,480
has to happen but that requires

1662
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,040
political organization it requires

1663
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,120
talking to people and it requires taking

1664
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,960
some

1665
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:52,679
risks talking to our politicians voting

1666
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:55,960
the right politicians in that look at

1667
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:57,520
humans as humans abs creating or

1668
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,920
creating new political systems whatever

1669
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,040
it might be I don't know that's up to

1670
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:04,320
everybody else to decide I I couldn't

1671
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:08,360
claim expertise in that but

1672
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:12,600
yeah thank you um that question comes

1673
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:15,679
back to you yes mik m is asking um what

1674
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:18,760
do you think Israeli uh Jewish and

1675
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:20,760
Palestinian Physicians can do to make a

1676
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,560
difference that's a that's a wonderful

1677
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:24,800
question and I and I love it because I

1678
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:28,560
think we always have a choice we we can

1679
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,600
choose choose to sign a a petition or a

1680
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,360
letter that says it's okay to bomb a

1681
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:36,560
hospital or we can choose to actually um

1682
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,560
um cooperate with our colleagues um uh

1683
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,639
Palestinians and Israelis and I have to

1684
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:43,520
say actually in the past two years I was

1685
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:47,239
working with uh two other uh colleagues

1686
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:49,600
researchers on a research um qualitative

1687
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:52,280
research and we studied Healthcare

1688
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,719
initiatives that are joint uh Israeli

1689
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,120
and Palestinians cross border or cross

1690
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,199
culture

1691
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:00,239
um some of them were you know Israelis

1692
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:01,960
and Palestines from Gaza some in

1693
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:05,080
Jerusalem some in West Bank and some

1694
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:07,760
inside Israel and we actually showed

1695
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:09,920
that um we looked at three metrics so

1696
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,159
equality and participation and in

1697
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,159
management in decision making um int

1698
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:17,600
intensity how intense the interaction is

1699
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:21,080
and intentionality how intentional the

1700
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:25,840
programming is in in terms of like um

1701
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:28,840
building trust and speaking about um

1702
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,960
the traumas the the narratives the pain

1703
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,239
and stuff like that and we show that all

1704
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:37,280
these three are are associated with uh

1705
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:39,480
building trust and I think that um

1706
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,040
Healthcare the reason we chose health

1707
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:44,639
care and health and Medicine in general

1708
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:46,719
is because this is kind of like in a way

1709
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:49,600
a a a profession in

1710
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:52,920
consensus uh in which we actually see on

1711
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:55,360
a daily basis Israelis and Palestinians

1712
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:59,000
interact and collaborate

1713
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:00,840
um because of you know the hypocritic G

1714
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
and because we really uh the the

1715
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:06,239
consensuses that we need we're here to

1716
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:10,000
save lives no matter who our patients

1717
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:13,080
are um and and this is a profession that

1718
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,560
is based on trust uh we are trained on

1719
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,679
how to deliver you know difficult

1720
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,880
conversations and and we we're trained

1721
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:21,120
on how to build Report with our patients

1722
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,880
and we see that so I see that on a daily

1723
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:26,639
basis that a Palestinian can treat

1724
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:29,679
Jewish uh patience and vice versa and

1725
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:34,440
and and they trust each other um so I do

1726
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:37,760
think that um I or at least I expect my

1727
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,880
Israeli Jewish uh colleagues to First

1728
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,639
understand the power dynamics and how

1729
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:45,000
like and their privilege and actually

1730
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:49,040
leverage it to support their Palestinian

1731
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,040
colleagues create more crossb

1732
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:55,600
collaborations in you know training um

1733
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:59,080
Healthcare um staff uh delivering more

1734
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:01,239
equipment and medication uh advocate for

1735
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:04,560
Palestinian Physicians and specifically

1736
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:07,560
Palestinian patients uh and advocate for

1737
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,120
for a better access to healthcare um

1738
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,480
this this way we can actually build

1739
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:14,800
Bridges toward hopefully some kind of

1740
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:18,320
like a a solution that can scale up

1741
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:22,360
Beyond Healthcare um um and I really

1742
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,360
believe that this is it this has a great

1743
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:29,120
potential I fully agree thank you thank

1744
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:32,120
you so much yine thank you so um Ryan

1745
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:34,239
here brings another uh comment um he's

1746
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,040
saying just talking about this speaking

1747
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:39,639
for the past hour and and 17 minutes has

1748
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,800
been cathartic and therapeutic exercise

1749
01:16:39,639 --> 01:16:45,239
are there any International Zoom groups

1750
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:47,560
to connect um victims of war in Gazza to

1751
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:50,120
people who want to listen to them who

1752
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:53,360
can just talk like the traditional pin

1753
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:58,520
pal concept a weekly or monthly effort

1754
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,520
um uh to share hope pain dreams

1755
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:06,719
Etc I know a lot of us have been glued

1756
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:08,679
yeah glued to the Instagram and Facebook

1757
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,600
and we follow stories and follow

1758
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:12,800
journalists from the ground but tell me

1759
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:15,040
Fus no I was going to say there probably

1760
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,159
are but I I don't honestly know where

1761
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:21,320
they are or or how to how to find them

1762
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:24,480
but uh um yeah yeah so I don't know

1763
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:25,520
necessarily of like Zoom groups yeah um

1764
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,239
but

1765
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:32,239
um there are definitely like people uh

1766
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:35,719
posting stuff on social media um there

1767
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:38,199
is a great podcast called Unapologetic

1768
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:40,560
then the third narrative that uh is done

1769
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:42,360
by two Palestinian citizens of Israel

1770
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,920
one is from East Jerusalem actually so

1771
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:50,320
not gsin um but there again there are

1772
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,880
like Palestinian communities um in US

1773
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:55,360
cities Iman maybe also can speak about

1774
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:59,040
this but we have some uh Palestinian

1775
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:02,159
Community here in Boston um that has

1776
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:04,400
events um and there are events in

1777
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:06,920
different universities I think maybe

1778
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,760
just getting more into these circles uh

1779
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,480
will get you exposed I guess to

1780
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:13,600
Palestinian

1781
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:16,400
stories yeah there is in Boston and I

1782
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:19,040
think in many cities the uh the annual

1783
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,639
film festival and that was actually an

1784
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,280
entry for me to learn about the

1785
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:25,280
Palestinian community in Boston when I

1786
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:27,360
first came in and got to know a lot of

1787
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,639
people through the film festival and we

1788
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,760
end up building actually communities uh

1789
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:35,520
locally in um in Newton in Boston of

1790
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:37,639
people who would like to to discuss uh

1791
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,400
the Palestinian issue one suggestion I

1792
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:43,199
will have I'm a book lover and a vicious

1793
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:45,000
leader uh reader you can um you can

1794
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:48,679
start a book club and read different

1795
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,679
books about Palestine and um and educate

1796
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:54,040
um yourself and the community around you

1797
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:56,480
and that will keep the conversation

1798
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,800
going I would say the the book um we

1799
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:02,560
reviewed most recently is a book I would

1800
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:06,600
highly recommend it's a 2024 Pulitzer

1801
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:10,080
Prize winner uh by Nathan thr uh it's

1802

titled A Day in the Life of Abid Salama

1803
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:17,040
and um the book is about a school bus um

1804
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:20,600
that um end up um getting set on fire by

1805
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:23,679
um hitting another trailer and um six

1806
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:27,040
people end up dying uh of burns um and

1807
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:30,440
it talks about all these like circles

1808
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:32,800
structural circles that contributed to

1809
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:35,639
eventually the death of the four kids

1810
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,080
you could say the fault was the driver

1811
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:40,840
of the trailer but it turns out that the

1812
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:43,120
fault is a whole structure that made

1813
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,239
that road that made Access to Health

1814
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,560
Care harder that made the access of the

1815
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:49,800
parents to their kids in these hospitals

1816
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,639
harder and it talks about the bigger

1817
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:54,760
picture of occupation which actually

1818
01:19:52,639 --> 01:19:57,159
gets into we're all involved in public

1819
01:19:54,760 --> 01:20:00,040
Health the public health Parable couple

1820
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:02,280
of years ago I think there was um a post

1821
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,120
about Physicians needing to stay in

1822
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,920
their Lane and stop talking about gun

1823
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:09,880
violence but it is our lane we don't

1824
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:11,840
want to be in politics but we are

1825
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:15,120
Physicians and the parable in public

1826
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,400
health is if you're seeing someone dying

1827
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,239
and you resuscitate them drowning in a

1828
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,520
river and you resuscitate the first the

1829
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:24,239
second the third at one point you need

1830
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,760
to go upstream and see what's causing

1831
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:28,880
all the these drowning incidents you'll

1832
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:32,000
find a broken bridge and you need to fix

1833
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:34,800
the bridge and I think it's part of our

1834
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,080
hypocritic oath to look Upstream while

1835
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:42,440
treating the patients and figure out how

1836
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,440
how to to basically fix the

1837
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:47,199
bridge excellent I'm wondering if there

1838
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:49,760
are any other questions one of the

1839
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:52,239
questions that uh someone posted it's a

1840
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,800
bit provocative but I think it's

1841
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:58,760
worthwhile um

1842
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:02,440
I I accept that question uh it says um

1843
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,679
why should a US citizen care about GZA

1844
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,880
or its

1845
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,719
healthare in in the same vein I would

1846
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:09,760
say I've heard it from so many people

1847
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:12,600
there are so many wars in the world why

1848
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,480
should we only single out

1849
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,800
resta I don't think we should only

1850
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,679
single out Gaza but um it's exactly what

1851
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,280
I said before you should care because

1852
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:24,199
you're the one that smashed

1853
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,880
it I I can't I can't walk into my

1854
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:28,560
neighbor my response yeah I can't walk

1855
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,480
into my neighbor's house and set it on

1856
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,000
fire and say h i don't care what happens

1857
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,080
in my neighbor's house if you want to

1858
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,159
say you don't care about what happens in

1859
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,840
other countries we have our own problems

1860
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,719
to deal with that's completely fine

1861
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,120
that's a totally legitimate thing but

1862
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:42,840
then you don't but you don't get to go

1863
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,400
drop bombs on other people and at the

1864
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:48,120
same time say that you don't care about

1865
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:49,840
what happens to them like no no one

1866
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:51,120
that's it like imagine if a Russian said

1867
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,840
I don't care what what happens in

1868
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:55,120
Ukraine we'd

1869
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:57,520
all so it's so OB VI that that's an

1870
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:59,639
idiotic statement because Russia is the

1871
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,120
reason things are happening in Ukraine

1872
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:03,600
we are the reason things are happening

1873
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:05,239
in Gaza we are the reason that shiffa

1874
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,880
hospital is not a functional Place

1875
01:22:05,239 --> 01:22:08,400
anymore we're the reason there's no Road

1876
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,960
system we're the reason there's no

1877
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,040
sewage system we're the reason that the

1878
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,639
population of Gaza might now be half a

1879
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,960
million less than it was two years

1880
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:19,960
ago you don't get to just say you don't

1881
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,840
care that that's not that when you

1882
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,600
commit crimes you're responsible for

1883
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,400
them that's a basic moral precept that

1884
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,920
literally nobody has had a hard time

1885
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:30,199
understanding and that's why so much

1886
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,920
effort is taken into trying to pretend

1887
01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:34,400
that this is a conflict going on between

1888
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,760
two other people over there and that

1889
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:40,120
we're just this silent Observer that's

1890
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:43,719
not the situation at all and I'll just

1891
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:47,960
add um that you know um the

1892
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:51,480
taxpayer um in the US pays funded this

1893
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:54,800
war much more than I did as an Israeli

1894
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:57,040
taxpayer so I this is why uh if if you

1895
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,000
if you if you care for like what your

1896
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,960
tax money is doing then you should care

1897
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,679
about

1898
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:05,639
this absolutely and I would say as a

1899
01:23:02,679 --> 01:23:07,600
pediatrician um to just think as as you

1900
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:11,440
both said like more than 50% of the

1901
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:14,199
population are children um it's just

1902
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:16,840
horrifying to think what they've endured

1903
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:21,280
and how many of them have been killed

1904
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:24,639
and M um it's just unfathomable um I I

1905
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:27,080
love quotes so um I'm going to say uh J

1906
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:30,120
Baldwin's quote the children are always

1907
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:32,320
ours every single one of them all over

1908
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:34,800
the globe and I'm beginning to suspect

1909
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:38,120
that whoever is incapable of recognizing

1910
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:42,120
this may be incapable of

1911
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:45,120
morality um I want to give Erica a

1912
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:46,760
chance to uh share with us some of what

1913
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,960
they are doing at

1914
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:53,719
MIT uh

1915
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:57,560
Erica can yes um please first of all uh

1916
01:23:53,719 --> 01:24:02,679
thank you Ima Yas and fose for such a

1917
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:05,159
provocative moving and um personal uh

1918
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:08,360
discussion today I truly appreciate it

1919
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:11,120
and hope that future viewers will be

1920
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:13,960
able to benefit from your experience and

1921
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:16,800
your knowledge and expertise uh going

1922
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:18,960
forward um some of the themes I think

1923
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:22,360
that stood out for me and and again I

1924
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:24,400
come from doing most of my professional

1925
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:27,440
research in Haiti which is a country

1926
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:29,199
country that has been in battled for for

1927
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:32,639
different kinds of reasons but that has

1928
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:34,880
also suffered with u

1929
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:38,199
multigenerational uh endurance of

1930
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:41,440
political conflict poverty violence of

1931
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:44,600
many kinds and the long-term

1932
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:47,280
psychosocial aftermath so I've I've

1933
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:49,480
thought about you know several questions

1934
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,239
in your conversation you were thinking

1935
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:56,480
about how do we how do we Rank and

1936
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:59,480
decide what is the best best way to uh

1937
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:02,440
assist or intervene in the post quote

1938
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:03,880
whatever the so-called post era will be

1939
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:06,440
whether there's a period of Peace

1940
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,040
whether it endur so that's one theme

1941
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,960
that I think we're thinking about you

1942
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:12,920
know is it basic needs first before

1943
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:16,159
mental health or is it infrastructure

1944
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:19,080
and my experience from Haiti in working

1945
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:20,719
on the postconflict period there is it

1946
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:23,679
kind of has to be all of them at the

1947
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:25,800
same time but still there may not be

1948
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:28,440
successes one thing that in my my

1949
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,800
research has shown is that the the

1950
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:34,280
survivors of politically motivated

1951
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:37,719
violence without a future whether it was

1952
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:41,119
education employment Etc became the

1953
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:44,320
later gang members who are you know now

1954
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:47,080
in many ways destabilizing Haiti you

1955
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:51,440
know so I'm I'm hopeful that uh that

1956
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:53,560
there will be you know a a sovereign um

1957
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:56,000
entity that can make decisions for

1958
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:58,840
itself yeah Yas mean's points about

1959
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,960
there needing to be kind of expertise on

1960
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:04,719
the ground that sort of leads the way

1961
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,159
but then also collaborations with uh

1962
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:10,119
community members across borders across

1963
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:12,840
disciplines I think that's also critical

1964
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:16,440
um we also talked a lot about especially

1965
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:19,679
for Rose the question of um our

1966
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:22,520
complicity meaning Americans complicity

1967
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:26,320
with types of political action the

1968
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,840
militarism and um intervention

1969
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:30,440
overseas um as well as our own

1970
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:32,719
responsibility and I think that's

1971
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:36,639
something I would love um in the future

1972
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:39,719
to take on to Greater degree is how how

1973
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:42,760
do we understand what responsibility we

1974
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:45,560
each bear individually and then expand

1975
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:49,239
out and and then to think more about

1976
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:52,320
then what what does the level of our own

1977
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:54,320
responsibility mean in terms of how much

1978
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:57,719
we should engage to try to help repair

1979
01:26:54,320 --> 01:27:00,800
care or to uh bring about Justice you

1980
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:03,560
know for crimes or for harms however you

1981
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:06,159
want to speak of it um we talked a lot

1982
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:10,440
today too about the question of the

1983
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:13,639
value of life and how it's it has become

1984
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:16,880
normative to devalue certain populations

1985
01:27:13,639 --> 01:27:19,239
lives in the world and especially dazin

1986
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:24,560
and and the the extent to which we spoke

1987
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:26,719
about um the the calculation of you know

1988
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,880
not only nutritional values but you know

1989
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:31,040
the the categorization of whether

1990
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,600
something has a single use or a dual use

1991
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:39,080
and you know this type of mentality or

1992
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:42,199
this type of um uh ideology I find I I

1993
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:43,840
wonder how does one uh these are

1994
01:27:42,199 --> 01:27:47,880
questions for the future but how do you

1995
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:50,679
move from sort of this um precautionary

1996
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:54,320
position and always anticipating the the

1997
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:58,520
worst um and so such that humanitarian

1998
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:01,520
Aid is viewed as you know potentially it

1999
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:03,920
a source of future um resistance or

2000
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:06,800
protest on the part of you know Gins or

2001
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:09,400
whoever I mean that that I think is is a

2002
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,960
a broader philosophical question I did

2003
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:14,800
want to also just to point out to our

2004
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:17,679
viewers that the MIT libraries is going

2005
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:20,800
to be hosting this webinar we are going

2006
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:22,119
to be putting up full bios of all of our

2007
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:25,159
speakers and

2008
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:27,880
participants uh we will also have

2009
01:28:25,159 --> 01:28:30,800
suggestions for those of you who want to

2010
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:32,119
you know either get involved locally or

2011
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,719
you know to support some of the

2012
01:28:32,119 --> 01:28:36,119
international organizations and

2013
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:38,800
institutions that we mentioned today we

2014
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:41,960
will put all of that information and we

2015
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:44,920
will put links to the article that um

2016
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:48,040
ferose has written with a colleague and

2017
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:50,440
other other resources uh to help you as

2018
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:54,400
you begin to learn I I took very

2019
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:56,639
seriously as well the question of

2020
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,880
all of us individuals who are asking

2021
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:02,239
what can we

2022
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:07,159
do start locally building relation

2023
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:10,199
learning about others and maybe ask how

2024
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:13,400
can I be of help maybe not to we should

2025
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:15,320
assume that we know or or never we are

2026
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:19,600
the experts but to hopefully with

2027
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:21,880
humility and a stance of um desire to be

2028
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:24,960

2038
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:54,080
you can reach out to me Erica James

2039
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:57,159
ejames mit.edu uh we were going to be

2040
01:29:54,080 --> 01:30:00,719
hosting a virtual reality exhibit called

2041
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:03,159
The Phoenix of Gaza and it's going to be

2042
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:05,320
limited in terms of how much access but

2043
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:08,199
the exhibit is moving from MIT then it's

2044
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:11,880
going to go to UMass ammer and it shows

2045
01:30:08,199 --> 01:30:15,920
images before during and after October

2046
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:17,560
7th um but a lot of it is about seeing

2047
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,560
what doesn't exist any longer

2048
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,960
Unfortunately um one of my colleagues uh

2049
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:26,000
Dr Devon atala at UMass Boston says that

2050
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:29,320
all of us who are hearing these stories

2051
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,679
and trying to be open are ourselves

2052
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:35,840
embodied archives and right now with

2053
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:37,600
Gaza being virtually destroyed we I

2054
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,760
think have a responsibility to keep

2055
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,719
alive uh the history the memories and to

2056
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,880
the extent that we can second event um

2057
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:47,199
happening at MIT and the department of

2058
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,960
urban studies and planning there's going

2059
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:53,360
to be a two-day Symposium to talk about

2060
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:56,239
the role of urban planning in the

2061
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:58,480
Israeli and Palestinian and specifically

2062
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:59,800
gazan everyday realities I don't know

2063
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:02,080
that that is going to be open to the

2064
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,960
public but they will uh be putting some

2065
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:08,560
things online in the

2066
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:10,440
