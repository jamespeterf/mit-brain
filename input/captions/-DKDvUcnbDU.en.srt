1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,600
A lot of Indian policy on regarding

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,639
clean energy I think and Chinese as well

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,440
has been in my opinion quite pragmatic

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,799
and innovative right so if you look at

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,800
uh cost reductions around solar energy

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,800
India is such a large market uh it

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,080
really is right it's the fourth largest

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,279
wind market in the in the world and

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,119
renewable capacity just last year grew

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,160
by about 35% in India and I think in in

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,840
China solar capacity grew by over 40% uh

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,920
last year. So these markets are large

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,399
and they are growing uh fast and India

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,120
has electrified I think almost all of

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,280
its uh railway network which is a system

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,840
that carries 20 million people every

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,120
day. So it's a like large system and I

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
think a lot of it has been based on in

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
terms of whether it makes sense of the

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,039
economics along with you know does it

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,039
make sense in terms of uh the emissions.
