1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
And now I would like to introduce Seleno

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,040
which is redefining health span through

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,040
precision biio manufacturing. Presenting

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,679
on behalf of Seleno is Willie Reeves.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,279
Welcome to Willie. Good afternoon

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,359
everyone. My name is Willie Reeves. I'm

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,760
the head of public engagement at Celeno

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,519
where we are building a technology stack

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
to scale biommanufacturing of

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
personalized cell tissue and eventually

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
organ therapeutics. Uh, Selenino's labs

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,719
are right down the street at the engine

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,840
and the engine accelerator is one of our

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,600
series A

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,840
investors. Aging contributes to a wide

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,399
range of reg of degenerative conditions

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,399
like those that you see on screen. There

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,879
are literally hundreds of millions of

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,719
patients all around the world waiting

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,280
for cures for conditions just like

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,840
these. Now, at Celeno, we want to shift

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,239
the healthcare paradigm from treating

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,480
symptoms with chronic conditions to

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,120
truly reversing and curing underlying

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,680
diseases. And our vision is to transform

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,159
medicine to extend healthy lifespan for

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,799
billions of people across generations.

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,600
And we do this with autonomous optical

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,040
technologies to scale self-sourced cell,

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,439
tissue, and organ therapeutics.

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,759
Now, we're building a healthier future

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,240
where you can have bespoke living

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
medicines tailored to you as much as a

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,960
custom suit made from your very own

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
cells. And the way this process works is

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,520
that you start with a blood sample and

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,000
then we reprogram those blood cells into

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,280
IPS-CED or induced pluropotent stem

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,439
cells. And then those IPS-C's can become

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,119
virtually any cell type in the body as

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
you can see here. So there's a

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,920
tremendous potential to treat, reverse,

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,520
cure a huge r wide range of different

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
conditions. And a couple of other things

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,240
about these therapies. They are

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
autotogus. They come from your own

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
cells. That means you don't need a donor

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
match. You don't have to wait around for

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,759
years trying to find someone who's a

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
match to you. And this really opens up

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,759
the opportunity and the window for a

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,240
maximum number of patients to be able to

53
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
receive these therapies. All that sounds

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,640
great, right? But to get to these

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
therapies at scale, what we've got to do

56
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
is solve the manufacturing issue that's

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,160
currently the bottleneck across the

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,280
entire industry. Now, this is how autous

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,160
IPS-C therapies are made today. It's a

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,720
van very manual processes. Scientists

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,480
are sitting there looking individually

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
under a microscope saying, "Okay, this

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,599
cell colony looks good. That one looks

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
bad." They say things like, "This cell

65
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,160
colony looks fluffy." That is not

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,800
reproducible. It's not scalable. And

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
then to remove the unwanted cells, they

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,239
use a plastic pipet tip scraping away

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,319
with in some degrees 1900's technology

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,160
to remove all the unwanted cells. This

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,840
process is inefficient. It's not

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,680
scalable and it will never meet the

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,200
demands and needs of patients all around

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
the world. So what we are doing is using

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,680
very different approaches that I'll

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,440
explain in a moment because these manual

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,040
approaches lead to also extremely high

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
costs. It can be on the order of a

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
million dollars to generate a single

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,599
cell line with these approaches. So

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,480
instead of manual manufacturing, Celeno

82
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,879
has an optical biorocess that's driven

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,640
by an AI pilot system. So the system

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,120
makes decisions about which cells are

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,040
good or bad based upon our proprietary

86
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,519
machine learning algorithms and then

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,760
instead of scraping away with a pipet,

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,840
we have a laser that can go down to the

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,480
single cell level and zap and remove any

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
unwanted cells. So what this allows us

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
to do is really shrink the

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
infrastructure required for

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,640
manufacturing for a patient from one

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,519
whole clean room individually for each

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,799
patient to a cassette like this one.

96
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,480
This is a Celeno Nebula cassette that is

97
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,480
holds about 10 million cells for a

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
patient dose. And what this allows us to

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
do is this is your cells your cure

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,720
inside of a closed system. So all of the

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,799
cell management, the liquid handling,

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,959
the laser process, all of that happens

103
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,360
inside one of these cassettes. So what

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,360
this allows us to do is parallelize

105
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,680
manufacturing for potentially hundreds

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,000
or thousands of patients in a single

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
facility. And this will help us to bring

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,920
down the cost of manufacturing for

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,959
personalized cell therapies by an order

110
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,560
of magnitude if not

111
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,040
more. Now we like to say at Celeno that

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,880
our scientists are in the loop not in

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,199
the lab. We do have some people pop into

114
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,440
the lab, but what can what you can see

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,360
here is for example, this is Katherine,

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,040
one of our skill biologists, and she's

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
sitting at her computer reviewing data

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,560
from the AI pilot system. So, our

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,080
scientists can log in to this

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
proprietary platform that we've built

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
and say, "Okay, I agree with this data,

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,000
or maybe I want to make a little change

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,479
in the AI pilot system." So, what this

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,240
allows us to do is really move from the

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,919
traditional way. So a very highly

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,520
skilled stem cell scientist can

127
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,479
traditionally manage about 20 cell

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,720
clones per week. But with our autonomous

129
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,040
system, we've already been able to 17x

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,600
that. So they're moving toward 340 cell

131
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,320
lines per week and counting. So what

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,639
this lets us do is unlock creativity,

133
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,280
unlock efficiency for scientists to

134
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,280
focus on highlevel critical thinking

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,199
work, not manual pipe heading.

136
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Now, we are really excited to build a

137
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,880
global network of regenerative medicine

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
foundaries and we're starting that right

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,360
here in Boston through our collaboration

140
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,039
with the Mass General Bighgam Genes and

141
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,639
Cell Therapy Institute. So, we're going

142
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,720
to build the world's first autonomous

143
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,400
IPSC foundry right at Mass General

144
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,160
Hospital and the first clinical

145
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,320
application there is working with Dr.

146
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Jeffrey Schweitzer who's a neurosurgeon

147
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
and we'll be working on IPSC derived

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,880
dopamineergic neurons for Parkinson's.

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,199
We've also got some other collaborations

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,240
announced with Matriself on spinal cord

151
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,080
injury as well as with Carus Bio who I

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,120
actually met with two years ago during

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,520
an MIMIT ILP trip to Japan and South

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,000
Korea. Uh and they are working on

155
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,280
cardiovascular

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,039
disease. So from a partnership

157
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,479
perspective, we are interested in uh

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,240
collaborating with any companies working

159
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
in the personalized cell therapy space,

160
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,720
especially using induced puropotent stem

161
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,639
cells and we're relatively a therapeutic

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,479
area and disease agnostic really looking

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
at chronic degenerative conditions.

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,319
Thank you so much. Really appreciate

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,319
everyone's time today.
