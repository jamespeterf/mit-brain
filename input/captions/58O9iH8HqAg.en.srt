1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:06,899
yeah so I'm a professor in the chemistry

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,160
department at MIT I am also a member of

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,740
the Koch Institute and the broad

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,940
Institute I've also been involved over

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,099
the years at the center for

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,760
Environmental Health and Sciences

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,380
I came to MIT really excited about the

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,080
convergence of engineering and

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,760
Innovative science

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,619
and that's what really drew me I did my

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,320
postdoc at Harvard Meadows Medical

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,660
School across the river with professor

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,000
John collieres studying Anthrax toxin

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,940
trying to understand how infectious

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,340
agents such as Anthrax toxin or cholera

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,219
toxin botulinum neurotoxin actually

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,840
infects cells at the molecular level and

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,899
through those interactions I uh

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,760
certainly heard a lot about MIT and was

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,680
able to interact with people here and

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,559
it's always fascinating wanted to be a

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,600
member of the team here and so in many

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,219
ways I'm very fortunate to have had that

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,160
experience as a postdoc across the river

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,699
but super excited to start here as a

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,880
professor in 2011. before my postdoc I

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,560
actually did my PhD

28
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,000
in at the University of Chicago in

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,979
organic chemistry

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,960
investigating how we can actually use

31
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,420
chemistry to make peptides and proteins

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,400
and that's really these two areas

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,140
influenced me strongly in terms of my

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,259
efforts at MIT that are underway right

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,960
now yeah so I've since my early days in

36
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,939
my education I ultimately wanted to be

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,600
an organic chemist I actually wanted to

38
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,220
go in the laboratory use experiments to

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,979
actually build molecules at the

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,259
molecular level I found that fascinating

41
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,720
and through my journey at University of

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,540
Chicago I met a professor that said Brad

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,700
do you actually know proteins are

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,159
natural products and my laboratory

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,079
actually makes them and so immediately I

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,119
jumped in I said I want to actually make

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,500
proteins using chemistry I thought that

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,479
was fascinating proteins are the

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,180
molecular machines that allow us to live

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,399
and so I thought at some level if we

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,079
could understand them with molecules

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,700
then perhaps in the future we could

53
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,159
design them design them with computers

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,740
design them in the laboratory and that's

55
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,660
exactly what's going on now but through

56
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,819
those efforts at University Chicago I

57
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,940
learned a lot of chemistry but I didn't

58
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,640
learn about biology and so for me to

59
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,640
bring together my education I thought I

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,680
should go do a postdoc trying to

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,540
understand biology how is it that

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,459
infectious disease actually works how is

63
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,319
it Anthrax toxin for instance infects a

64
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,239
cell that really allowed me to connect

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,760
the dots between chemistry and biology

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,099
and so that's a big part of me and how I

67
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,140
actually built my research program at

68
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,900
MIT which is how do we think at the

69
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,580
molecular level how do we design and

70
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,940
understand molecules and then translate

71
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,560
that into some meaningful aspect

72
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,019
hopefully that would affect a human

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,060
being so a big part of my group has

74
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,739
always been to look at nature how does

75
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,080
nature actually solve a lot of the

76
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,060
problems that we think about in terms of

77
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,980
health issues and so we're always

78
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,040
learning from nature a big part of that

79
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,019
was to say okay we have this delivery

80
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,819
problem in biotechnology the delivery

81
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,780
problem refers to the fact that larger

82
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,739
molecules eopeptide a protein and

83
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,140
oligonucleotides simply cannot be

84
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,519
delivered effectively into cells it

85
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,860
can't be delivered across your

86
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,900
gastrointestinal tract and so can we

87
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,900
look to Nature to understand how nature

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,060
impacts delivers like a protein into the

89
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,519
cytoplasm and so that's where the

90
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,860
anthrax inspired me to understand what

91
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,500
is Nature's molecular machine for

92
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,720
delivery of large enzymes into cells and

93
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,120
so we simply ask questions about that

94
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,920
and we rendered Anthrax toxin non-toxic

95
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,379
of course and then asked that question

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,140
can we piggyback or hijack that delivery

97
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,940
system now to actually get proteins into

98
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,799
the cell and the answer is yes we can

99
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,860
and we've been doing that for the past

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,799
10 years and we continuously learn in

101
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,659
those efforts and in thinking through

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,180
how do we solve these big challenges

103
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,220
another issue is it just takes too long

104
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,500
to do experiments it takes a long time

105
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,180
to make the molecules prepare them and

106
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,760
then let alone go study them in an

107
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,860
animal or in tissue culture on cells and

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
so forth so in light of that in the

109
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,760
spirit of MIT we've been asking over and

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
over again how do we accelerate the pace

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,480
in which we actually do science a big

112
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,000
part of it in the chemistry department

113
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,340
is okay we need to make molecules and so

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,959
we've built robots that essentially are

115
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,180
at this stage of where you type in

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,400
molecules proteins that you would like

117
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,440
and you hit go on the machine and it

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,840
actually makes it and that's the basis

119
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,139
of what we call a rapid flow or

120
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,759
automated flow protein synthesis now

121
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:39,000
we're continuously expanding that

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,100
technology to the case in which it will

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,139
be next time hopefully in 10 years when

124
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,940
I'm giving an interaction or interview

125
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,900
we actually make a protein while we're

126
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,900
having the discussion
