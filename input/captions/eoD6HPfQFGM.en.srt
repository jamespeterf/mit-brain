00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:23,730
[Music]

2
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,280
okay well welcome everyone um I W to I

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:36,160
welcome you to to uh this

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:40,280
um uh week's Nano exploration seminar so

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,600
um today's speaker is Emma Batson who's

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,039
going to be talking about uh superc

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,239
conducting nanowire Electronics in

8
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,199
magnesium diboride I'm Carl bergren um I

9
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,239
have the Good Fortune of being Emma's

10
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,640
adviser and uh Emma is a fourth year

11
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,680
grad student in the group uh she is an

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,359
NSF graduate research fellow and she's

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,719
been working she's worked on couple

14
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,040
projects over time uh all related to

15
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,600
superc conducting materials in one way

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,920
or another and so I'm very happy to host

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,920
this a couple quick housekeeping um

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,759
points uh if you have questions during

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,080
your talk we won't be able to answer

20
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,439
them during the talk but um go ahead and

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,600
answer them into the chat or into the

22
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,600
Q&A or raise your hand and we'll get to

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,000
them at the end um so with that I'd like

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,759
to go ahead and welcome Emma Batson

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,360
thanks for the introduction I'll jump

26
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,840
right right in uh because I know that

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,759
not everybody here is uh familiar with

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,840
superconductors I thought I would start

29
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,439
with a quick discussion of how our

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,479
devices work uh the main principle is

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,840
that we actually use the superconducting

32
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,200
transition of our Nano wires as a switch

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,040
so superconductors can switch through

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,640
temperature current or field um how it

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,079
might look if we Ed the temperature

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,000
transition as a kind of a device level

37
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,799
information is that when the device is

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,320
cold uh there's zero resistance and we

39
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,599
could treat that as a kind of zero State

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
uh but then once it's warmed up above a

41
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,760
certain critical temperature uh now

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,519
suddenly we have all of this resistance

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,280
and we have a measurable voltage so that

44
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,760
could be treated as a one state but for

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,280
a number of reasons using this thermal

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,480
transition wouldn't be very great for

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,800
devices it would be slow and um not very

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,640
high signal so what we usually use in a

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,879
device is a switching current transition

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,280
in this case when a current below a

51
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,959
certain level is applied to the device

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
uh the current can pass through without

53
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,040
any resistance at all this is actually

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,920
kind of a a bad example in this plot

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,239
because this this device was fairly

56
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,480
heavily uh shunted but normally um this

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,040
the line in the middle would just be

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,000
straight up and down and so we can pass

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,720
current through without getting any

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,239
voltage whatsoever but then once the

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,360
current rises above a certain amount uh

62
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,440
we we suddenly enter this resistive

63
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,599
regime and all of the current that was

64
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,319
being applied now is shunted into

65
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,560
voltage what this looks like for a

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,640
practical device uh our kind of um main

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,959
focus is on superc conducting single

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,319
Photon detectors what happens is we bias

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,920
the device to a current just below what

70
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,879
would cause it to switch such that even

71
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,959
a single Photon hitting the device is

72
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,080
enough to cause a small region to switch

73
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,879
into that resistive regime as a result

74
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,319
we get this nice sharp voltage pulse uh

75
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,799
before the device relaxes back into the

76
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,159
superconducting

77
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,239
state this has a lot of potential

78
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,799
applications in fields like dark matter

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,519
search biomedical Imaging or astronomy

80
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,480
anywhere that we have uh low signals of

81
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,799
low energy photons and we want to detect

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,319
them with very little noise um one one

83
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,000
way in which these detectors imp prove

84
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,519
over something like a silicon based

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
detector is that silicon is actually

86
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,280
transparent in the near infrared so

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,280
these devices can detect photons that

88
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,519
silicon simply cannot so for that reason

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,880
we're very interested in these

90
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,759
detectors and fortunately for us we also

91
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,000
have some compatible logical devices

92
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,520
that can work in exactly the same

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,160
platform we have the nanoc cryotron that

94
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,440
work kind of on the same Principle as

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,960
our detector but instead of switching

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,440
them with a photon we actually switch

97
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,759
them with a controlled current pulse

98
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,000
that we inject intentionally to perform

99
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,560
logical operations and similarly we have

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,400
a device that works on the thermal

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,280
switching called a heater Nano prron and

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,360
with these three terminal switching

103
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,240
devices um that have you know kind of

104
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,919
transistor like operation we've actually

105
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,039
managed to create superc conducting

106
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,880
memories in logic that could potentially

107
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:05,080
be used to read out these detectors in a

108
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,199
scalable way all within the cat and on

109
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,840
the same platform so with very little

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,120
losses of of our

111
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,960
information however uh the typical

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,400
nanowire device materials that we've

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,319
previously explored are are pretty

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,400
limited to a very specific family of

115
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,759
kind of transition metal nitrides and

116
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,440
pilicides uh while these devices in

117
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,319
these materials are great for a number

118
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,639
of reasons um they're fairly Limited by

119
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,400
the low gap uh which leads to a low

120
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,319
transition temperature and the fact that

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,360
they're almost always these amorphous or

122
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,440
poly crystallin films um at first this

123
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,680
may not seem like maybe such a bad thing

124
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,560
uh but when we consider for instance

125
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
that our current Dynamics are actually

126
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,639
dependent on temperature uh the closer

127
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,240
we operate our device to the transition

128
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,840
temperature Point uh the less we have

129
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,639
these really dramatic uh hysteretic

130
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,560
switching shapes to our current voltage

131
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,319
curve uh and so that really degrades the

132
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,680
device performance so we want to be able

133
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,440
to operate our

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,880
devices pretty much um as cold as

135
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,240
possible relative to the transition

136
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,759
temperature A good rule of thumb is that

137
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,440
it's pretty tough to operate these

138
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,039
devices at uh let's say more than half

139
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,639
of the transition temperature and the

140
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,800
materials that I was talking about uh

141
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,120
that tends to be 4 Kelvin operation or

142
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,880
even less and to get to 4 Kelvin we need

143
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,520
these expensive and energy consuming

144
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,039
compressors uh and very high quality

145
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,720
heat pumps uh in order to reach these

146
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,479
temperatures and that really limits uh

147
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,800
right now the the the deployment of

148
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,240
these devices that that limits the kinds

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,280
of places that might be able to operate

150
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,879
such a

151
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,000
system but state-of-the-art cry stats

152
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,960
can get 35 Kelvin operation uh with just

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,479
something that sits on a table and plugs

154
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,840
into normal wall power so with the

155
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,879
cryocooler technology advancing um we

156
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,400
should be catching up to to take

157
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,160
advantage of these new cryocoolers if we

158
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,479
could operate at 35 Kelvin then we could

159
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,240
use a device like this and we could

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,520
deploy our uh devices much more widely

161
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
that's where magnesium dorite comes in

162
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,319
it's a superconductor with a transition

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,879
temperature of 39 Kelvin so it would be

164
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,680
a challenge to operate this at 35 Kelvin

165
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,120
but it's within the realm of possibility

166
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,639
we can at least hope to to operate it at

167
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,120
20 Kelvin or so without any heroic

168
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,680
efforts um it also is a good material

169
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,639
because it has a high critical current

170
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,400
and high critical field um and and part

171
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,759
of this comes from the interesting fact

172
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,680
that it actually has two distinct gaps

173
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,960
the larger of which um contributes a lot

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,120
to the high transition temperature uh

175
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,080
while still

176
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,479
maintaining superconducting behavior

177
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,599
that is understandable within common

178
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,240
models of super conductivity namely BCS

179
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:10,240
Theory so we found some collaborators at

180
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,280
chers and JPL that can give us different

181
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,360
kinds of magnesium diboride so we have a

182
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,520
very large space that we can explore

183
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,319
with this material at Chalmers they

184
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,000
specialize in hybrid physical chemical

185
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
vapor deposition or

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,280
hpcvd this provides magnesium diboride

187
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,440
with the best properties very close to

188
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,240
bulk sometimes even better because of

189
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,560
strain in the film uh but unfortunately

190
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,880
it's slow to grow and we can really only

191
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,959
get you know a 1 cm square piece a

192
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,000
handful of those at a time from them

193
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,159
we're also working with a group at JPL

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,640
that's learned how to magnetron sputter

195
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,560
magnesium diboride more similar uh

196
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,399
technique to the way that our s

197
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,480
pilicides and nitrides are usually grown

198
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,200
we have some compromise on the film

199
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,519
properties in this case the TCS tend to

200
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,120
be lower maybe more like 35 Kelvin but

201
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,959
it does allow wafer scale deposition and

202
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,800
that give us a lot more space for

203
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,320
instance to iterate on our fabrication

204
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,320
processes and that's important because

205
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,560
fabricating devices in magnesium

206
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,560
diboride is extremely challenging it's

207
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,120
somewhat easily corroded by moisture and

208
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,399
that can be moisture that's present um

209
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,959
in hygroscopic solvents like acetone uh

210
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,800
it's not very easy to reactively etch it

211
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,600
has a very different chemistry than the

212
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,440
transition metal nitrides and pilicides

213
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,920
that we're used to trying to added

214
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,000
and as a result of these challenges

215
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,720
although people have successfully made

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,160
Single Photon detectors in this material

217
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,959
uh there are very often one-off events

218
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,279
um people rarely report multiple

219
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,120
detectors made with the same frication

220
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,000
techniques um and so there's a huge need

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,959
for scalability and reproducibility of

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Fabrication in this material and uh Nano

223
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,800
gives us a great OPP opportunity um to

224
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,519
work on those

225
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,440
things so first I'll talk about our

226
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,800
efforts with epitaxial or hpcvd films

227
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,800
and uh this collaboration is a bit older

228
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,920
so our results here are a bit more

229
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,360
developed um and and particularly what

230
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,959
we've made with these films are wide

231
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,560
wire superconducting nanowire single

232
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,480
Photon detectors not really nanowire

233
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,399
anymore more like microwire but uh that

234
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,920
SPD isn't quite as catchy so the

235
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,200
fabrication process that we use used for

236
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
these detectors involved first

237
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,959
encapsulating our films with a thin

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,160
layer of silicon and then using an ebam

239
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,920
resist as well as a charge dissipation

240
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,760
layer we favor Electra 92 and using ebam

241
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,920
lithography with either the hs50 or the

242
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,959
f-125 depending on what we're trying to

243
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,959
do to pattern our

244
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,760
wires we can then rinse off the charge

245
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,839
dissipation layer and we do a cold

246
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,920
develop and we used the Argon ion Mill

247
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,760
in Lucha L's lab to do the pattern

248
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,920
transfer to magnesium diboride this is

249
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,120
under construction uh we're no longer

250
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,839
really using this fabrication process

251
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,880
for our our device patterning we're

252
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,920
working on bigger and better things

253
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,519
mainly uh looking at improving our

254
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,040
encapsulation looking at better resists

255
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,880
for the pattern transfer and ways to use

256
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,519
the Samco miixed R ICP that's in Nano um

257
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,440
for the pattern transfer instead but

258
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,360
that's all coming soon um the final step

259
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,480
that's interesting and and a little bit

260
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,600
novel in this fabrication process is a

261
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,600
sort of post fabrication step of helium

262
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,839
ion exposure and we do this in the

263
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,920
zerion tool in Building

264
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,880
24 it has an atomically sharp tip that

265
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,240
can excite a very narrow beam of helium

266
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,160
ions at about 20 to 30 K and we scan

267
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,800
this over our entire device to give it a

268
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,920
uniform radiation of helium this has

269
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,600
been done for other superconducting

270
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,240
material materials such as niobium

271
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,200
nitride and mly pilicide and actually

272
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,920
found to improve the performance of the

273
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,440
detectors as a

274
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,440
result when we do some simulation of

275
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,920
this to get insight into what's going on

276
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,079
we see that indeed um a lot of helium

277
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,720
ions can make it through the resist

278
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,480
Collide in our film and actually embed

279
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,680
themselves somewhere in the substrate we

280
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,120
compute that about 150 helium ions is

281
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,639
colliding with our super condu in thin

282
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,639
film uh you may be wondering why does

283
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,360
that make the detectors better and

284
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,519
that's exactly the question that we've

285
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,880
been trying to answer uh with STM and

286
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,800
other techniques within Nano but the

287
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,360
theoretical hypothesis is that each of

288
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,120
these collisions can create a single

289
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,040
point defect it displaces one of the

290
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:59,199
Magnesium or Boron atoms into uh what

291
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,079
should have been a vac a vacancy so the

292
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:05,720
defect pair is a vacancy interstitial

293
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,320
pair as a result the micro structure is

294
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,320
locally changed in some ways it's made

295
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,440
more defective it might seem odd that

296
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,240
that would make the device performance

297
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,160
better but in the case of our wire

298
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,279
geometry detectors what we really want

299
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,120
is to have as great a percentage of the

300
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,440
device very close to being switched so

301
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,199
if there's one point Point that's

302
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,279
constricted then the whole device is

303
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:38,720
limited to being biased at a lower level

304
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,120
if we can introduce a uniform film of

305
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,560
defects everywhere that floods out these

306
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,920
native defects then perhaps that's

307
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,279
actually sort of bringing the whole wire

308
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,880
down to the same level as the original

309
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,639
worst part uh and that increases the

310
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,399
uniformity letting more of the detector

311
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,240
uh participate in detection at a given

312
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,560
current Vias

313
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,800
level um so we can also uh simulate that

314
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,560
there's a difference in effective dose

315
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,680
depending on encapsulation so you may

316
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,959
have noticed that in my fabrication

317
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,839
process I never actually stripped the

318
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,279
resist this is because of concern about

319
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,199
what harsh solvents that can take in a

320
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,639
lot of water like nmp and acetone might

321
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,639
do to the side walls of my film um

322
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,160
however this is definitely going to

323
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,759
change the effect of the helium ions

324
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,480
whether you choose to do that or not uh

325
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,399
the resist layer actually slows down the

326
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,560
ions uh leading to up to three times

327
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,519
more vacancies predicted in the

328
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,639
Magnesium diboride that had resist on

329
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,480
top um so here we can see this line is

330
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,720
the depth within just the superc

331
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,240
conducting film of the Magnesium

332
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,839
diboride that was

333
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,240
encapsulated this line represents the

334
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,040
Magnesium diboride that wasn't encaps

335
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,920
ated so little choices like this in the

336
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,199
fabrication can make a huge difference

337
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,240
to post fabrication techniques like

338
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:11,480
helium ion

339
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
radiation uh so all of that said let's

340
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,279
take a look at what actually we get what

341
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,880
are the results when we expose magnesium

342
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:23,160
diboride that's encapsulated in this way

343
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,079
with helium ions um I don't have uh a

344
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,199
plot showing the negative but just take

345
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:31,199
my word for it that before IR radiation

346
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:34,040
this detector was completely insensitive

347
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,079
to light uh we put tons and tons of

348
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,560
light down the the fiber optic into this

349
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,839
device and absolutely nothing happened

350
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,759
except that it got a little bit warmer

351
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,680
um post radiation we actually sort of

352
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,600
radiated it too much leading to a a

353
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,639
pretty major suppression of the

354
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,360
transition temperature but at about half

355
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,920
of the transition temperature we still

356
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,079
have this nice IV curve that has this

357
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,240
dramatic transition at the switch in

358
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,720
point and indeed uh we're able to get

359
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,959
counts we get up to a th000 counts per

360
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:13,160
second with 100 dark counts per second

361
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,480
at 1550 nanometers light at 10 Kelvin

362
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,600
which is half of the transition

363
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,800
temperature this is for a one micron

364
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,920
wide wire that was radiated to a dose of

365
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,720
1 time 10 15 ions per square cm another

366
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,360
thing that's interesting here is that we

367
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,519
actually get these relaxation

368
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,440
oscillations at a much faster rate than

369
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,800
our maximum Photon count rate this sort

370
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,519
of indicates that the efficiency of our

371
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,199
device is not so good it could count

372
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,839
faster the Dynamics can go up to higher

373
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:48,079
speeds um but we're not able to get

374
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,319
enough of the device sensitive to

375
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,160
measure that many photons um so our

376
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,759
sensitivity is is maybe a little bit low

377
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,440
but our material is still pretty good it

378
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:03,639
still has these fast Dynamics

379
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,400
and um one thing oh and this this work

380
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,839
has been accepted to i e transactions on

381
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,600
applied superc conductivity so keep an

382
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:15,439
eye out for that and uh some results

383
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,720
that were even better uh were on helium

384
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,520
exposed magnesium diboride without

385
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,799
encapsulation so in this case at an even

386
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,720
higher dose so 5 time 10^ 15 ions per

387
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:29,320
square cimer uh we actually see that the

388
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,360
transition temperature is effective very

389
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,320
little uh so if we get the correct dose

390
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,679
then the sort of broader properties of

391
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,919
our detectors are largely unchanged but

392
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,080
they still go from being insensitive to

393
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:46,880
light to Counting photons at up to 20

394
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,280
Kelvin again uh we see this count rate

395
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,520
of a thousand counts per second and we

396
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,039
also have a very fast pulsing Behavior

397
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,400
Uh so again our our our efficiency may

398
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,919
be limited but our detector Dynamics are

399
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,200
really fast and we're able to go up to

400
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,559
really high operating temperatures so

401
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,159
this is very exciting and and the next

402
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,360
step as I see it is to explore this

403
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,159
hypothesis of of why the irradiation is

404
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,679
improving our results um and this is

405
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,679
this work has been accepted to Nature

406
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,159
Communications so keep an eye out for

407
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,799
that as well so uh we took these

408
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,520
detectors and we prepared a Lamela from

409
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:30,000
them to explore in the Themis and what

410
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,120
we find is really striking actually so

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,240
on the the epitaxial parts of the film

412
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,440
um some of them remain epitaxial and we

413
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,200
can actually see the single Atomic

414
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,120
resolution in these areas however to the

415
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,880
to the left of this image there's

416
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,799
there's no single Atomic resolution at

417
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,360
all in the Magnesium diboride layer

418
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,320
anymore and we attribute this to the

419
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,720
helium ion irradiation amorphizing this

420
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,159
part of the film which is in line with

421
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,880
our understanding that it's introducing

422
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:06,200
these defects it's damaging the lattice

423
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,039
structure uh so that's good support that

424
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,120
this is uh what's going on here another

425
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,400
great thing we can do with the Themis is

426
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,799
look at where the different atoms are

427
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,600
located with eels uh so if you're

428
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:24,320
familiar um EDS allows us to see

429
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,559
magnesium and Eels allows us to see

430
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,559
Boron unfortunately it's very difficult

431
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,080
for us to see both atoms at the same

432
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,280
time time but magnesium loves to oxidize

433
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,320
so the location of the Boron atoms is

434
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,720
actually a really good proxy for where

435
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,720
the Magnesium diboride th film

436
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,559
originally was and the location of

437
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,159
oxygen is a good proxy for what has

438
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,559
oxidized and where the Magnesium may

439
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:55,120
have diffused out of the film and

440
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:58,720
oxidized instead so what we can see here

441
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,000
is that we do still have a really clear

442
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,320
stripe of boron where it should be so

443
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,679
this is again evidence that the atoms

444
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,080
are moving around as a result of a

445
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,640
radiation but they're not getting kicked

446
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,440
out of the film or anything like that uh

447
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,600
but the other thing that's striking is

448
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,919
that we do have these oxygen-rich layers

449
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,280
uh strikingly above and a little bit

450
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,039
below the Boron so we can kind of tell

451
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,760
from that that our encapsulation may not

452
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,919
be good enough right now we are losing

453
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,559
some of our film um so that's one of the

454
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,240
reasons why we want to go back and

455
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,960
improve our fabrication techniques a

456
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,120
little bit and that's really been

457
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,880
enabled by these STM characterization

458
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:43,360
studies so that's all for the uh wide

459
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,320
wires on um epitaxial films I think the

460
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,679
work we've been able to do there is is

461
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,640
really exciting but at the same time it

462
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,960
points to some limitations in our

463
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,200
fabrication processes uh that could be

464
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,480
better suited uh to exploring with large

465
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,640
batches of films such as the magnetron

466
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,840
sputtered films

467
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,440
so I'll talk a little bit about about

468
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,880
these just briefly uh We've also done

469
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,080
some stdm interface studies of these

470
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,159
films um we confirmed what our

471
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,200
collaborators told us which is that it's

472
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,520
about 30 nanometers cap capping layer of

473
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,240
boron on top of 40 nanm magnesium

474
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,360
diboride on top of 30 nanometers of

475
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,840
silicon nitride the reason for the

476
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,919
Silicon nitride is that again magnesium

477
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,720
loves to react with things if it's

478
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,279
sputtered directly onto the Silicon then

479
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,120
a large quantity of silicon will tend to

480
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,840
migrate uh and and react with the

481
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,919
Magnesium we can also confirm through

482
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,279
again EDS in this case that indeed the

483
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:46,320
Silicon nitride capping layer is

484
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:49,760
protecting us pretty well the Magnesium

485
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,799
remains really well localized um within

486
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,080
the Magnesium diboride layer um in this

487
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,840
case I I guess I wasn't able to get a

488
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,320
silicon signal um but the the nitride

489
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,600
and the the oxygen have also kind of

490
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,919
stayed where they belonged um so this is

491
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,480
all indication that this magnetron

492
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,919
sputtering technique does work pretty

493
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,320
well and produces pretty clean

494
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,360
films so uh thanks to papia blocks we've

495
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,840
been able to plan and prepare some

496
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,760
pretty crazy uh long fabrication

497
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,200
techniques that allow us to keep the

498
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,279
film encapsulated as as much as possible

499
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,080
uh so we really appreciate the the use

500
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:37,559
of this tool for helping us visualize

501
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,120
you know um how well our film is

502
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,440
protected at any given point and um

503
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,919
we've actually managed to go through uh

504
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,640
our first run of this new fabrication

505
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,720
method and create some devices a and uh

506
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,279
we're actually undergoing testing of

507
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,279
these devices uh right now so we're

508
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,640
pretty excited to see where where this

509
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,520
leads us with these new magnetron

510
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,600
sputtered films and to iterate on this

511
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,080
fabrication technique going

512
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,880
forward future directions are going to

513
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,880
include continuing the STM studies

514
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,240
particularly comparing irradiated to

515
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,320
non- irradiated films and looking at

516
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,559
more STM of these sputtered uh film

517
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,600
lamelas to make sure that we're looking

518
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:27,000
at really the best possible um technique

519
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,520
there we also need to work on this

520
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,240
fabrication technique a little bit not

521
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,440
all of our devices come out uh this one

522
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,400
in particular is an example of a device

523
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,400
that was incredibly overed uh so that

524
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,480
they don't all work we need a few more

525
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,360
iterations to improve the stability and

526
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,720
reproducibility here and we're also

527
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,600
exploring other characterization methods

528
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,760
that would help us figure out what's

529
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,919
going on a little more easily as we're

530
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,720
going through the fabrication such as

531
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,880
trying to De develop a vasal lipometry

532
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,799
model uh for these films which is quite

533
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,440
challenging um because magnesium diorite

534
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,480
is quite anisotropic and we don't have a

535
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,159
model for it or for the Boron capping

536
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,159
layer um so as you can see from these

537
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:20,159
fits we've had some progress on this

538
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:22,600
front but the model isn't the best um so

539
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,799
I'd like to thank uh everybody in the

540
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,760

talk uh I'll take any questions

553
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,399
okay well uh thanks Emma that was great

554
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,640
so um we have time for plenty of time

555
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:14,480
for questions so um please go ahead and

556
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,640
put them in the chat or uh the Q&A or

557
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,440
raise your hand I'm not sure um don't

558
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,039
see any hands raised yet so I think I'll

559
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,919
start it off um by

560
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:31,760
asking um so you you showed can you

561
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,799
could you flip back to the eels uh data

562
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,600
so uh you mentioned that there was

563
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,240
a there was Boron and I'm trying to line

564
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,440
up the EVS pictures below or sorry the

565
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,480
eels pictures below with the temm above

566
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,880
and you see this interface layer so U

567
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,600
the first thing I'm wondering is is that

568
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,360
interface layer just silicon carbide or

569
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,120
is there something else in there

570
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,080
um yeah so it's a little hard to tell

571
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,000
unfortunately the eels detector is a

572
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,080
different detector than the one we get

573
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,480
these really nice images from so I don't

574
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,399
have anything that quite exactly lines

575
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,720
up these single Atomic resolution images

576
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:20,840
with eels in

577
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:23,279
part um I think the I believe that based

578
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,080
on the scale of things the Magnesium

579
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,000
diboride layer was quoted at being seven

580
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,200
nanometers thick so I think that the

581
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,440
interface layer has to be affected by

582
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,600
magnesium diboride otherwise we're kind

583
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,960
of missing um some material I I think

584
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,200
it's possibly um if we look at eels we

585
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,679
can see that there is this layer below

586
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,919
the Boron that looks sort of oxidized or

587
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,240
something so it could be that this is

588
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,799
kind of a

589
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:57,279
magnesium uh mixture on on top of the

590
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,840
silicon carbide I'm not exactly sure it

591
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,960
could also just be the that it's

592
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,200
magnesium diboride with a kind of weird

593
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,120
lattice uh going on um yeah I've thought

594
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,320
about it but I don't I don't totally

595
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,799
know okay great thank you um so we have

596
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,000
some questions now in the questions and

597
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,679
answers section thanks everyone for

598
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,919
putting those in um so let's start with

599
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:26,559
Chang sub Kim um so CH says maybe I

600
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:31,039
missed it but what kind of vacancies

601
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:33,600
Atomic like mg or B are you creating

602
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,480
when you irradiate with helium

603
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,519
ions that's a great question um so

604
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,840
because we don't expect these atoms to

605
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:44,880
leave the film we expect that they're

606
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,880
knocked out of their original lattice

607
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,519
position but they remain within the film

608
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,200
it would be a little hard to tell with

609
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:55,279
compositional techniques like eels or

610
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,279
EDS I believe

611
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:01,679
that uh because the Boron is lider it's

612
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,159
probably more prone to getting knocked

613
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,080
around and I think we could probably

614
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,640
double check our simulation data to see

615
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,919
if that's what we would expect uh but I

616
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,880
I think it would be kind of tough to

617
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,240
experimentally confirm which it is um

618
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,440
it's a great question I'd have to think

619
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,760
about it yeah changsub suggests that

620
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,559
maybe we could use XPS to check the

621
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:30,039
veilance states of the residual films

622
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,440
you know as you bore down which is an

623
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,919
interesting idea so I a great I wouldn't

624
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,960
know how to do that but maybe now we

625
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,880
know who to ask for more information oh

626
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,399
um I actually do have XPS experience I

627
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,399
used it a lot for the I

628
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:48,519
project I just haven't thought about it

629
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:50,200
in a while well yeah I guess the right

630
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,600
yeah I think that the question is sort

631
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,159
of what are the veilance states that

632
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,039
tell you whether it's magnesium that's

633
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,559
missing or Boron that's missing I guess

634
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:01,720
um so uh

635
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,440
so ODed Rabin asks a second question

636
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,159
which is I think you or yeah their first

637
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,000
question I think you said that this type

638
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,000
of single Photon sensor uh has a lower

639
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,519
dark signal than other types why why is

640
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,799
that um

641
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:21,039
it's uh pretty stable I believe so so

642
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,320
the main limitations are the stability

643
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:28,760
in your operating point so if you can um

644
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,480
extract a really stable current um then

645
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,600
then your operating point will be quite

646
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,760
stable if you're operating at the base

647
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,480
temperature of a particular cryogenic

648
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,799
system so where it's designed to to hold

649
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,760
at then in that case uh the temperature

650
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,760
component of the operating point is

651
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,919
usually very stable as well uh part of

652
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,919
the advantage comes from operating it at

653
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,279
a cool temperature so due to the the

654
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,200
cold operating Point uh we're going to

655
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,080
have less thermal photons that are going

656
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,919
to confuse the noise so to some extent

657
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,519
if you're really trying to minimize the

658
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,880
dark counts you actually don't want to

659
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,519
operate it at a higher temperature in

660
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,679
operating it at a higher temperature we

661
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,720
would be having some tradeoff in the

662
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,679
dark count rate but we still get these

663
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,519
other advantages like the ability to

664
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:20,519
detect uh single photons in the near

665
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:23,120
infrared uh and having very fast reset

666
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:26,039
times yeah so I think

667
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,399
you're maybe to paraphrase that just the

668
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,880
fact that we're able to operate at a

669
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:32,799
lower temperature

670
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,960
helps us in terms of the dark count rate

671
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,480
um yeah okay so then there's a question

672
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,480
here um that says can you comment

673
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,880
further on specifically what's improved

674
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,039
in the new fabrication method compared

675
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,960
to

676
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:50,159
before uh yeah so I

677
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,159
think a lot of the complication that you

678
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:57,039
see here is efforts to keep the film

679
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,720
encapsulated more thoroughly uh so we've

680
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,639
we've we've tried very hard to make sure

681
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,000
that you know we're using a hard mask um

682
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:08,480
so that photo resist never has to come

683
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,039
in contact directly with our film um

684
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,440
after we Mill the sidewalls we're re

685
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,279
encapsulating it with silicon nitride uh

686
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,080
which again as we established with STM

687
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,159
is going to result in very little

688
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,720
diffusion into the film that could

689
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:27,080
damage it um I've put ion Milling here

690
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,000
in this particular iteration but we've

691
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,799
also been explor exploring ways that we

692
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,679
can do the pattern transfer using the

693
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:38,039
ricp tool um which is nice because that

694
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,480
would allow us to do everything in the

695
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,679
clean room um it's also a load locked

696
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,720
tool and if you have some chemistry

697
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,440
involved you have a little bit more

698
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,159
ability to determine the selectivity uh

699
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,639
so it's kind of a complicated answer but

700
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,399
I think the short of it is just trying

701
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:56,320
to understand a little better the

702
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,880
chemistry of this material and how we

703
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,519
can take advantage of that as well as

704
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,360
trying to really minimize the contact

705
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,799
our material makes with solvents and air

706
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,200
uh those are the main changes

707
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,679
here great so then there's another

708
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,360
question here from Chang sub uh which is

709
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,519
can you sweep through the frequency

710
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,000
wavelength the frequency or wavelength

711
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,880
of the photons to check the threshold

712
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,840
presumably as a way to kind of

713
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,840
understand the the material

714
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,559
um like for the detection I'm assuming

715
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,919
yeah that's what he means I think in in

716
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:40,000
theory yes in principle it's a little

717
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,399
hard just because you know you get your

718
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,960
Optics set up it's kind of optimized for

719
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,919
one wavelength um 1550 nanometers is the

720
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,639
longest wavelength that we have on site

721
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:55,279
um we also do some testing with 780

722
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:58,559
nanometers or even um UV I think like

723
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:02,200
440 or or similar nanometers uh but to

724
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,880
go much longer than 1550 I think the the

725
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,880
setup becomes a little more challenging

726
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,360
so it's something that in principle we

727
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,600
can do um but in practice uh it would

728
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,919
kind of be a full study on its own I

729
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,159
think to get the apparatus set up to to

730
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,919
perform an experiment like that it could

731
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,720
be worth it um but I think it's not what

732
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,720
we've been focused on so

733
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,399
far great um

734
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:37,679
one uh one we have a question from

735
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:40,760
pankar gusain who says in the magnetron

736
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,679
sputtering fabrication process there was

737
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,760
also a boron layer on top of the

738
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,200
Magnesium diboride layer what is the

739
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,399
purpose of

740
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,600
that um yeah so

741
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:57,159
the yeah go go ahead sorry so this

742
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,399
actually has to is is kind of an a

743
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:03,279
result of the way that the group at JPL

744
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,919
does magnetron sputtering um the Boron

745
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,000
layer on top is actually required to

746
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,440
sort of maintain the stability of the

747
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,960
underlying film and to maintain a a

748
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,440
smooth surface of the Magnesium diboride

749
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,000
uh while they uh they have to do a post

750
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,359
analing process to improve the

751
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,200
uniformity um it's actually a very

752
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,040
interesting technique where they sputter

753
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,399
these different layers alternating of

754
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,240
boron magnesium and boron and then they

755
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:35,079
anal it all together into the Magnesium

756
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:38,119
diboride layer as a result um they

757
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,599
require a layer on top to prevent

758
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,200
evaporation of different atoms off of

759
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:46,359
the surface I believe I might be uh I'm

760
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,520
paraphrasing this myself so I hope I

761
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:51,480
haven't um misrepresented the process

762
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,159
but I believe it's a sort of protective

763
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,160
thing for the various steps of their

764
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,640
sputtering

765
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,640
process great

766
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,359
all right well um thank you again Emma

767
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,079
for the very interesting presentation

768
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,520
and to all the participants for their

769
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,359
questions and attention um I want to

770
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,480
just uh before wrapping up uh mention

771
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,240
that the next uh Nano exploration

772
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,400
seminar is going to be on May 14th and

773
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,710
it's going to be given by jeppe Romano

774
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,160
uh from The Institute of

775
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,440
[Music]

776
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,200
nanotechnologies and this presentation

777
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,400
is going to be

778
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,079
um posted at the the Nano Explorations

779
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,359
website um after it's been edited and

780
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,079
captioned and so forth so with that

781
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:46,400
thank you everyone and uh let we'll U

782
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,599
end the

783
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,599
session thank you
