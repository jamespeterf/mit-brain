1
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,800
indeed uh it is tremendous uh to uh have

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,800
a chance to uh welcome the next set of

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,920
speakers uh led by Joyce swo uh who

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,560
manages the stard dot Nano program of

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,080
MIT Neno we have asked a set of

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,200
luminaries people we tremendously admire

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,239
to join us and Joyce please come on the

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,520
stage and tell us more about the next

9
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,160
thing we would like to tell you about

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,399
and that is how to transition deep Tech

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,559
from Academia to

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,559
Industry thank

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,399
you so the session today will talk about

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,879
how we transition an idea into

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,440
commercialization um strictly focusing

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,440
on deep Tech

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,240
investment into hardtech is only a few

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,520
percent by VCS and the journey for

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,280
hearttech is Frau with many

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,479
challenges an idea needs more time and

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,720
resources to reach commercialization to

22
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
become a product than one can realize at

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
the time of

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,079
inception ideas can be incubated within

25
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,200
a large company but most commonly they

26
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,720
are through a startup um and there are

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,680
many points at which a startup can fail

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,200
in its journey to to

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,360
commercialization first one needs to

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,119
find people who share your vision and

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,479
bring it to the Prototype or proof of

32
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,159
concept stage this is the first valley

33
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,439
of death

34
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:50,240
um the next stage to get to from

35
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,399
prototype to the advanced scaleup or de

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,799
Advanced element or scale up um is

37
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,520
another Valley of Death where you need

38
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,079
to find customers who see your prototype

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,840
your product um that can become a

40
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,840
product

41
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,520
that in this area you also need to find

42
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
the right market and the right solution

43
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,560
for that

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,920
customer then in the next Valley of

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,239
Death you have to find a partner or

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,200
investor who will Bank your idea to

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,760
commercialization these three valleys of

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,200
death have attrition at each stage and

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,599
really a successful Journey takes at

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,000
least 10 years or100

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,360
million so how can we help startups in

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,360
their Journey with our tool set at mit.

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Nano start. Nano is an accelerator

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
program to help fill in these gaps

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,120
startups Are Climbing this mountain of

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,760
hardtech and we can minimize their

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,800
needed funds by first giving them access

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,159
to existing shared facilities like mit.

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,640
Nano and actually giving them a discount

60
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,040
for the use of those

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,280
tools this allows them at that first

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,000
stage um from IDE prototype where they

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,920
don't need to build their own lab and

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,720
buy and have investment Capital to do

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,360
that and they can use our tools to build

66
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,640
that

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,840
prototype also in the next stage they

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,760
can continue using our tools for

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,599
development to reach those first

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,680
customers we have several startups in

71
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,400
our cohorts one is Citra um you'll see

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,840
in the startup exchange um they didn't

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,239
need to build their own lab um and their

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
seed round was actually more like a

75
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,840
series A because they were able to build

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,720
their prototypes at mit. Nano with less

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,519
capital and another example of a startup

78
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,959
is wicked smart they didn't when they

79
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,159
realized we have an immersion lab which

80
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,000
has a motion capture they realized they

81
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,720
didn't need to raise additional investor

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,159
funds to build their own motion capture

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,560
lab because they have access to the

84
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,560
immersion

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,239
lab so this is actually our cohort for

86
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,760
this year of in the start. Nano

87
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,720
accelerator program we have 13 startups

88
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,720
and Counting um and the acceptance rate

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,120
was about

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,280
42% uh you can see they actually

91
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,439
represent a large and diverse market

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,480
segments here a quarter of them are in

93
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,160
biotech and a quarter in climate Tech

94
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,239
and energy and a quarter in materials

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,880
this broad area allows that us to tap

96
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,880
into many areas of in the startup uh uh

97
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,240
startup

98
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,520
ecosystem and we can support them with

99
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,160
our diverse tool set at mit. Nano and we

100
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,840
actually even have a few software

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
companies because we have the immersion

102
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,479
lab so this is a glimpse of all the

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,160
startups that have been in start at Nano

104
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,400
since an Inception in

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,560
2021 um and some of them are here today

106
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,280
at the startup exchange uh startup sorry

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,199
startup showcase um and let's hear now

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,160
from our our upcoming speakers um about

109
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,800
their perspectives of how we bring

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
technology to

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Market so first we have Marina AIS um

112
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,800

countries investing in critical

165
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,960
Tech so now we'll here from

166
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,840
Marina talking about translating deep

167
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,759
Tech from to

168
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,319
Industry thank you hi uh great to be

169
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,720
here I'm going to talk to you about

170
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,800
translating deep Tech from Academia to

171
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,360
Industry and uh I'm going to make it

172
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,759
sound really simple like there are these

173
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,520
steps and you just follow them and then

174
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,360
you're good to go but it's not really

175
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,400
like that and it's not that clean it's

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,160
all kind of messy so uh I kind of broke

177
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
it down into these steps and I'll just

178
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
go through them really quickly so of

179
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919
course it all starts with research um

180
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,840
this is where there's an Innovative

181
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,919
scientific discovery um and the

182
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,039
researcher might have a general vague

183
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,840
idea of how it might be applied but

184
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,560
usually the application is somewhat

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,560
vague and that's fine um the important

186
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,560
thing is that there's something that

187
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,520
differentiates this technology from what

188
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,520
has come before the next is to patent it

189
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,280
and this is extremely important and I

190
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,000
can tell you from personal experience at

191
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,240
zc Corp um we had core patents for MIT

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,759
that actually blocked competition until

193
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
those patents expired um and that was

194
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,879
competition from HP so those are really

195
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,039
really important it protects you for 20

196
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,000
years from the date of filing and you

197
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,159
need those 20 years because it takes a

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,759
really long time to develop new

199
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:21,479
technology um but intellectual property

200
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:24,159
also includes Trade Secrets um and

201
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,280
knowhow and so uh it's important to

202
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,879
recognize those and protect those as

203
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,919
well the next step is publication and

204
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,760
generally professors and researchers are

205
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,519
incentivized to publish and this is

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,919
considered sort of an indicator of

207
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,200
innovation both for the individual as

208
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,240
well as for the institution um and

209
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
that's great to publish but just make

210
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,399
sure you get the order of events correct

211
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,360
you want to patent first and publish

212
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,480
later after you publish it's too late to

213
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,279
patent the next is the proof of

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,959
principle and I'm going to show you what

215
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,480
our 3D printer looked like when it was

216
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,800
at MIT it was not a pretty site um but

217
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,800
but the point was they had taken out the

218
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,760
magic they had proven that the

219
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,440
technology could work and that's what

220
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,839
you want to see um you want to get it to

221
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,880
a stage that there's no more magic

222
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,040
required and that straightforward

223
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,800
engineering can kind of clean things up

224
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,760
and make a reliable uh solution the next

225
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,680
is startup formation and it's really

226
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,839
important um to think about the

227
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,480
motivation for your startup why do you

228
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,079
want to do this um often times with a

229
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,680
researcher it's a passion for a

230
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,480
particular ular technology um it could

231
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,680
be to solve a specific problem or in my

232
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
case it was a desire to kind of solve

233
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,360
any problem and just kind of make the

234
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,160
world a little bit better um also

235
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Independence is a big factor this was

236
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,120
one for me as well like wanting to be My

237
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,399
Own Boss um the sense of teamwork and

238
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,680
community that comes with a startup or

239
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,320
making money and oftentimes it's all of

240
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,360
these or some combination of these

241
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,200
motivations but the important thing is

242
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,760
to understand your short-term and your

243
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,720
long-term goals are you just trying to

244
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,680
get it to a stage where you can sell it

245
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,839
or to scale it up to IPO um and make

246
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,480
sure that your goals are aligned with

247
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,079
those of your

248
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,839
investors one big mistake that I see

249
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:15,560
often is that the researcher the

250
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,560
professor wants to continue their day

251
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,880
job during the week and then do their

252
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,959
startup on the weekends and that doesn't

253
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,640
really work entrepreneurship is not a

254
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,839
part-time job researchers need

255
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,519
entrepreneurs entrepreneurs need

256
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,360
researchers it's a symbiotic

257
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,480
relationship of beautiful codependence

258
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,560
and it's really important to respect

259
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,800
what the other person brings to the

260
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,880
table the next step is understanding the

261
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,440
market so typically deep Tech research

262
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,399
um is a solution looking for a problem

263
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,120
and so to figure out what that problem

264
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,560
is requires customer conversations

265
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,200
charting the competitive landscape doing

266
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,320
research at trade shows reading articles

267
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,399
and reading annual

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,079
reports one of the mistakes I often see

269
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,240
is the lab is a comfort zone for a

270
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,079
researcher right and so it's always

271
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,680
easier to do one more experiment than to

272
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,000
get out there and find customers who you

273
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,680
don't know how to find them and you have

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,639
to have this awkward conversation

275
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,880
because you don't really know what

276
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,399
you're talking about yet um but it's

277
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,320
really really important to do that you

278
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,680
need to understand is the problem

279
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,839
painful enough how big is the market and

280
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,760
not to hold everything tight you can

281
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,120
retain your proprietary information but

282
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,880
still share enough information about

283
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,600
what you want to do in order to get

284
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,320
useful information from the market um

285
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,000
and really at the end it's only a real

286
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,360
product when someone will pay for it so

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,160
you need to understand um who's going to

288
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,000
pay for it and if they're

289
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,880
willing um obviously when you're doing

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,639
uh an Innovative startup you need to be

291
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,320
doing something different so you need to

292
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,839
learn what's out there and do something

293
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,360
different you can't the state of the-art

294
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,000
is not your end point that's your

295
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,440
starting point so yes you need to get

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,440
your technology there but then you need

297
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,800
to advance it beyond that and luckily

298
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,519
you have one big Advantage which is your

299
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,839
ability to take a market disruption or

300
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,440
create a market disruption and pivot um

301
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,880
and when you look at a large incumbent

302
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,320
they have everything right they have

303
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,040
customers they have money they have

304
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,880
experience they have distribution they

305
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,000
have manufacturing they've got it all

306
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,800
the one thing they don't have is the

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,800
ability to change course quickly and so

308
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,680
you've got to use that to your advantage

309
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,519
and typically that comes when there is a

310
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
market disruption it could be

311
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,920
regulations new regulations old

312
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,160
regulations that are going away um new

313
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,000
technologies that enable some other

314
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,959
technology things like that and so

315
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,600
that's what you always want to be

316
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,600
looking for but you're always making

317
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,639
decisions in the dark and so um and

318
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
that's good you need to move forward but

319
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,040
as soon as you get new information you

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,279
need to um remake those decisions and

321
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,120
that's why pivoting is generally part of

322
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,519
your daily

323
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,720
process the next is building a team in

324
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,079
culture and I'm very proud of what we

325
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,279
built at Z Corporation we had a very

326
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,000
diverse team of people with different

327
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,160
interests talents experience and we had

328
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,560
a very argumentative culture in a very

329
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,959
positive non-toxic way and I think this

330
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,920
allowed us to um make the best

331
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,199
decisions then you come up with your

332
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,040
plan product specifications value

333
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,800
proposition who's your customer how are

334
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,639
you going to find them um and the

335
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,320
biggest uh challenge I think of all is

336
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,720
finding your your product Market fit as

337
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,199
I said you're a solution looking for a

338
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,399
problem being different isn't good

339
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,160
enough you need to be substantially

340
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,079
better at something that the customer

341
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,399
cares about but the good news is you

342
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,839
don't need to be better at everything so

343
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,760
for example at zc Corp our parts were

344
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,240
not they did not have high surface

345
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,399
finish or high strength but our 3D

346
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,040
printer was 10 times faster than any

347
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,600
other technology and that was something

348
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,680
the customer cared

349
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,399
about then you get to fundraising um so

350
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,800
typically this starts with friends and

351
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,639
family then you go to Angels typically

352
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,600
Equity crowdfunding isn't so good for

353
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,360
this sort of thing government grants are

354
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,600
a great source of funding for deep Tech

355
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,759
and then obviously venture capital and

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,279
at a later stage not just Equity but

357
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,160
Venture debt um and don't forget

358
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,519
strategic investors these can be your

359
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,160
customers your suppliers anybody who has

360
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,759
a vested interest in your success and

361
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,639
that can be in the form of an equity

362
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,040
investment an R&D contract or what we

363
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,959
did is we asked for very High customer

364
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,160
deposits at the time of the purchase

365
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,880
order one big mistake I see is

366
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,120
entrepreneurs underestimating the

367
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,639
fundraising process it's a big job it

368
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,079
takes dedication time research and

369
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,360
energy you're faced with rejection and

370
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,000
failure every step of the way um but

371
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,000
it's important to take something away

372
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,800
from every meeting and learn from each

373
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,199
one was it the pitch or was it the

374
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,360
business get some strategic takeaways

375
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,920
don't waste those rejections

376
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,079
then you get to the minimum viable

377
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,759
product and this is something that

378
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,839
you're willing to show the customer and

379
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,320
you can see that our beta machine made a

380
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,800
lot of strides since that first proof of

381
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,759
principle at MIT and this was something

382
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,839
that we uh took to our customers so we

383
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,959
could get feedback from the market and

384
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,839
understand how we needed to iterate on

385
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,720
the design to get something that they

386
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,399
really

387
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,519
wanted one mistake I see is

388
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,040
entrepreneurs seeking Perfection but if

389
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,560
you wait until your product is perfect

390
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,240
you will have missed the market market

391
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,279
so you just need to get something into

392
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,560
the customer hands so that you can start

393
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,279
to get feedback because what you think

394
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,000
might be close but it's probably not

395
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,040
exactly right and so you need to get

396
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,920
that feedback and hear from them finally

397
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,680
you get to sales that's the exciting

398
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,880
part that's when you get money from the

399
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,680
customers um and it kind of validates

400
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,279
your business um but commercializing

401
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,480
deep Tech Hardware has some specific

402
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,680
challenges that make it much more

403
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,079
difficult than your software comrades um

404
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,839
you have manufacturing issues cost of

405
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,079
good sold that has needs to be

406
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,880
controlled quality control issues we had

407
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,600
to add six months to our development

408
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,040
cycle which was already two years long

409
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
um servicing equipment out in the field

410
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,959
uh which can be a huge challenge if

411
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,360
you've sold machines all over the world

412
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:24,000
generally the time and the cost that you

413
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,160
think is it's actually going to be about

414
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,240
three to four to maybe 10 times more

415
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,560
time and cost than what you originally

416
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,279
anticipate and because of this the

417
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,920
investors know this and so this makes

418
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:39,680
fundraising that much more

419
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,319
difficult when you're in the mck uh the

420
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,319
software uh the startup fog uh you have

421
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,880
too many decisions to make too many

422
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:51,040
directions to go in not enough

423
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,680
information and conflicting opinions so

424
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,959
your North Star always needs to be going

425
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,399
back to your core technology whatever it

426
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,680
is that you've patented and protected

427
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,800
how do does that create product

428
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,480
differentiation and now use that to help

429
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,520
guide you toward who is your customer

430
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,319
what Market are you going after um how

431
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,880
should you develop the product and where

432
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,600
should you really uh prioritize your

433
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,199
limited resources of time and

434
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,520
money um finally factors for Success um

435
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,600
are different uh defensible product

436
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,039
differentiation a strong diverse team a

437
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:32,559
healthy culture and lots and lots of of

438
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,559
customer interactions thank

439
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,720
you hello everybody uh Mark halfman

440
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,039
director of the Northeast

441
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,559
microelectronics Coalition I do want to

442
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,120
quickly thank Joyce for the invitation

443
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,200
uh I thought about this on the drive in

444
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,000
this morning Joyce and I first worked

445
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,240
together 16 years ago now at a early

446
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,640
stage mems based display startup so

447
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,640
thrilled to be able to join her today as

448
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,799
part of her panel um as we get started I

449
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,480
thought Vladimir had an awesome quote I

450
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,400
actually wrote it down um from his

451
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,000
kickoff this morning he had asked the

452
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,240
question how do Grand ideas reach the

453
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,440
world and so what I'd like to do you

454
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,919
know in the next nine and a half minutes

455
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,840
now is take you through a regional point

456
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,159
of view on that so from the Northeast

457
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,080
micro Electronics Coalition how do we

458
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,000
view that challenge and what are we

459
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,360
trying to achieve in an effort to help

460
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,080
startups innovators alleviate at least

461
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,080
aspects of that challenge

462
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,360
so uh The nmc Hub is a division of the

463
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,679
mass Tech collaborative uh for those

464
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,600
that might not know the mtech

465
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,919
collaborative has been around for 40

466
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,600
plus years now really focused on

467
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,799
strengthening the competitiveness of the

468
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,960
tech and Innovation economies in

469
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:54,520
Massachusetts uh we are one of now six

470
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,080
divisions within Mast te uh Innovation

471
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:01,000
Institute really focused on early stage

472
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,039
deep te clustering uh autonomous

473
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,120
robotics Quantum Computing uh other

474
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,480
initiatives of of that type of of size

475
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,440
and scope center for advanced

476
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,200
manufacturing really focused on how do

477
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,159
they bring industry 4.0 uh into

478
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,240
manufacturing across the board within

479
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:22,240
Massachusetts Broadband ealth cyber um

480
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
we are a bit unique within that

481
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,000
infrastructure and that although the

482
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,840
other five divisions are

483
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,840
largely Massachusetts funded

484
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,960
Massachusetts focused uh from a regional

485
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,720
perspective we the Northeast micro

486
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,120
Electronics Coalition are really focused

487
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,280
across the Northeast which for us is New

488
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
Jersey New York State uh and then

489
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,520
everything that we think of is the the

490
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,120
greater portion of New

491
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:51,440
England uh also from a funding

492
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,000
perspective we are funded through the US

493
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,400
chips and science act uh as I'm sure

494
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,039
everybody's aware us chips act $ 54

495
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,360
billion we've all seen the large

496
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,880
announcements

497
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,799
uh largely from the Department of

498
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Commerce funding tsmc Intel Micron Etc

499
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,559
what you might be less aware of is

500
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,679
within that 54 billion is a $2 billion

501
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,960
allocation being administered through

502
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,760
the Department of Defense specifically

503
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,200
for the microelectronics commons really

504
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,880
addressing uh that second Valley of

505
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,440
Death that Joyce referred to earlier in

506
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,240
her presentation so how do we really

507
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,760
help uh Innovative chips and chips

508
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,280
adjacent Technologies make it from

509
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,919
Innovative concept to something that's a

510
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,240
little more on its way to commercial

511
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,280
Readiness specifically from a

512
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,240
microelectronics Commons perspective

513
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,400
really focused around six key technology

514
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,520
areas that you see in the bubbles there

515
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,480
but really spreading a wide range of

516
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:56,480
applications from ew to secure Computing

517
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:59,640
on the edge AI Hardware Quantum 5G 6G

518
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,200
Technologies commercial leap ahead um

519
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,760
really could be called miscellaneous so

520
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,640
the catch all for everything else but to

521
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,240
put a better nomenclature around it

522
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,039
commercial leap ahead Technologies um

523
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,360
but again I think the key takeaway here

524
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,320
is is really how do we help bridge uh

525
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,000
that labto faab Gap if you will how do

526
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,159
we help bridge that value of death and

527
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
from a Northeast micro Electronics

528
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,880
Regional perspective for us that's

529
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,840
really about how do we help Innovative

530
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,279
companies uh Innovative Concepts really

531
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,600
regardless of where they're coming from

532
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,279
so whether they are coming out of

533
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,960
University Research whether it's an

534
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:39,960
early stage startup trying to get its

535
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,039
footing or even compelling ideas coming

536
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,400
out of large multinational corporations

537
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:47,919
that are similarly trying to figure out

538
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,080
uh how they take next steps um for us

539
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,840
that really means how do we help those

540
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:58,840
early Concepts whether it's at the white

541
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,279
paper stage whether it's a crude proof

542
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,480
of concept you know built out over a lab

543
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,600
bench something only an engineer could

544
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,360
love um I love Marina's photo earlier um

545
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,840
from her early proof of concept which is

546
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,520
exactly what we think of there um in

547
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,080
terms of you know an early stage proof

548
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,799
of concept but from a Northeast micro

549
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,960
Electronics Coalition perspective how do

550
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:22,760
we

551
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,559
help accelerate amplify um you know

552
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,240
continue to to move those types of

553
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,600
Technologies forward in what can be a

554
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,919
very different uh very difficult uh

555
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,520
investment environment as as Marina

556
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,520
spoke to as

557
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,520
well so from an nmc perspective

558
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,159
specifically uh we do see tremendous

559
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,480
power in the Northeast region I think

560
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,880
it's important to note that we the

561
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,919
Northeast microelectronics Coalition

562
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,200
don't staff our own team and design

563
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,440
Engineers we don't run a test and

564
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,279
characterization lab we don't have a way

565
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,320
for Fab so our strength really does come

566
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,240
from the capabilities the Capac ities in

567
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,120
the commitments of our membership and

568
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,320
you can see that referenced here um I

569
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,200
apologize I should also note uh we are

570
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,480
relatively new organization uh we just

571
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,480
celebrated our one-year anniversary last

572
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,840
month so I think this is tremendous

573
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,679
progress for now 13 months in to really

574
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,240
a brand new seat of an idea going from

575
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,919
initial concept to now 220 plus

576
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,000
organizations as members 780 plus

577
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,559
individuals within those organiz ations

578
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,919
as contributors you can see on the upper

579
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,720
right hand side it's roughly comprised

580
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,200
of 50% Massachusetts

581
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,440
organizations another 40% throughout the

582
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,799
Northeast and then the remaining 10%

583
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,480
really around the the rest of the US um

584
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,679
from North Carolina to California and

585
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,679
everywhere in between uh I think the

586
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,520
membership by category is also important

587
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,360
because again when we talk about how do

588
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,480
we

589
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:00,200
help these early stage Concepts get to

590
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,440
some level of commercial Readiness I

591
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,880
think it's important to note that you

592
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,000
can see the the breadth of membership we

593
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,159
have from commercial and Industrial

594
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,120
entities to startups academic

595
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,840
researchers other nonprofits and the

596
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,080
like which is is really important as we

597
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,640
as we work on how from an nmc

598
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,880
perspective uh do we become what we like

599
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,080
to think of as the central point of

600
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,840
curated collaboration how do we help

601
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,080
these innovators come together how do we

602
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,480
help mature the Technologies help move

603
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,000
them from early stage lab environments

604
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,960
to pre-commercial Fab to commercial Fabs

605
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,640
um as you can see uh the core facilities

606
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,640
that we help work with um really in

607
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:45,039
tight collaboration with MIT Nano MIT

608
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,520
Lincoln laboratory and then spaning the

609
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,760
other organizations that you see they

610
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,039
are referenced and from a strength of

611
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,039
our Network perspective uh you can see

612
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,440
our first year funding operations

613
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:59,039
funding through the Department of

614
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,600
Defense US chips Act reference there

615
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,320
roughly 20 million uh the vision is

616
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,320
roughly that order of magnitude funding

617
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,480
over the 5-year Horizon of the US chips

618
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,640
act but you can see in terms of real

619
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,760
value that we're bringing to the

620
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,279
ecosystem we've been able to leverage

621
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,080
that that investment uh 40 million north

622
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,080
of 40 million now in private thirdparty

623
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,880
co-investment uh we announced beginning

624
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,480
of this calendar year in conjunction

625
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,320
with MIT Nano uh Applied Materials and

626
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,440
the nmc Hub coming together to be able

627
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,320
ble to provide uh or invest in over $40

628
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,200
million of new 200 mm wafer tool

629
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,000
infrastructure into the MIT Nano

630
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,039
facility 40 million in Massachusetts

631
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,679
state co-investment into our initiatives

632
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,240
80 million plus in additional

633
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,799
Massachusetts capital grants and again

634
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,720
if you look at the overall

635
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,399
infrastructure uh within the Northeast

636
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,279
micro Electronics Coalition it's

637
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:54,000
multiple billions of dollars of of

638
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,039
regional assets that we're working to

639
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,960
again leverage um and and help from a

640
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,440
collaboration perspective to the benefit

641
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,480
of startups and other early Tech

642
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,279
innovators looking to make that leap or

643
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,279
bridge that Gap from from Lab to

644
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:15,200
fabrication and in closing what I wanted

645
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,159
to do was just share our uh you know

646
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,559
let's say an initial success story in

647
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:22,279
terms of what we're able to achieve

648
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:25,360
again with an eye toward becoming That

649
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,320
central point of curated collaboration

650
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,159
and that is another aspect of the

651
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,799
microelectronics Commons funding in its

652
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,960
first year went toward $270 million of

653
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,919
funding allocated across 33 projects

654
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,360
within the eight microelectronics

655
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,080
Commons hubs of which nmc is one uh this

656
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,000
is a project that started about a year

657
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,000
ago or a process that started about a

658
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,240
year ago uh an open call for

659
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,399
projects through the microelectronics

660
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,960
commons program resulting in the 33

661
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,720
projects that were awarded uh just last

662
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,159
month uh one of the announcements was

663
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,480
held here locally at MIT Lincoln Labs

664
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,200
announcing specifically for the

665
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,640
Northeast micro Electronics Coalition

666
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,960
$38 million for the first year of

667
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,880
execution on six different

668
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,520
projects you can see the names

669
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,960
highlighted there very brief

670
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,000
descriptions um of the Technologies but

671
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,360
I think the two key takeaways are

672
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,679
although you see just one University

673
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,000
UMass Amherst listed as a lead all six

674
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,159
of these projects are

675
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,240
multi-organizational team so all of

676
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,960
these projects have University

677
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,520
researchers involved all of these

678
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,240
projects have federally funded research

679
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,000
R&D centers involved um other startups

680
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,600
providing technology so these are all

681
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,720
teams of anywhere from six to a dozen

682
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,080
plus organizations coming together to

683
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,919
help these to help mature these IC based

684
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,840
Technologies and what I'll leave you

685
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,440
with um is really from the last bullet

686
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,480
not using it to highlight our successes

687
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,080
versus the other seven microelectronics

688
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,840
Commons hubs because we're all in this

689
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,760
together but really to highlight uh the

690
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,559
demonstrated success from the point of

691
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,919
microelectronics Commons really the vote

692
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,519
of confidence from the US chips act that

693
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,080
the regional power within the Northeast

694
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:21,360
micro electronics are 220 plus

695
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,399
organization members the way they were

696
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,480
able to come together to propose the

697
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:28,120
topics and receive more Awards than any

698
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,279
of the other hubs really is a testament

699
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,080
to the power of the region and what we

700
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,159
going forward look to continue to build

701
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,320
on whether it's to help collaborate in

702
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,880
network startups looking for commercial

703
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,039
support whether it be University

704
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,279
researchers looking for the connectivity

705
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,679
on how they grow outside of the

706
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,960
University research lab environment or

707
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:51,000
whether it be large multinationals that

708
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,120
see a gap in their road map and rather

709
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,960
than trying to address it internally or

710
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
having their own Tech Scouts go scour

711
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,559
the Northeast to understand what's out

712
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,679
there coming to us and and enabling us

713
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,799
to help them find the right technology

714
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,240
researchers the right startups and get

715
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,490
them to Market much more quickly from

716
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,650
that perspective as well thank

717
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,650
[Applause]

718
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,080
you

719
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,720
right okay thank you very

720
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,320
much I am acutely aware of the time

721
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,399
that's why I just want to make sure Vlad

722
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,360
what time are we trying to um joce what

723
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,840
time are we trying to finish now I've

724
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,320
got 10 minutes but

725
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,600
I I feel sure that other people use more

726
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,440
than 10 minutes and I want to keep you

727
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,519
on time because I know that when you run

728
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,880
conferences it's quite tricky and other

729
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,440
people have a lot more detailed

730
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
information to give you than I think I'm

731
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,519
going to um but I think my job is to

732
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,360
really talk a little bit more generally

733
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,640
and try and put what I see as the

734
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:55,080
extraordinary success of MIT Nano and

735
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,760
the huge success that New England the

736
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,679
Northeast Mast Tech collaborative has

737
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,640
had

738
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,840
microelectronics perhaps into a slightly

739
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,559
larger perspective and the way I think

740
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,880
about this is that the university has to

741
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,559
build a system that is going to support

742
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,720
the kinds of amazing invention and

743
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,799
Innovation activities that Marina talked

744
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,600
about and then we really really need our

745
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:19,200
ecosystem to kind of step in and to do

746
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,840
its job and you might say well why don't

747
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,200
we just sort of let everybody fend for

748
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,000
themselves and I think you've seen all

749
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,039
the good reasons both from the

750
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,320
perspective of the individual

751
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,039
entrepreneurs and Joy's image right of

752
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,320
those many valleys of death I always

753
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,000
thought we only had one and now we seem

754
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,080
to have about five and that seems quite

755
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,399
treacherous I suspect Professor bovich

756
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,200
that is your fault um that we have those

757
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,760
and then Marina sort of brought that to

758
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,279
life I think in this extraordinary way

759
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
with those pictures that I think

760
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,720
probably feel really familiar to so many

761
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,120
of us you know when any of us walk into

762
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,720
a lab we see something that looks quite

763
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,320
sort of chunky and clunky and

764
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,799
interesting and sort of Heath Robinson

765
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,200
and piece together and yet at the end

766
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,320
something extraordinary that transforms

767
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,480
how our industrial processes work kind

768
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,960
of comes out the end and I would argue

769
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,279
that it's because we have ecosystems

770
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,639
around us that that happens but before I

771
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,600
get to that I want to show you this

772
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:13,000
graph um so I had a debate about this

773
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,919
graph with my husband this morning he's

774
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,600
an engineer I showed it to him at 6 in

775
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,360
the morning and he was unimpressed but

776
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,440
I'm going to try and persuade you that

777
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,799
this is an interesting graph what this

778
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,240
shows us is something that blad and I

779
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,080
have taught about and talked about for

780
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,159
many years

781
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,960
basically trying to ask the question how

782
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,919
long does it take for an idea to sort of

783
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,360
have some important Innovative outcome

784
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,720
for an idea to go from inception all the

785
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,919
way through to impact and I think what

786
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,919
you've heard um already today and what

787
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,600
you heard from Marina was that it often

788
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,159
takes up to a decade and what this is

789
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,440
trying to do this graph it's actually

790
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,799
based on enormous amount of data

791
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,559
millions of data points is asked this

792
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,480
same question the gestation how long

793
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,279
does it take for an idea to get from

794
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,279
that stage of patenting all the way

795
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,519
through to something sort of sensible

796
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,799
what this tells us is it takes anywhere

797
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,880
from sort of a year or two all the way

798
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,679
to 10 12 14 years and what you might be

799
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,480
able to see if you squint at it is on

800
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,679
the left hand side the things where this

801
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,200
happens quickly happen in a couple of

802
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,559
years those are things that these are

803
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,200
all patent codes are Transmissions of

804
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,080
digital information that means this is

805
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,679
software and none of us should be

806
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,279
surprised that software kind of gestates

807
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:33,320
gets to impact in few years it's really

808
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,279
efficient on the other end we've got you

809
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,559
know production and refining of metals

810
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,080
methods of steam generation

811
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:42,760
gosh mining quarrying Fusion reactors we

812
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,080
shouldn't be that surprised that Fusion

813
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,000
reactors are all the way at the other

814
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,360
end and those ideas take upwards of 12

815
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,600
15 more years to actually come to

816
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,360
gestation somewhere in between somewhere

817
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,639
around 10 years if you look into the

818
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,360
data you'll find things like

819
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:00,600
semiconductors right um Quantum

820
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,440
Computing systems and so on now in the

821
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,440
middle of the distribution you get odd

822
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,279
categories like Dentistry I'm not

823
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,720
entirely sure why Dentistry is sort of

824
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,440
right at the middle of the distribution

825
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,880
but it is um and what this tells us is

826
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,960
that it really is some things just take

827
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,279
time and so what we know and the way I

828
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,919
think about this which is really

829
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:20,399
consistent with what we heard from um

830
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,840
Marina is that it takes time and there's

831
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,080
risk associated with Innovation

832
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,039
particularly in deep Tech things that

833
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,120
are physical right sort of physical

834
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,440
deeply technical instantiations of our

835
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,960
new ideas so the way I would talk about

836
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,080
this is that ideas that are based on

837
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,720
Frontier Science and Technology they

838
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,720
have significant technical Market

839
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,760
production regulatory risks associated

840
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,159
with them and those risks often cause us

841
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,559
to have these valleys of death we went

842
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,919
through some of that architecture that's

843
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,320
mostly associated with hardware and so

844
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,600
you will hear people particularly in

845
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,159
this room I think talk about hard tech

846
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,399
as opposed to sort of soft

847
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,320
Tech because I would bundle the life

848
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:00,600
science into this the word hard doesn't

849
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,000
always work for me and I sort of want to

850
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,799
say soggy as well and so then I'm trying

851
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,320
to work out what word to use but I'm

852
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,000
thinking about things that are grounded

853
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,240
in life sciences Material Sciences

854
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,320
chemical Sciences as opposed to narrowly

855
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,639
computer science ones and zeros

856
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,240
pitchbook talks about this as

857
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,399
Technologies based on tangible

858
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,359
engineering BCG calls them Technologies

859
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,040
of the future not sure that gets us very

860
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:25,359
far um the word deep Tech is a word that

861
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,280
is reasonably widely used up the road

862
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,839
our friends at the engine call it tough

863
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,240
Tech um but you know you'll find this

864
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,839
word around the place and what we really

865
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,480
mean are as I say things that are hard

866
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,280
uh that require very deep Wells of

867
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,520
capital and time to go all the way from

868
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,800
idea to impact at scale so how do we try

869
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,320
to reduce the time and reduce the amount

870
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,639
of capital because if we can do that we

871
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,480
can then ensure that more things happen

872
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,079
we have more impact on the world the R&D

873
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,520
dollars that we spend in our

874
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,800
universities in our economies go further

875
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,280
and so what can we do to either compress

876
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,920
the time or reduce uh the amount of

877
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,079
capital that's actually required well we

878
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,000
get a little bit of a hint if we start

879
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,079
to look at maps of where Innovation

880
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,800
activity particularly patenting Hardware

881
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:14,000
you know uh telecoms and Communications

882
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,960
is concentrated you can see that

883
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,640
Innovation activities are highly

884
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,760
concentrated that doesn't mean that

885
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,160
Talent is concentr doesn't mean that um

886
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,760
let's say creativity is concentrated it

887
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,040
means that Innovative activities are

888
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,560
highly concentrated and you can not

889
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,680
surprisingly they concentrated on the

890
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,960
west coast the East Coast an increasing

891
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,560
amount that we're beginning to see in

892
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,240
Austin and elsewhere around New York

893
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,720
this is a very uncomfortable political

894
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,560
reality and I could show you this for

895
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,200
any country but it is true and you might

896
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,200
say well why does that happen well I

897
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,240
think the reason it happens particularly

898
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,200
in this sort of deep Tech is because

899
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,240
when we're trying to reduce the risks of

900
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,240
deep Tech of these very complex

901
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,280
Technologies of that idea to impact

902
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,800
Journey we often do it by working in an

903
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,839
innovation ecosystem we do it by working

904
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,440
in a specific place where we can find

905
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,960
all the kind of supports that you

906
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,520
literally just heard all about right all

907
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,000
those support systems don't just sort of

908
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,520
appear and are evenly distributed around

909
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,400
the world they are not evenly

910
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,200
distributed across the US frankly

911
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,240
they're not evenly distributed across

912
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,599
Massachusetts and although we try to do

913
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,599
that they actually concentrate and so by

914
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,480
working in an innovation ecosystem one

915
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,400
of these concentrated geographically

916
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,280
bounded locations

917
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,440
when those ecosystems are rich in the

918
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,040
resources that entrepreneurs um need

919
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,839
like many of the individuals in this

920
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,119
room who you'll who you'll hear from or

921
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,440
have heard from what do they need you've

922
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,319
already heard what they need they need

923
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,400
the kinds of human capital the talent

924
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:46,359
and the expertise both to join their

925
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,400
team but also to help them in the form

926
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:50,800
of the extraordinary technicians that we

927
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,319
have at MIT Nano and elsewhere they need

928
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,400
funding and not just any old funding

929
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,920
they don't just need somebody with a

930
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,119
checkbook although that's always nice to

931
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,119
have they want expert investors who've

932
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,560
actually been through that Journey who

933
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,880
understand the kinds of Milestones the

934
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,640
pivots the iterative experimentation

935
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,480
that you heard about and they need

936
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,560
infrastructure and this I think is the

937
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,480
piece that we had underappreciated until

938
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,800
quite recently is how important the

939
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,280
infrastructure is because it's extremely

940
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,960
costly for any given company to do that

941
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,280
and so what we find in these special

942
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:25,520
places like Greater Boston like silic

943
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,520
and Valley um are a system of resources

944
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,000
that are rapidly shared in exchanged by

945
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,040
stakeholders who are in a sort of social

946
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,560
network who know how to find one another

947
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,560
so that each of you can do this sort of

948
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,319
quickly and what that lets you do is

949
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,880
reduce the time and money to building

950
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:41,200
your deep Tech Venture so the reason

951
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,319
then so for those things that take time

952
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,880
that have those Wells of risk that have

953
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:48,680
valleys of death that need to be filled

954
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,000
with money and infrastructure and talent

955
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,000
right we basically know that we can we

956
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,720
can fill those Wells we can cross The

957
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,560
Valleys of death much much more

958
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,359
efficiently if we are collocated with

959
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,000
other people who are doing it and we're

960
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,280
in these ecosystems that are providing

961
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,800
these sorts of resource systems to us

962
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,119
and so I'm not going to talk about that

963
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,480
very much MIT does a lot of this this is

964
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,319
my latest slightly mad bugle figure

965
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,079
which sort of says MIT has all these

966
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,760
things that are trying to help all of

967
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,880
you do this gosh there's a lot of them

968
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,880
sometimes probably a bit too messy but

969
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,200
more important than just what we do on

970
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,359
campus although MIT Nano I think as an

971
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,839
extraordinary additional resource that

972
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,880
now has been developed on campus is the

973
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,599
fact that in the ecosystem we have

974
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,280
stakeholders who are together

975
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,800
collectively providing those resources

976
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,640
and if I put myself in the shoes of the

977
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,640
many many entrepreneurial teams that I

978
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,119
work with in the School of Management

979
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,839
helping them get their ideas from the

980
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,119
lab out to the economy who do they need

981
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:46,319
to help them they need the university

982
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,520
providing that early stage

983
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,720
infrastructure like MIT Nano providing

984
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,680
the you know expert humans they need

985
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,760
risk Capital providers they're not

986
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,760
evenly distributed across the us or

987
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,720
economies they're often here in these

988
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,319
specialized places places but we also

989
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,680
need corporations and so partnering

990
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:05,560
having ILP here is really important

991
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,720
because large corporations have access

992
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,960
to Key Supply chains customer channels

993
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,000
they understand the regulatory

994
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,480
environment they often have the balance

995
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,800
sheet funding that can be particularly

996
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,520
helpful in Partnership and last but not

997
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,160
least we need the government you already

998
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,440
heard what the state of Massachusetts is

999
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,760
doing it's in the context of the chips

1000
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,560
act which is obviously the federal

1001
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,720
government but the government can be

1002
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:29,400
very very significant in supporting this

1003
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,400
expensive ecosystem wide infrastructure

1004
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,119
it can do things like provide funding

1005
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,920
everything from the SB and sttr to

1006
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,960
things like the vouchers that I know are

1007
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,960
extremely important in the semiconductor

1008
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,640
Arena at the moment and frankly they can

1009
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,800
serve as lead customers right when the

1010
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,920
government says they want to buy

1011
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,839
something from you like the next chip or

1012
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,520
the next um piece of quantum Computing

1013
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,880
that can be a very powerful thing for a

1014
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,240
startup so we need these five

1015
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,720
stakeholders to come together the last

1016
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,640
thing I'd say in my minus one minute is

1017
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,560
that I think that are some quite complex

1018
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,359
Global geopolitical dynamics that are

1019
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,079
shaping these things so we can't really

1020
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,040
sensibly talk about this without at

1021
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:09,359
least recognizing a few things one is

1022
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,640
within the US I think that there's

1023
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,760
significant potential to amplify the

1024
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,000
support for deep Tech um particularly

1025
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,119
deep Tech in Silicon in silico I don't

1026
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,280
mean silico Valley um we we are seeing

1027
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,520
this already in places like atin Arizona

1028
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,839
Oregon but we probably need to remember

1029
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,200
that this is not going to be evenly

1030
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,000
distributed across the US and we have to

1031
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,839
accept that as a sort of price of doing

1032
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,880
this kind of business that there are

1033
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,359
really important Partners beyond the US

1034
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,400
places that we can learn from and who

1035
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,280
want to learn from us and I would Point

1036
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,839
particularly in this uh domain to

1037
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,040
activity in Europe and places like Lan

1038
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,680
with iMac uh Copenhagen who are doing

1039
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,400
some extraordinarily interesting work in

1040
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,400
Quantum Computing not just in the very

1041
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,720
famed that rather sort of Gray Building

1042
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,760
is the Neils bour Institute not just the

1043
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,000
research but also the quantum Foundry

1044
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,200
Investments That Nova Nordisk is making

1045
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,560
and finally the geopolitical landscape I

1046
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,599
think means that we have to um establish

1047
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,520
greater control over the stages of

1048
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,920
innovation we need to think much much

1049
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,920
more carefully about our supply chains

1050
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,800
and frankly the US I think is beginning

1051
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,720
to make a shift from what has been

1052
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,480
described as a sort of small yard high

1053
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,920
fence kind of America you know putting

1054
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,760
everything in America that's I think a

1055
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,119
quite inefficient approach and you're

1056
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,480
beginning to see some very interesting

1057
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,359
movement towards what I would call

1058
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,920
shared Gardens which is engaging with

1059
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,359
allies and partners um so that we really

1060
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,040
think carefully about some of these

1061
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,119
Global Supply chains and pockets of

1062
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,560
expertise that can be networked together

1063
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,000
but that is probably a discussion for

1064
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,160
another day so with that Joyce thank you

1065
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,160
very

1066
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,750
[Applause]

1067
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,240
much thank

1068
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:56,079
you thank you to our three speakers that

1069
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,040
was an amazing um Talk many talks about

1070
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,720
the different aspects of bringing idea

1071
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,560
to fruition um and I'd like to invite

1072
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,359
our three speakers up for our panel um

1073
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:09,480
with questions um so we have um the

1074
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,960
pigeon hole where you can um put your

1075
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,920
questions and then people can upload

1076
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,640
them and we can ask do you want to sit

1077
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,640
these three and I'll sit here yeah

1078
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,400
okay so maybe to start um so you've

1079
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:26,520
talked a lot about startups um bringing

1080
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,160
um deep Tech into commercialization and

1081
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,359
there are many ways a startup can fail

1082
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,319
what are some advice or what kind of

1083
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,400
elements would you suggest would be ways

1084
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,000
to be a successful startup or bring an

1085
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,839
idea to

1086
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,800
fruition that's uh well it's a loaded

1087
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:44,680
question I would say uh the number one

1088
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,599
thing is uh startups fail because they

1089
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,319
run out of money and so uh always

1090
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,680
keeping an eye on cash and knowing where

1091
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:58,000
you are what your Runway is and um being

1092
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,280
on top of that is uh the top priority

1093
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,079
because if you run out of money it

1094
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,400
doesn't matter how great your idea is um

1095
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,559
it just goes away and you won't be able

1096
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,920
to advance it so it's sorry to it's sort

1097
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,599
of an uninspiring

1098
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,440
answer great yeah maybe building upon

1099
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,319
that I think you know given the time

1100
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,760
scales that we're talking about in you

1101
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,720
know let's call it deep Tech uh

1102
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,839
especially we're talking semiconductors

1103
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,760
or other technologies that require you

1104
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,599
know it's called a third-party Fab to to

1105
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,599
manufacture your

1106
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,240
devices continuing to focus not only on

1107
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,400
the technology development but also on

1108
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,559
your commercial or your customer

1109
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,760
development because as you move

1110
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:46,599
from small research facility you can

1111
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,520
turn all the knobs yourselves much lower

1112
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,839
cost the cost as you move forward from a

1113
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,359
commercialization perspective you the

1114
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,599
cost of moving from MIT Nano let's say

1115
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,000
to an MIT linoln Laboratories to a

1116
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,520
global foundaries can get exponentially

1117
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,880
more

1118
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,520
expensive they will also from the

1119
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,280
question of why should I support it why

1120
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,200
should I give you a discount why should

1121
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
I put my a team on it rather than some

1122
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,520
team that you know is perhaps less

1123
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,960
interested in in really seeing you

1124
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,160
succeed all comes from the corresponding

1125
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,839
customer PLL that you can bring it's one

1126
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,839
thing to just bring your technology to

1127
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,680
them and hopefully write a check that

1128
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,119
you can swallow and develop the

1129
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,599
technology but if youing a portfolio of

1130
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,640
tier one customers tier one clients

1131
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,640
whether they be commercial industrial

1132
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,400
government that highlight as soon as you

1133
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,880
can build this in this quantity I'm in

1134
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
as soon as you can get to this quantity

1135
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,640
I'm in it just unlocks so much more

1136
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,599
potential der risks so many aspects of

1137
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,920
that um that I think critical to move

1138
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:49,880
again not only your technology

1139
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,760
development plans but your customer

1140
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,160
development plans in lock step with each

1141
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,319
other the only thing that I might add if

1142
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,599
I may is just that I think failing is

1143
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,880
okay I mean yes if we didn't fail

1144
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,800
sometimes we wouldn't be taking enough

1145
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,240
risk no investor assumes everything is

1146
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,400
going to work and we sort of know that's

1147
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,880
true but it's hard to say that out loud

1148
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,599
so I think the the thing to do is to

1149
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,760
fail in a capital efficient way so that

1150
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,520
you set up the learning milestones and I

1151
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,119
think I you talked about this the kind

1152
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,400
of Milestones that journey and pivot can

1153
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,040
sometimes mean pivot to stop and so I

1154
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,800
think just being really um clear red

1155
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,520
about that is a very difficult thing for

1156
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,000
most teams and a very important thing to

1157
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,520
try to do yeah and very hard decisions

1158
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,880
have to be made then yeah and and I also

1159
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,480
agree about the customer fit like you

1160
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,240
also all of them you mentioned that um

1161
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,000
showing that you have customers really

1162
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,440
validates your your use case um okay so

1163
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,680
we have a question here um what's the

1164
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,040
best way to access Innovation that is

1165
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,160
coming outside the so-called Innovation

1166
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,359
hubs such as Boston and Bay Area um take

1167
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,640
the Midwest as a case example how did

1168
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,720
you yeah I mean I can at least take it

1169
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,599
from

1170
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,680
uh from a micro Electronics Coalition

1171
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,119
perspective um or micro Electronics

1172
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,640
Commons perspective so although there

1173
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,040
are eight Regional hubs that make up the

1174
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:13,640
microelectronics commons and although we

1175
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,520
are regionally distributed um not

1176
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,440
surprisingly fairly well aligned with

1177
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,440
the map uh that was shown earlier um but

1178
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,839
we aren't Bound by those geographical

1179
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,680
regions so even if you take a look at

1180
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,839
nmc for example about 10% of our members

1181
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,559
are from with outside the Northeast and

1182
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:33,520
I think specifically to the the

1183
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:36,640
questions some of those are startups in

1184
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,920
North Carolina uh one is a startup in

1185
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,200
Arkansas that you know frankly doesn't

1186
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,520
have access to their local resources

1187
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,280
wants to utilize the types of facilities

1188
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,880
that are available in the Northeast want

1189
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,160
to start to plug into some of the End

1190
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,440
customer opportunities that are

1191
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,839
available here and so they are more than

1192
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,680
welcome to join our organization and

1193
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:56,920
participate with the assumption that

1194
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,720
they're bringing valuable technology

1195
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,839
opportunities into the ecosystem so

1196
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,480
there are certainly those opportunities

1197
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:05,800
uh for folks outside the Northeast yeah

1198
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,359
I mean I do a lot of work in Greece and

1199
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,599
um it really doesn't take much in any of

1200
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:13,400
these ecosystems to get pretty plugged

1201
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:16,559
in pretty quickly um and showing

1202
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:19,359
interest typically some place that's

1203
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,040
sort of not one of the hubs they really

1204
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,319
appreciate outside interest and they're

1205
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,559
very delighted to sort of show off what

1206
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,359
they've developed and what you discover

1207
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,280
is that the difference between those

1208
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:35,480
non-hubs and the hubs is not the level

1209
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,559
of inventiveness um at all um what the

1210
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,960
difference is is generally the ecosystem

1211
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:43,119
that Fiona talked about uh that whole

1212
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,040
infrastructure and the overall culture

1213
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,079
of accepting failure and uh just going

1214
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:51,760
for it um so it's been really fun to see

1215
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:54,359
what's happening in Greece and um

1216
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,040
there's great stuff happening everywhere

1217
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:58,040
yeah yeah and I would just add that I

1218
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,359
think that it used to be so when we

1219
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,280
first started looking at this sort of

1220
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,200
whole idea of an innovation ecosystem it

1221
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,160
was just a Silicon Valley phenomena that

1222
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,720
everybody looked at people woke up to

1223
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,520
the idea that we do have such a thing

1224
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,480
here in Boston um particularly in the

1225
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,800
Life Sciences but I would say absolutely

1226
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,800
also in sort of hardtech and and

1227
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,559
semiconductors that we are definitely

1228
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,599
seeing the rise of additional hubs

1229
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,359
elsewhere in the country and I think

1230
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,559
that is being both supported by some of

1231
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,520
the government efforts that you've

1232
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,200
described as well as those efforts sort

1233
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,599
of to go with the grain and saying all

1234
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,000
right we see this concentration of

1235
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,760
activity let's say in Texas or Oregon

1236
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,920
and let's sort of go after that and I

1237
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,559
think you're exactly right we see that

1238
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,240
in Europe as well and and that's

1239
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,680
definitely so in the last 10 years if

1240
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,240
you had been going to Munich for a

1241
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,079
period of time you'd have seen

1242
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,800
reasonably little extraordinary large

1243
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:48,599
corporations and now you see an

1244
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,760
incredibly vibrant Innovation Hub

1245
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,559
particularly around things that sort of

1246
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,200
build on some of the traditional

1247
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,839
strengths that that you have there and

1248
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,480
so I think it's actually a um quite a

1249
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:01,720
positive outlook but connecting into the

1250
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,119
hubs that exist and and one of the

1251
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,359
points about these hubs is they are open

1252
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,160
and welcoming and I think that's really

1253
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,200
important and I think there are also

1254
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,640
hubs opening in the midwest um there is

1255
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,160
definitely one in Chicago on the life

1256
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,960
sciences yep and um and the start. Nano

1257
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,720
program itself actually accept starts

1258
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,640
from all over the country so we actually

1259
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,079
have some in one we just accepted from

1260
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,880
Atlanta um so that's the same case with

1261
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,359
the nmc I think they're actually were

1262
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,160
funded by the

1263
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,680
nmc um so let's see what the next

1264
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,319
question um what advice can you provide

1265
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,839
to Industrial companies to make

1266
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,440
successful and continuous relationships

1267
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,440
with deep Tech

1268
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:44,040
startups I'll kick it out I you know be

1269
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:46,400
open um as a serial entrepreneur myself

1270
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,559
one of the huge bizdev challenges is

1271
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,440
especially with a large industrial

1272
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,280
organization is who do you get you know

1273
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,319
how do you get to the right person you

1274
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,440
could spend months knocking on doors you

1275
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:01,559
know trying to get to the right person

1276
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,160
within the right organization to start

1277
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:06,640
to have the conversation that you're

1278
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,760
really looking to have um and so being

1279
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,280
open to startups helping

1280
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,200
them understand where that front door

1281
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,599
lies so to speak who can they connect

1282
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,680
with how do they get quickly to the

1283
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,520
right organizations and start to have

1284
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,520
the dialogues that that can really help

1285
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,480
form Mutual

1286
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,720
collaboration I mean so I've just

1287
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,559
finished writing a book about this

1288
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,200
subject I think

1289
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:31,359
with my colleague Phil Bud which I think

1290
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,960
is going to come out with MIT press in

1291
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,720
April although we haven't chosen a cover

1292
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,520
image so any suggestions most welcome I

1293
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,000
mean the the the advice that I like to

1294
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,040
try and give is to imagine if you're a

1295
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,079
large Industrial company to try to put

1296
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,760
yourself in the shoes of the deep Tech

1297
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,359
startup entrepreneurial teeth and if you

1298
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,960
try and walk in their shoes what you'll

1299
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,119
realize is that they are going through

1300
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,440
these Milestones they are trying to

1301
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,160
generate evidence of what what of what

1302
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,040
works they're trying to be Capital

1303
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,200
efficient time is not on their side so

1304
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,640
what that means is the thing that they

1305
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,240
probably don't want from you is your

1306
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,720
entire legal team to show up in their

1307
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,680
offices with you know a 200 Page

1308
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,559
contract and so I think sort of trying

1309
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,119
to balance you know the minimum viable

1310
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:16,240
paperwork for early relationships and

1311
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:18,440
conversations and to be respectful of

1312
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,599
that fact understand where the Deep tech

1313
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,240
company is on their journey and then

1314
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:23,920
really think carefully about how you can

1315
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,520
be a partner with them what do you

1316
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,079
actually want from them and what might

1317
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,760
they want from you

1318
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,799
again it's probably not the lawyers it

1319
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,359
may not be your HR department it might

1320
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,960
and it is your money sometimes but it's

1321
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:36,079
often something rather different I think

1322
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,680
which is your insights into Supply

1323
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,119
chains your customer right a contract

1324
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,240
right much much more practical and

1325
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,599
tangible I think yeah absolutely I mean

1326
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,640
I think there are infinite numbers of

1327
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,480
ways that you can mentor and advise

1328
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,280
startups and get plugged into the

1329
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,160
ecosystem through incubators and

1330
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,079
accelerators and workshops and shows

1331
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,559
conferences things like

1332
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,880
that and my previous where I worked

1333
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:00,559
previously we also did a lot of

1334
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,319
Strategic investment so that's where we

1335
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,680
provide a lot of ink kind um like

1336
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:07,640
Consulting and you know access to our

1337
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,240
supply chain so that kind of thing also

1338
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,760
really accelerates their development I

1339
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,280
think a startup we worked with said we

1340
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,680
accelerate them by two years because of

1341
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:20,319
our the gaps that we could fill for them

1342
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,040
yeah let's see what's next how can a

1343
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,200
us-based startup with Founders who are

1344
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:28,520
not in the US um contribute to the chips

1345
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,520
act and participate in any

1346
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,319
memc yeah Sor I was just rereading the

1347
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,839
question um in general just like

1348
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:39,119
everybody else does and I don't mean to

1349
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:42,079
be GLI about it but I mean you know we

1350
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:46,760
welcome ideas from everyone um although

1351
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:48,960
we're us chips act funded um or although

1352
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,760
a large significant aspect of our

1353
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,760
funding is us chips act uh we're not

1354
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,960
entirely us chips act focus our vision

1355
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,799
over the coming years is to to continue

1356
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,640
to grow um whether it's DOD applications

1357
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:04,880
non-government applications commercial

1358
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,920
applications what have you so I would I

1359
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,119
would advise don't um don't let you know

1360
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,520
the fact that you're a non us founder uh

1361
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,119
dissuade you from reaching out from

1362
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,119
having conversations from joining The

1363
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,799
Hub and and seeing how we can

1364
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,640
collaborate yeah I think that's right

1365
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:24,240
let's see L of what makes the US very

1366
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,160
special is that you have lots of people

1367
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,799
who are you know themselves born

1368
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,359
elsewhere or whose parents are born

1369
00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:31,960
elsewhere and you know which is I think

1370
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,760
the issue becomes visas I mean that

1371
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,960
becomes a very important issue and one

1372
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,280
that universities deal with I think

1373
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,480
different government organizations

1374
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,200
entrepreneurs find that quite

1375
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,200
challenging but important to deal with

1376
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,359
yeah I think one of researchers in the

1377
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,440
US are foreign born or something like

1378
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,720
that and like onethird of entrepreneurs

1379
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,520
are foreign born so it's um the numbers

1380
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,760
are work in your favor and um in terms

1381
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,040
of getting Government funding um I work

1382
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,480
with a startup that has raised millions

1383
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:04,079
of dollars of government grants and um

1384
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,079
the founders are all born outside the

1385
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,079
US so uh let's like this question about

1386
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,480
um collaboration what are the

1387
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,240
opportunities in the near-term for us EU

1388
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,640
collaboration on hardtech startups what

1389
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,359
would that look

1390
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,599
like I mean look I'm I'm happy to um to

1391
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:21,799
go first I I think that there are some I

1392
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:23,200
mean there are some definitely I mean

1393
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:24,880
there are lot of if you think about the

1394
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,640
ecosystem model I think there's lots of

1395
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,720
opportunities from one ecos to another

1396
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,079
and those the sort of fabric of

1397
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,720
collaboration I think often the

1398
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,640
universities are very good at that they

1399
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,480
have very long-standing relationships

1400
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,240
with for example European universities

1401
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:43,280
uh MIT has that with a number of major

1402
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,880
academic institutions um I think when

1403
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,000
you see large corporations they often

1404
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,680
have multiple locations I'm particularly

1405
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,319
struck in this field with a relationship

1406
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,599
with imch um who are in lva in Belgium

1407
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:57,359
but who who have a physical presence

1408
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,200
here so you see some very specific um

1409
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,680
organizations trying to help make this

1410
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,079
possible because we're in a global

1411
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:07,319
market um the US you know is is is

1412
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,920
complicated if you're looking as an ally

1413
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:10,720
of the United States from the outside

1414
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,359
looking in you're not quite sure you

1415
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,280
know how things are going to unfold and

1416
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,839
so what you see is a number of

1417
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,920
collaborative relationships that might

1418
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:20,799
happen with the US on a country bycount

1419
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,119
basis the UK is seeing that partly

1420
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,000
because the UK is not in the EU anymore

1421
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,720
um and then the sort of us EU and I

1422
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,119
think particularly there's a a sort of

1423
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,359
interesting tension around the EU having

1424
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,119
its own chips and sort of thinking of

1425
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,240
itself as entirely separate because they

1426
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,119
want European sovereignity over certain

1427
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:40,000
things um the US wanting the same thing

1428
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,400
and then at what point do we collaborate

1429
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,720
I think we've seen extraordinary

1430
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,400
collaboration particularly with the

1431
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,039
Dutch with companies like asml you know

1432
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,839
sort of acting as that ful Crome where

1433
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,359
you have to have the collaborative sort

1434
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:53,119
of architecture to help us and and NATO

1435
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,720
has been part of those conversations as

1436
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:58,240
well because some of this is so

1437
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,240
important for Global

1438
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,720
security see what distinguishes between

1439
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:10,079
a deep Tech startup focus on

1440
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:14,000
differentiation versus new efforts like

1441
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,000
uh SpaceX and earling that create a new

1442
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:24,440
market um well I will say Nur um nurlink

1443
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,680
there are um other researchers and

1444
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,000
companies that have started that have

1445
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,760
been doing that for 20 years so nural

1446
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,960
link is just more like a big um

1447
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,720
promotional thing that like as if this

1448
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,880
is brand new but it's not at all brand

1449
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:41,319
new um so um in terms of what

1450
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,960
distinguishes um I think you're always

1451
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:46,160
trying to find a hole in the market so I

1452
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,400
wouldn't really view those as being

1453
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,920
different um there's always a market out

1454
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,880
there and the market might be doing

1455
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,319
nothing or it might be doing something

1456
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,240
different um but you're always as an

1457
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:59,599
entrepreneur looking for that whole

1458
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,760
what's what's the need that's not being

1459
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,440
met by the current Solutions even if the

1460
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:08,799
current solution is doing nothing um and

1461
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:11,880
so um I would say um you're always

1462
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:14,640
looking to differentiate and um and

1463
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,720
create a new market Niche however big or

1464
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,400
small that Niche may

1465
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,319
be any other distinction I would make is

1466
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,559
actually whether something is so new

1467
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:25,000
that it's not clearly regulated I me

1468
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:27,640
that would be I think a useful

1469
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,440
distinction um

1470
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:32,039
in the sense of if you're trying to

1471
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,280
forge something that's so distinctive in

1472
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:35,520
the way you do something that the

1473
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,640
regulatory path is really really unclear

1474
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,119
I think that just lays on an additional

1475
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,920
layer of complexity and uncertainty and

1476
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:44,240
so you know some of the very early

1477
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,880
activities and say autonomy you know was

1478
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,319
completely unregulated and nobody really

1479
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,799
knew what you were allowed to do and

1480
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:52,079
nobody knew how to test it either and so

1481
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:53,680
I think that just adds but that's I

1482
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,319
think that's different than a new market

1483
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,119
it's sort of is it in such a new way

1484
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:58,880
that we don't have to Reg at it just

1485
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,400
make would makes any investor have more

1486
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,000
of a headache I think than we did before

1487
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,359
but I think it is a good point and you

1488
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,760
agreed it shifts it from the market side

1489
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:10,079
let's say to the underlying enabling

1490
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,480
technology side but I think there can be

1491
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:16,920
a differentiator on that technology

1492
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:20,280
side one of which would be if you're

1493
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,160
building within an exising technology

1494
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:26,000
set or on an existing technology

1495
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,559
platform your path to Market from which

1496
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,599
is to say a testing characterization

1497
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:32,480
perspective is going to be fairly well

1498
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:36,400
known you know you know what your you

1499
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,760
know what your you know HT your high

1500
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,960
temp operating life requirements are

1501
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,960
going to be you've got those models you

1502
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,359
know how to apply them versus if you're

1503
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,280
building from a brand brand new

1504
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,160
technology platform where that physics

1505
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,160
might not yet be understood those

1506
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,480
failure mechanisms might not be

1507
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,520
understand you do now have another set

1508
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,520
of hurdles to overcome to get to Market

1509
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,240
which is to one understand what they are

1510
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,640
and then to demonstrate that you

1511
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,200
understand what they are so that from a

1512
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,359
technology adoption perspective the

1513
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,359
customer is willing to take that

1514
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:06,359
incremental risk in theory for the

1515
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:08,640
incremental reward that you're giving

1516
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:11,160
them in return yeah I think to Compound

1517
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,440
on that um the more Innovative your

1518
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,039
technology the longer it takes to

1519
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,079
educate your customer on your solution

1520
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:22,000
and um I mean in our early days nobody

1521
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,839
knew what a 3D printer was and so you've

1522
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,640
got to start at Ground Zero like why

1523
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:28,039
would you use a 3D printer what's the

1524
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:32,039
benefit yeah it's cool and sexy but does

1525
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:33,920
it really matter um and yeah yeah and I

1526
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:35,839
mean I remember I mean every class that

1527
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,200
Dad and I have taught I think V Vladimir

1528
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,160
you know what I'm going to say which is

1529
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,839
that you know there are times when you

1530
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,520
say well if I'm developing it I've got

1531
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:44,160
new technical risk I don't quite know

1532
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,880
how this is characterized there's new

1533
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,960
markets new regulation which I just

1534
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,799
described but sometimes it's not even

1535
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,079
The Foundry doesn't exist right we don't

1536
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:52,799
actually know how to manufacture

1537
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:54,559
something and so I actually have to

1538
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:56,960
invent an entirely new manufacturing

1539
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,480
process as well and so when you compound

1540
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,520
each of those things you end up with

1541
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,240
more and more risk that you're carrying

1542
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,520
um I think makes it more

1543
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,160
complex definely so I think that was the

1544
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,680
last question um thank you for all your

1545
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,400
questions um and we're all going to be

1546
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,720
here for or some of us are going to be

1547
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,599
here for today so um thank you very much

1548
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,760
for our speakers today and the great

1549
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:20,559
panel um and so here is our startup

1550
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,920
showcase um in the Next Room um so we

1551
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,839
have a few selections from our current

1552
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,960
cohort and some previous cohorts so

1553
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:30,000
please check them out out um and I guess

1554
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:34,319
it's time for lunch and thank you again

1555
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,319
so much thank you great talk
