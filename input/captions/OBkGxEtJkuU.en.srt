00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,790
ILAN MOYER: When you see machine
learning in popular culture,

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,130
it's very abstracted.

5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,540
And you have the sense
that there's something

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,080
very complicated going on.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,290
And this class has
opened the curtains.

8
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,950
FAEZ AHMED: When we
started the class,

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,240
I showed off our best
text-to-image generator

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,940
of a group of elephants
walking in muddy water.

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,760
If you look at
that image and you

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,580
look at the one from
2022, 2023, 2024,

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,292
you can quickly see how
fast the field has evolved.

14
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:32,000
LYLE REGENWETTER:
There's a lot of reason

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,380
for mechanical
engineers to think

16
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,950
about machine learning and AI to
essentially expedite the design

17
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,800
process.

00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:41,660
EM LAUBER: Artificial
Intelligence

20
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,520
and Machine Learning
for Engineering Design

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,940
is a course that takes
machine learning and AI theory

22
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,770
and applies it to real-world
engineering design.

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,100
CECILIA ZAGARA: I think my
favorite part was probably

24
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,430
the challenge problems.

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,597
ILAN MOYER: They gave us starter
code, which gave a solution.

26
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:57,930
But it wasn't the best solution.

27
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,720
And our task was to--

28
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,870
OK, how can we do better?

29
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,537
MALIA SMITH: The first
challenge problem

30
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:04,879
was building a
linkage mechanism that

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,960
would trace a certain shape.

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,180
It was primarily an
optimization problem.

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,730
CECILIA ZAGARA:
We had bikes that

34
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,140
had a certain portion
of the bike hidden.

35
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,828
And we had to figure out the
missing portion of the bike.

36
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,620
LYLE REGENWETTER: And
we tried to set it up

37
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,020
in a sort of
friendly competition

38
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,270
so that students can try
out different approaches

39
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,150
and compete.

40
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,550
ILAN MOYER: And so they
were very engaging.

41
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,967
I didn't realize
how competitive I

42
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:28,840
was until I worked on some
of these challenge problems.

43
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,660
FAEZ AHMED: It is really
important for our engineers

44
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,780
to know AI and machine learning
and optimization methods.

45
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,030
CECILIA ZAGARA: There's
coding in everything nowadays.

46
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,270
And this class,
while the product

47
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,850
was for engineering
design, whether it

48
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,290
was bike frames or city grids,
it all also came down to coding.

49
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,320
EM LAUBER: So it really
gave me the space

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,450
to explore the application
of what I had learned

51
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,010
and the practice skill of
literally how to code it.

52
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,170
MALIA SMITH: The best part
about the final project

53
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,590
was that it gave every
student the opportunity

54
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,170
to apply what they've learned
in the class to an area

55
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,640
that interests them a lot.

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,889
FAEZ AHMED: I think
it is always amazing

57
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,272
what our students can do.

58
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,980
EM LAUBER: My final
project for the class

59
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,040
was taking a framework
of a cat tree design

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,430
with different modules of poles,
platforms, ramps, and then

61
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,250
developing a utility
function to evaluate

62
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,230
these cat trees to customize
it to the cat household.

63
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,610
ILAN MOYER: I created software
that is designing a new type

64
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,750
of 3D printer architecture.

65
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,860
MALIA SMITH: I chose
markered motion capture data

66
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,310
and looked at predicting ground
reaction force of runners

67
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,180
and seeing if we could
predict that force.

68
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,722
And it was really gratifying
because it worked so much better

69
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:42,280
than I thought it
was going to work.

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,960
FAEZ AHMED: When people think
about mechanical engineering,

71
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,680
they're thinking about
hammers and hardware things.

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,110
But mechanical
engineering is very broad.

73
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,330
And within mechanical
engineering,

74
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,100
the aspect of machine
learning, AI optimization,

75
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,952
is playing a big role.

76
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:01,160
CECILIA ZAGARA: In the
environment we're moving into,

77
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,535
it is definitely
going to be very

78
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:04,190
foundational to our society.

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,850
And I think getting
an understanding of it

80
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,040
is very valuable.

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,790
ILAN MOYER: I think
of my grandmother, who

82
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,890
really resisted the
computer and eventually used

83
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,680
it to write books.

84
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,180
But it took her a long
time to get there.

85
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,763
And it feels like, OK, this is
another one of those inflection

86
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,600
points.

87
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,360
And do I want to
be the person that

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,777
is kind of stuck in
the past, or do I

89
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:23,110
want to at least have open eyes?
