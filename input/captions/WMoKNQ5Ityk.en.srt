00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
How does the brain give rise to the

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,640
mind? To answer this question, we need

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,240
to start with the mind. If we're going

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,080
to understand how does this thing

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,000
produce a mind, we need to first figure

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,160
out what is a mind. Last year was the

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,599
first time I taught this course. So in

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,760
my valves, student 50458 offered this

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
comment. This class was not sold in the

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,560
correct way. It should not be called the

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,240
human brain because it was basically

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,760
just a cognitive science, not a brain

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,359
class. I expected to learn very

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
different material. So I don't know who

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,519
the student is. I wish I could apologize

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,519
to them, but I will say to you, sorry I

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,280
didn't make that clear. The fundamental

18
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,600
reason the brain is cool is that it

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,440
gives rise to the mind. And that means

20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
that studying, you know, the biological

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,399
properties of the brain without

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160
considering the mental functions it

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,600
implements, it would be kind of like

24
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,280
trying to study the physical properties

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,680
of a book without considering the

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
meaning of its text. So, we're going to

27
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,320
spend a lot of time doing cognitive

28
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,800
science in here.
