1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,760
I'm David Newman the director of the MIT

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,880
media lab and the Apollo professor of

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,840
astronautics also affiliated with our

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,559
Harvard MIT health science technology

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,960
program I've been at MIT for three

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,480
decades and it's really my home and

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,840
family here at the media lab we're all

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,840
about imagining and then

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,519
inventing a better future a more just

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,239
future a creative future it needs to be

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,800
by with and for all we're really an

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:37,040
amazing ecosystem uh kind of a micro

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,120
ecosystem of MIT where we have artists

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,200
and designers Engineers scientists and

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,320
guess what we're all within the same lab

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,680
and so it really is

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,960
transdisciplinary and really what we're

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,879
about is again imagining that that

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,199
future that better future for all needs

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,920
to be by with and for all how do we do

21
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:00,719
that through inventing actually new

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,760
fields

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,400
uh for example maybe computational

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,400
social science or affective Computing so

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,200
thinking about the Long Haul of a very

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,520
optimistic view for people and the

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,560
planet everything we do is human

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,439
centered

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,960
design so thinking about our

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,000
transformative Technologies but also

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,400
experiences and in the future these

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,040
systems that really help people maybe

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,360
reimagine and redesign their lives

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,320
we're really excited um about the future

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,880
uh we have that's our vision our mission

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,759
and then shared Valu so we work very

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,720
closely with industry and our members

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
and it's really important that uh we all

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,560
strive for excellence uh making sure

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,079
that our inventions and our ideas are

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,280
shared shared as widely as possible

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,640
that's when we know we've gotten it

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,840
right we do um we do bet on the future

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,079
so we bet on those moonshots and how can

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
maybe some of our transformative

46
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,520
Technologies really have the most

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,119
societal impact so recently we've gone

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,000
through your strategic foresighting to

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,599
really take a look 10 maybe 20 years out

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,959
what's potentially the most societal

51
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,840
impact given our strengths of the media

52
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,840
what can we help shape what can we work

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
together with our industry partners and

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,920
our philanthropists and Founders that

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,599
really have that view into this future

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,959
this inventing that future that we all

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,760
want to see so for example um terms of

58
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,640
looking at the future of AI for us it's

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,920
Ai and The Human Experience all of our

60
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,599
AI tools all of our generative tools

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,400
they necessarily need to be enhancing

62
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,640
The Human Experience whether it's

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,560
education whether it's Health Care this

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,440
is really foundational and fundamental

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
to who we are at the media lab always

66
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,480
designing to enhance that Human

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,800
Experience so Ai and The Human

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Experience is really uh foundational for

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,400
the whole for the whole Lab we grew up

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,280
also Foundation educational but what

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
kind of education and creativ are we

72
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,000
talking about we're talking about making

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and doing with your hands so we're

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
talking about cultivating creativity

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,760
bringing out the best in everyone and a

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,959
lot of times uh you need to play that's

77
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,319
by being in a maker space that's by

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,560
working across the table I'm a rocket

79
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,840
scientist I need to work with an artist

80
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,120
and a designer maybe a geneticist

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,879
because when we think about bringing out

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,120
the creativity and education that will

83
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,560
really stick constructionist education

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,280
we do a lot of that Hands-On we do a lot

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,560
of that uh by play we do a lot of that

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,680
in groups of course and PE instruction

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,200
kids te teaching each other and scratch

88
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,439
is one of our you know really famous

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,000
contributions and when we can scale that

90
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,720
to over a 100 million users then we know

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,799
we've gotten it right so coming out of

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,400
the pandemic we're really bold and

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,640
bullish let's say on let's cultivate

94
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,519
creativity we think there needs to be a

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,040
new Revolution of creativity for all and

96
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,840
so that really speaks to some of the

97
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,120
energy the passion we have in terms of

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,120
of education and creativity here at the

99
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,799
media lab working with others how can we

100
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,879
how can we spread

101
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,519
that we're thinking a lot about the

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,480
planet I call spaceship earth um how do

103
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,560
we think about climate sustainability

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,160
from the media lab's perspective we have

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,000
a really bold Vision it goes from oceans

106
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,800
to land or Urban cities all the way to

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,680
space because today more than 50% of all

108
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,320
the climate variables are measured from

109
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,720
space looking down on Earth and let's

110
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,440
start with the ocean such an important

111
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,479
subsystem we've invented Internet of

112
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,160
things for the oceans without batteries

113
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,000
so now sensors you can measure monitor

114
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,720
we still have 95% of our oceans to

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,639
measure and monitor it's really

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,440
important when we think of biodiversity

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,000
and the role that the oceans play in

118
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,160
climate and keeping us Humanity in

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,360
balance with nature then we go to our

120
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,280
cities uh we all want to thrive and

121
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,720
flourish we really have to take a look

122
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,759
at the urban cities how can we um

123
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,080
redesign how can we think about that

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,919
next uh potential disaster that's coming

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,919
whether it's flooding and fire and uh we

126
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,520
believe in um really bringing in all

127
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,960
constituents all stakeholders whether

128
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,160
it's the the mayor the teachers the

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,759
educator and working literally around

130
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,160
the table we show a lot of Digital Data

131
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,800
about the cities and City Planning but

132
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,919
we all would love to live probably

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,520
closer to where we work and have good

134
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,039
food and have social you know Green

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,680
spaces to to live and play in so our

136
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,880
City Science group really looks at these

137
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,800
uh simulates them we run a lot of

138
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,080
simulations test B we work with cities

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,360
all around the world because there's

140
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,560
Solutions there's different solutions

141
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,560
for any place you live
