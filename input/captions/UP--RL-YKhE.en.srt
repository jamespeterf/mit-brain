1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,160
So

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,279
next we will so we we're switching away

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,960
from metric basis and we talk about

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,359
differentiation.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:27,880
So if we have a function

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,880
uh on R say

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,800
uh and then we say that

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,160
that uh that x that f is differentiable.

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,039
at x0. If the limit here

10
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:07,680
if the limit uh f ofx minus f of x0 if

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,680
the divided by x - x0 if this limit here

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,680
exist

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:19,000
um if this limit here exists

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,000
as x go to x0

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,880
this here This here this quotient here

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,880
is usually called the difference quotion

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,880
and it's always of course when you form

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,560
this different quotient it's always

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,320
assumed obviously that x is not equal to

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,759
x0 so that the denominator makes sense

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,640
right so if this limit here as x go to

22
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,240
x0 if this exists then we say that the

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,840
function f is differentiable at x0 and

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,040
the limit is called the derivative of f

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,040
at x0 and this is how it's denoted.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Okay.

27
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,959
So now

28
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,200
the simplest possible example of this

29
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,840
would be

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,760
uh that suppose that you're looking at a

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,520
function that is constant. of f is equal

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,520
to f for some constant

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,360
uh c

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,319
uh then if you're looking at this

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:43,440
difference quotient so f of x - f of x0

36
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,560
x - x0

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:53,360
well the value at any point is c so this

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:55,280
here is c minus c / X - Y X 0 and so the

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,319
denominator is zero. So this whole thing

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,720
is zero and so of course the limit this

41
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,680
is zero for each X

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,920
and also it takes zero. So in particular

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,519
of course the limit here exist. So the

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:14,760
limit here of the different quotient

45
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,760
uh exist

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,200
and it's equal to zero right because

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,120
it's zero for all x for a given x0.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,959
So that would be like the simplest

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,000
possible example. The second simplest

50
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,560
example, second most simple example

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,159
would be that you're looking at a linear

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:44,159
function. So let's say that f ofx is

53
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,239
equal to x, right? In this case, the

54
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,440
difference quotient.

55
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,440
So the difference quotient here,

56
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,000
well this here is x.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This here is x0.

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,959
So this here is for each x and x0. This

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,599
is one. So the limit of course in this

60
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,599
case also exist.

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,280
The limit here exist and it's equal to

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,280
to one.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Right? So in this case, so in this case

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,000
f is differentiable

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,440
at all points and the derivative at all

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:45,240
points is equal to zero. In this case, f

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,240
here is also differentiable

68
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,320
and the derivative at all points is

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,320
equal to one.

70
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,880
Okay. So now in general how do we

71
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,000
compute the so how do we compute the

72
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,000
derivative of a function?

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Uh how how do we

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,560
compute the derivative

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,560
and for that there are some some basic

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,880
uh laws how to compute it. So there's

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,880
these laws

78
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,919
um the sum rule

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,479
uh what's usually called the liess rule.

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,639
uh the quotient rule

81
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,120
and then uh also the chain rule.

82
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,280
Okay.

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,240
Now let me uh look at the first three

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,160
rules first.

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:27,440
So um

86
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,759
I have uh two functions f and g they are

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,800
defined say on r but it could have been

88
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,720
a subset of r

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,280
uh and uh I'm assuming that that they

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,319
are both

91
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,400
and both

92
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,080
right actually I need we'll need one

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:53,880
okay so both Um

94
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,880
f and g are differentiable

95
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,120
at x0.

96
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,599
Then we have the following. So we have

97
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,599
the following lema.

98
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Uh

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,240
uh one is we have that. So one and this

100
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,240
is really the sum rule.

101
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,479
We have that the sum here f plus g. So

102
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,240
the sum of these two functions this is

103
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:50,800
the function that is just in x is just a

104
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,960
sum of f ofx and g of x. We have that

105
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,199
this function here

106
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,199
f + g is differentiable

107
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,520
at x0

108
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:13,360
and the derivative f + g. The derivative

109
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,360
of this nx0 is just a sum of the

110
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,360
derivative.

111
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Okay,

112
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:35,240
let me let me prove this one here right

113
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,240
away. So let me

114
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,399
so let's prove this.

115
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,240
So we have the sum. So uh we we will we

116
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,760
are going to look at so we form the

117
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,760
difference. So form the difference

118
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,760
quotion.

119
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,680
So f + g

120
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,920
at x - f + g

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
at x0

122
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,920
x - x0

123
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,680
right so now what is this? So this here

124
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,800
is

125
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:30,480
uh this is just f of x plus g of x

126
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:35,680
minus and then f of x0 plus g of x0

127
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:38,080
and then divided by x - x0 right

128
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,880
and so then you can split this up into

129
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,760
two. You can write this difference

130
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,680
quotion as if you split it up. If you

131
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,880
collect the fs in a nominator.

132
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,880
So I just collect the fs

133
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,640
and then afterwards I collect the and I

134
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,160
put it on two different fractions.

135
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,160
Separate them out and then I collect the

136
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
G's.

137
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,680
And now you see that because f was

138
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:24,079
differentiable at x0 this thing here as

139
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:28,720
x go to x0 this here goes to fprime. So

140
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:31,279
this here goes to f prime of x0. This is

141
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,760
what this difference quotient here. And

142
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,360
this difference quotient goes to g prime

143
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,399
of zero. So you have that indeed it does

144
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,440
converge and this is what it converts to

145
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,959
right and so this prove that the sum of

146
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
these two functions is also

147
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,800
differentiable and their derivative is

148
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,720
the sum of the derivative okay the next

149
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,240
thing we will prove is len rule but

150
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,920
before that I need to kind of step back

151
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,000
and I want to so before proving so the

152
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,800
next uh maybe I'll just state it and

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,240
then we'll go back and we need something

154
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,240
The next is what's called liveness rule.

155
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,040
So it's all you know you could also call

156
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,720
it product rule but it's really quite

157
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,600
generally called the lieness rule.

158
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,320
And so this is when you looking at the

159
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,399
product of these function. So the

160
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,360
product function,

161
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,279
the product function is a function in x

162
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,440
that is just the product of f ofx and g

163
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,440
of x

164
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,800
[Applause]

165
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:49,640
and lightness rule.

166
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,640
Lightness rule it say the following

167
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,800
that if f and g are differentiable at x0

168
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,480
then the product of these two function

169
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,320
here

170
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,920
is also differentiable at x0.

171
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,360
And the derivative of the product is the

172
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,160
derivative of the first function at x0

173
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:20,320
times the value of the second function

174
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:24,800
at x0 plus the uh the symmetric in f and

175
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,880
g which is the value of f at x0 times

176
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,920
the derivative of g at x0. Right? So the

177
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,160
product is differentiable at x0 also.

178
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,399
And this is what the derivative is. And

179
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,040
in the notes, I just copied a little bit

180
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,800
of thing just for fun from Wikipedia

181
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,959
about lightnings. That was kind of

182
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,560
interesting figure and played an

183
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,519
important role long time ago.

184
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,120
Okay. So before I want to prove this,

185
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,519
let me step back and let me make an

186
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,680
observation about

187
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,040
um

188
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,279
uh what it means to be differentiable at

189
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,279
a point.

190
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,800
So So this is the next lemon.

191
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,880
So you have a function f

192
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,880
on r into r

193
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:32,200
and and you assume that um uh f so if

194
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,200
f here is differentiable

195
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,720
[Applause]

196
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:46,760
at x0. Then I claim that then f here is

197
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,760
also continuous

198
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,880
at x0. Okay. Okay. So, so in other

199
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,600
words, different being differentiable is

200
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,760
stronger than being continuous.

201
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
In a minute, we will see an example of

202
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,519
something that's continuous but not

203
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,839
differentiable.

204
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:15,000
And so

205
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,000
uh okay so now let's try to prove that

206
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,320
so right so I'm assuming that it's

207
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,839
differentiable so this means that

208
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,199
this

209
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,199
this difference quotient here

210
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,959
this here has a limit and that limit is

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:51,079
the derivative right as x go to x0.

212
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,079
So this means that um that there exist

213
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:02,160
uh there exist delta greater than zero

214
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,880
such that

215
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,760
if x here

216
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,279
uh minus x0

217
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,800
is less than delta

218
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,600
right of course I'm assuming that it's

219
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,519
not equal to x0.

220
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,720
If it is less than the difference to uh

221
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,000
between x and x0 is less than delta,

222
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:33,040
then this difference quotient here then

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,519
f of x - f

224
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,639
of x0

225
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:44,560
x - x0

226
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:47,839
- frime of x0. this thing here have to

227
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,440
be less than one right I mean this is

228
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,320
just using that this limit exists and

229
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,759
I'm sort of using in place of epsilon

230
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,759
I'm using one right

231
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,639
okay

232
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:11,440
[Applause]

233
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:14,959
now so this means just multiplying over

234
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,880
and And multiplying over you get that f

235
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,240
ofx

236
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,240
minus f of x0

237
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,759
uh minus

238
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,759
frime

239
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,800
uh of x0

240
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,160
this thing here

241
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,480
uh times I'm I'm multiplying both sides.

242
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,480
So I'm multiplying

243
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,000
both sides

244
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,440
uh by

245
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,759
uh x - x0. This is a positive thing,

246
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,040
right? So I'm multiplying both sync by

247
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,199
that. So then I get this thing here x -

248
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,920
x0.

249
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,360
Uh and then I get less less strictly

250
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,679
less than x - x0, right? Because this

251
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,480
here is strictly positive.

252
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,439
because x is not equal to x0. So I have

253
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:22,160
that and so I get that. So I now I just

254
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:25,160
split it up. So I have that f ofx - f of

255
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,160
x0

256
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,799
is now less than

257
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:38,520
x - x0

258
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,520
plus frime of x0.

259
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,520
time uh x - x0

260
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
right this is just the triangle

261
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,400
inequality that we've used many times

262
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,400
just on

263
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,679
right

264
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,280
and so now you see that um that if you

265
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,919
now

266
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,720
um so given

267
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,200
so now if you so now and this here of

268
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,679
course I can also write

269
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,880
uh like this

270
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:20,640
sorry I can just factor this out and I

271
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:24,720
can write it as 1 + frime of x0

272
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,679
like this fine and so now if I want this

273
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,640
thing here so so now you can if you were

274
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,440
to right so now you want to prove that f

275
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,880
is continuous at x0 so you want this

276
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,480
here to be less than some given epsilon

277
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,799
So given epsilon

278
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:48,720
epsilon greater than zero

279
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:53,280
you uh let

280
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:57,360
delta 1 be like the minimum

281
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,760
of uh if you let said

282
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,640
delta 1 to be the minimum of the delta

283
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,480
that I already chose. So then I have

284
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:10,720
this inequality

285
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:17,120
and then um and then uh epsilon

286
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:18,880
uh over 1 + frime of x0

287
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,120
right

288
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,960
so if I make delta

289
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,720
I choose delta like this then I have

290
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,039
this inequality

291
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:38,559
I fill in that so now I'm assuming that

292
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:40,480
this thing here is less than delta 1.

293
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,559
So again I have this inequality because

294
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:48,080
it's less than delta. So then uh when I

295
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:51,520
fill in here delta 1

296
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:56,320
for this then I see that this thing here

297
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,320
times this is less than epsilon.

298
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,320
This here

299
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
holds

300
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,799
when

301
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,919
x - x0

302
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,960
is less than delta 1 right again because

303
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,160
if it's less than delta 1 it's less than

304
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,160
delta so I have this inequality and then

305
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I can use that delta 1 since is less

306
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,280
than this

307
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,280
and then I get this inequality

308
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,000
okay so this prove right so this is

309
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,120
really what we want to prove right we

310
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
want to prove that if it's

311
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,679
differentiable then it's also continuous

312
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,559
and the continuity here I I proved it

313
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,760
you know with you know epsilon or delta

314
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,400
that you really should prove it like

315
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,799
okay

316
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,679
now let's look at some examples so this

317
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,600
means that if a function is

318
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,540
differentiable

319
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,049
then it's continuous

320
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,049
[Applause]

321
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Let me give you an example

322
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:12,880
uh of a function that is so let me give

323
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,760
you a few three examples.

324
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,600
The first example is maybe the simplest

325
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:23,200
one um that so this is the function f

326
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:27,760
ofx that is equal to the absolute value

327
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,760
of of x. So f here is defined on r into

328
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,760
r

329
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,240
and it's just the absolute value and so

330
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:44,440
I well the absolute value here so we've

331
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,440
seen before so f here is continuous

332
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,400
it's continuous at all points right uh

333
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,320
in particular of course at zero right

334
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,360
but if you now form the difference

335
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,799
quotient, right? Suppose that x here is

336
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,400
bigger than zero. And now look at the

337
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,840
difference quotient. So the difference

338
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,840
quotient uh

339
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,760
uh quotient

340
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,880
at uh at x0 equal to zero. If you're

341
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,520
looking at that difference quotient and

342
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,120
and you at the you first look at where x

343
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:32,880
is positive if x is positive then uh f

344
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:36,000
ofx minus f of 0 x - 0 this difference

345
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,559
quotient here if x is positive then this

346
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,960
thing here is just x. So this is x - 0

347
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:47,280
x - 0. So this here is one right this

348
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,000
difference quotient is one. This is when

349
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:55,520
x is positive. When x is negative

350
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,320
then the then f ofx

351
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,960
if x is negative then the absolute value

352
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,559
is minus x

353
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:11,360
right. So the difference quotient here f

354
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:15,280
ofx minus uh f of 0 which is zero x - 0.

355
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,159
This here is just - x

356
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,200
/ x.

357
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,559
But this thing here is minus one.

358
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,679
So for all if you are if you're looking

359
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,880
at the difference quotient

360
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,320
and you uh that comes from looking at

361
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:39,200
the derivative as zero. Then when you

362
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:41,440
approach zero from the right then the

363
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,400
difference quotient is one. When you

364
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,880
approach it from the sorry uh yeah from

365
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,799
the when you approach it from the left

366
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,600
then the difference quotient is minus

367
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,600
one. So it doesn't have a limit right.

368
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,080
It has a limit from the right from the

369
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,440
left but it doesn't have a limit if you

370
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,159
don't restrict where it's coming from.

371
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,840
So this function here

372
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,840
uh is not differentiable. Yeah.

373
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,520
>> So okay. So this is

374
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,600
right. So

375
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:28,480
so this so this is so so we did this

376
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:31,360
earlier in the class. So if you take

377
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:37,000
so

378
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,000
that the difference quotient here

379
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:49,200
that this thing here is converging to to

380
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:52,880
some number say a right. This here means

381
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,799
that for all for all epsilon greater

382
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,080
than zero there exist a delta greater

383
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:04,559
than zero such that

384
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,039
if x - x0

385
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,120
is less than delta

386
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,039
and again

387
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,640
x is is assumed to be different from x0.

388
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:20,120
If you have that then this difference

389
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,120
quotient here

390
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,360
minus this a

391
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,480
is supposed to be less than epsilon.

392
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,480
And so that's is

393
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,679
okay. And so you see again in this

394
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:48,080
example that we just looked at where uh

395
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:51,600
in the example that we just looked at

396
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:55,520
where uh so in the example

397
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,080
where f ofx was equal to the absolute

398
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,360
value of fx

399
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,240
the if you were graphing it then this

400
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,200
looks like this

401
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,600
right and we saw that the difference

402
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,919
quotion when you approach it over here,

403
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,000
difference quotient was one. When you

404
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,880
approach it over here, the difference

405
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,360
quotient is minus one. So if you take a

406
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:24,640
little any little interval around zero,

407
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,240
then there the difference quotient could

408
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,720
be either minus one or one, right? But

409
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,440
even however small you make this little

410
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,799
interval, it's not like that it converts

411
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,520
to some number because it has it it is

412
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,520
both you know they're both uh cases

413
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,320
where it's one and cases where it's

414
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,480
minus one.

415
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
Okay. So that's that's like the first

416
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,440
example

417
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,039
and again you know of a function that is

418
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,080
continuous

419
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:59,600
but it's it's not differentiable as at

420
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,159
zero. In this case it was a zero.

421
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Um and maybe a little bit more

422
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:10,200
interesting example along the same line

423
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,200
uh is uh the following.

424
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
So

425
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:36,240
So um if I so this is again a function

426
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:42,480
on r into r

427
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:45,840
and I said f ofx = x * sin of 1 /x. This

428
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,400
here is not really defined at zero. So I

429
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,960
need to define it also at zero. So when

430
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,039
x is equal to zero then I just set it

431
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,120
equal to

432
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:02,960
to to zero and otherwise I set it equal

433
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:05,039
to x * sin 1 /x okay

434
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,720
and so the thing is that this function

435
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,720
here so f here is continuous

436
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,440
in particular it's continuous at x at at

437
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,120
when at at zero it's continuous

438
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,880
continuous it's actually continuous

439
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,799
everywhere but but it's mostly

440
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,480
interested in it at zero the graph of

441
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:33,840
this to remember that sine function sine

442
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:35,919
function looks like this that at zero

443
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,840
um at zero

444
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,080
at pi

445
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,640
at 2 pi

446
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:48,720
at 3 pi and so on at all of these

447
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:53,120
by at all integer multiples also for the

448
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:57,200
negative ones at all integer multiple of

449
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:01,440
pi sign function vanishes

450
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:05,120
and in between here it is at pi / two it

451
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,720
achieves its maximum which is one and so

452
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,600
the function looks like this

453
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,600
so this here is one

454
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,279
right that's how a sign function looks

455
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,000
And so now if you're looking at sine of

456
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,320
1 /x that's going to be a function as

457
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,840
you're going down. So this is so if

458
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,960
you're looking at this here was sine of

459
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,520
x but if you're looking at sine of one

460
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,080
of x as x go to zero this here becomes

461
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,640
very large. So this means that as you're

462
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:46,080
going to zero it go very rapidly through

463
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,520
these periods where it goes where it's

464
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,480
oscillates between minus1 and one the

465
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
value here is minus one

466
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:02,159
and so as you it will look like this

467
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:05,200
that uh it will again uh if you're

468
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,760
looking at it will again fluctu it will

469
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,600
fluctuate but it will fluctuate operates

470
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:17,080
uh much more rapidly. So if this here

471
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,080
say was one over pi

472
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:25,200
at one over pi 1 over 1 / pi is the same

473
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,000
as pi there it would be zero and it

474
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,039
would like fluctuate

475
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,799
um it would fluctuate so it would look

476
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,799
like something like this but it would

477
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,799
fluctuate

478
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,559
you know

479
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,080
it and then as you're going way it will

480
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,559
fluctuate less less often right so as

481
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,279
you're going down towards zero it will

482
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:54,480
fluctuate a lot right it always because

483
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,880
sign always is between minus1 and one

484
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,240
the value here will always between

485
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,600
minus1 and one but as you're going

486
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,240
towards zero from the right or from the

487
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,720
left it's going to fluctuate more and

488
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,200
more right as you're going away from

489
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:16,640
zero is fluctuating less and less.

490
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,480
Okay. So, so this is the function I'm

491
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,480
interested in. And so, but when you

492
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,480
multiply

493
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,120
when you multiply through by X

494
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,760
then you see when you multiply through

495
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,960
by X it's fluctuating but it's always

496
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,679
fluctuating between minus1 and one. If

497
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,320
you

498
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,519
multiply it by x then as you're going to

499
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,120
zero this hair will squeeze down and it

500
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,399
will become the fluctuation will be zero

501
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,679
at zero. So it's easy to see that this

502
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,279
function here so is indeed continuous.

503
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,640
Right?

504
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,399
But let's look at the difference

505
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,399
quotient. So the difference quotient.

506
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,720
So if we're looking at the difference

507
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,360
quotion, so we're looking at and we just

508
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,720
look at the difference quotient at zero.

509
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,720
So this is the difference quotient

510
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:28,799
and so it's x sin 1 /x. The value at

511
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,799
zero by definition was zero.

512
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:40,159
And so you see that now this here the x

513
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,919
this here becomes just x sin 1 /x / x.

514
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,080
And so you see that this here cancel

515
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:49,519
with that. So you just get sine 1 /x.

516
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,720
And so you see that now as x go to so

517
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,320
when x here goes to zero

518
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,320
this here fluctuates. This have

519
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,320
fluctuate

520
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,679
between

521
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,600
minus one and one n1

522
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,600
but it doesn't have a limit right

523
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,279
because it's fluctuated y or why not

524
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,519
right. So this is a this is an example

525
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,120
again this is another example of a

526
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,279
function that is continuous

527
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,880
at zero but not differentiable at zero.

528
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,480
It's actually much worse than the

529
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,640
previous the previous one was the

530
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,440
previous one the example the

531
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,159
previous example that was this example

532
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,799
is much more tame. It is not

533
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,840
differentiable at zero but if you were

534
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,240
restrict to just positive things then

535
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,360
from then it would be differentiable

536
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,159
right if you were you could also define

537
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,120
derivative. In general when we define

538
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,120
derivative we let it be defined in a

539
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,840
neighborhood of that point. So on either

540
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,320
side. But if you were considering where

541
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,440
you were allowing the function just to

542
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,879
be defined at this point and then to the

543
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,800
right say or to the left then this

544
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,240
function would be differentiable. Right?

545
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,040
But the in the in in in this example

546
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,359
here it doesn't matter if you restrict

547
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,280
the interval to just to the right or to

548
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,760
the left. It's still not differential.

549
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,159
Okay.

550
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Right. So this is something about this

551
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,720
example is something about that it

552
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,760
fluctuates wildly

553
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,200
and that is causing it not to be

554
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,200
differentiable. If it wasn't again if if

555
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:44,720
you if you defined it if you didn't have

556
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,200
this kind of the X here is sort of

557
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,079
serving as some sort of it's dampening

558
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,760
how much it's fluctuating right so if

559
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,320
there wasn't a X here then this function

560
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,119
wouldn't it would just fluctuate

561
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,920
and it wouldn't even be continuous at X0

562
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,960
right but once I put this X on then it

563
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,760
becomes continuous if I put another x.

564
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:15,760
So if I'm looking at

565
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,599
f ofx = x^2 * sin

566
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,480
1 / x. Suppose I'm looking at this

567
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,440
function. So now I have sort of dampened

568
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,760
dampened the fluctuation even more. And

569
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,119
so if I again looking at the difference

570
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,440
quotient. So so I'm looking at this

571
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,079
function maybe I should be more careful.

572
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,800
So again at zero I need to define it

573
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:46,240
separately. So I define a function

574
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:52,359
that is zero at x = 0 and then it is x^2

575
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,359
* sin 1 /x otherwise

576
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,560
if I'm looking at this function then I

577
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,880
claim that this function is in fact uh

578
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:07,119
French at x at zero and so let's look at

579
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,119
Okay.

580
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,520
So again, I'm looking at the difference

581
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,720
quotient

582
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,720
and the value at zero is zero. So I have

583
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
this.

584
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:27,040
And so this here is now just x²

585
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:30,079
sin 1 /x. This thing here is then x. And

586
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,440
so you see that this difference quotient

587
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:38,240
is just this. But this here does

588
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,160
converge to zero as x go to zero.

589
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,880
Right? So this function is actually

590
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,839
differentiable. Right? It's fluctuates

591
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,160
but it's it's more mild the way it

592
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:53,520
fluctuates.

593
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:58,320
Okay. Now let me get back to the the

594
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:02,119
rules. So we proved one uh rule that was

595
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,119
this sum rule.

596
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,760
Then the second rule we're interested in

597
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,520
is when we're looking at the likeness

598
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,280
rule. So we're looking at the product of

599
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,079
these two functions and each function is

600
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,839
assumed to be differentiable

601
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,880
uh at x0 and then we claim that the

602
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,160
product function is also differentiable

603
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,880
at x0 and this is the formula for the

604
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,640
derivative. Right?

605
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,520
to prove this one here I need this fact

606
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,079
that we have now proved that if it is

607
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,280
defensible then it's also continuous at

608
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,880
that point okay so I'm going to use that

609
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,440
fact

610
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,760
and so

611
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,760
and now

612
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,400
so so now so

613
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,720
let's

614
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,720
let's prove

615
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,520
uh of lightness room.

616
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,160
So we have uh these two functions. We're

617
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,480
looking at f of x. We form the

618
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,480
difference quotient.

619
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,200
So this is the difference quotient x -

620
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
x0

621
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,359
uh I I we do this trick that we've done

622
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,040
a bunch of times before when we also

623
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:41,599
looked at products. We had two sequences

624
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,240
and we looked at the sequence that was

625
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,079
the product of the these two. Right? So

626
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:52,200
if you have just a reminder

627
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,200
that I mean it's not like

628
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,400
but but but

629
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,680
so remember that if you had a sequence a

630
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:11,440
n and a sequence bn and you knew that a

631
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:17,599
n converts to a and bn converts to b

632
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:21,440
then the product here converts to a * b.

633
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:25,920
Right? So, and when we prove that we use

634
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,960
this little trick with that we are uh

635
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,520
we're splitting the difference between

636
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,040
this and this. Right? And so I'm going

637
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,280
to do exactly the same trick here.

638
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,520
So I'm looking at this thing here. And

639
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,040
so I write this thing here as f ofx * g

640
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,800
ofx

641
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,560
minus and it doesn't really matter

642
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,960
you know where you're inserting it. So

643
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,640
this here it's like splitting the

644
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,640
difference and then I have to add it

645
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,640
again.

646
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:10,320
So this is certainly the same. I'm just

647
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:13,839
subtracting it and adding it right back.

648
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:17,839
And now I split this into two. So I

649
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:21,280
write this in here. So I So this uh

650
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,400
fraction I split into two. And the first

651
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,280
one I take this one here together. So

652
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:33,839
and you can factor out f ofx. You can

653
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:38,720
write it like this. f of x - f of x0

654
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:42,320
x - x0 right so this is just right I'm

655
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,560
just here I'm factoring out the g of x

656
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,960
and then I'm left with this this is this

657
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,720
and this is giving the denominator like

658
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,359
that this is this part here and then I

659
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,920
have the other part here but there you

660
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,920
see that f of x0 is factoring out

661
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:07,440
and then I have g of x minus g of x0 x -

662
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,400
x0

663
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,880
like that.

664
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:20,160
But now you see that as x goes to x0,

665
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:23,440
right? Well, g was continuous at x0,

666
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,839
right? So this thing here

667
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,960
as x go to x0 this thing here goes to g

668
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,359
of x0 right this one here that was

669
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,160
because g was continuous because it was

670
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:40,520
differentiable so it was also continuous

671
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,520
this here goes to the derivative

672
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,920
and the second thing here is this here

673
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,680
is just constant

674
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,680
and this here goes to the derivative

675
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,400
like that

676
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,200
right so we have so what we have proven

677
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,359
is this here is as x goes to x0

678
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,119
so you see that we have proven that the

679
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,760
difference this difference quotient here

680
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,880
for the product

681
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,280
has a limit and this is what the limit

682
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,520
is right and so this means that the

683
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,000
product is differentiable

684
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,119
and this here is the derivative and

685
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,160
that's exactly the this formula. Okay,

686
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,160
which was this over here. This formula

687
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,160
here.

688
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:35,359
Okay, the next thing is that we uh want

689
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,760
to prove the next rule is like this

690
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:42,839
quotient rule.

691
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,839
So let me prove the quotient rule.

692
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,039
[Applause]

693
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,440
So, Leness, right? Less and

694
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:12,680
Leness and Newton was the one that was

695
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,680
uh um um responsible for calculus.

696
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:20,200
Uh and so then the next thing I want to

697
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,200
prove is this quotion.

698
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,200
And so again you have these two

699
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,200
functions f and g

700
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,079
and uh they are differentiable.

701
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:55,760
at x0 and I'm also assuming that g here

702
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:59,040
at x0

703
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,960
is is not equal to let's just assume

704
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:07,680
that g is not equal to zero everywhere

705
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:10,000
is never is is is is different from zero

706
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,000
everywhere.

707
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,520
And then the quotient rule say that if

708
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:26,160
you're looking at the quotient here and

709
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,839
you take the derivative of the so it say

710
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,280
that if you're looking at the quotient

711
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,760
here maybe I should so the quotion will

712
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,520
say that that if you're looking at this

713
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,760
thing here this now makes sense because

714
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,640
g does not vanish

715
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,640
This here is differentiable

716
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,640
at x0. And the derivative

717
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,640
the derivative of this function

718
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,240
at x0

719
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:06,000
is given by the following formula that

720
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:08,079
it is the derivative of f at x0 time g

721
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:16,880
of x0

722
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:23,359
minus uh um f at x0 * g prime at x0

723
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:28,599
divided by G G² so G of X0 times itself

724
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,599
I'll write that as a square this

725
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:38,520
here again this here this here is just g

726
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,520
of X0 * G of X0

727
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,160
okay

728
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,160
so now let's try to prove

729
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:17,680
So we're looking at f ofx f like this at

730
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,760
x minus. So this is the difference

731
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:25,119
quotient

732
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:28,560
at x0 divided by x - x0, right? That's

733
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:32,720
the difference quotion. And so written

734
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,880
out this is f of x

735
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,640
g of x

736
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,560
minus

737
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:44,240
g uh f sorry f of x0

738
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:49,920
divided by g of x0

739
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:52,480
x - x0. So let me put this on a with on

740
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,319
a fraction with a common denominator. So

741
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,599
if I do that then this thing here is

742
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:04,079
right. So then I'm multiplying

743
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:07,040
uh by g of x0 both in the denominator

744
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,720
and denominator here. So I'm getting f

745
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,560
of x

746
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,359
times g of x0

747
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,160
and then here I'm multiplying by g of x

748
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:21,119
in both denominator and denominator. So

749
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:27,839
getting this thing here

750
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:33,200
g of x and then it becomes x - x0

751
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:36,440
and then g of x g of x0

752
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,440
like that.

753
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:45,280
And so now you can write this thing here

754
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,680
uh as right. And so now you do the same

755
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,920
trick uh as before.

756
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:57,520
I mean I could have I could have gotten

757
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:59,839
away uh slightly easier with looking at

758
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,400
a special case of this quotion rule

759
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:05,520
where f was a constant function one. So

760
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,480
I could do that first and then the

761
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,560
general case I could then from get from

762
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,560
this special case together with the

763
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,640
lens. But I chose to it's most often

764
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,800
they want to do it together anyway. But

765
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,319
if you have to do it together, you have

766
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,880
to use the same trick that we just did.

767
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,880
So we're using

768
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,079
uh that over here.

769
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,880
So uh

770
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,680
so f ofx

771
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:45,440
g of x0

772
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:48,839
minus uh and then uh f of uh f of x0

773
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,839
g of x0

774
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:57,440
plus uh f of x0

775
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,359
g of x0

776
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,760
uh minus f(x)

777
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,760
g of x. So this is again where I'm

778
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,920
subtracting in the denominator something

779
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,520
and then I'm adding it back up

780
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,079
immediately.

781
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,079
So I have this

782
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,880
like that.

783
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,319
And so now uh if you do that then you

784
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:33,200
see that. So now you can and now you

785
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:35,839
split it up again into two fractions.

786
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:40,079
So we split it up

787
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:42,319
and so this thing here this thing here

788
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,839
but there you see that there's a g of x0

789
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:51,359
that factor out. So this is equal to g

790
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:53,280
of x0 and then you have f ofx minus f of

791
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,359
x0

792
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,520
and then x - x0

793
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:04,000
g of x

794
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:07,440
g of x0 like that.

795
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,760
And for the second one, see that there

796
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,880
you there you also have something that's

797
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:17,680
factor out. And this is f of x0

798
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:23,040
like that.

799
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:26,559
And you're getting g of u of x0

800
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:28,160
minus g of x

801
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,400
over

802
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,880
um x - x0.

803
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:39,680
uh g of x

804
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:44,800
g of x here like that.

805
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:48,880
And now okay so now I can make this

806
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,720
looks nicer. I can this one here cancel

807
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,760
with that.

808
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,480
And so I can write this thing here as 1

809
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,319
/ g of x

810
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,280
f ofx

811
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:05,920
- f of x0

812
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:12,559
/ x - x0. So this take care of this.

813
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:16,160
Here I can um here I can um I will write

814
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:20,480
it as I will take this one here out. So

815
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:23,200
I'll write it as f of x0

816
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,480
g of x

817
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,280
time g of x0.

818
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,119
And then I'm left with this thing here.

819
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,599
And what I don't love about this thing

820
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,920
here is it's not quite the difference

821
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:40,240
quotient because the order of these two

822
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:44,640
is wrong. So I switch the order. But if

823
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:47,200
I switch the order then I have to

824
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,200
pick up a minus sign. So I get minus

825
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:54,079
here. And now it is g of x

826
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:58,079
g of x0

827
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:02,720
x - x0 like that.

828
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:05,280
Okay. And now you see that as x so as x

829
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,079
goes to x0

830
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,480
so now as x

831
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,800
goes to x0

832
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,640
well this one here the function was

833
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,960
differentiable so it's also continuous.

834
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,720
So this goes to 1 / g of x0.

835
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,280
This one here just goes to the

836
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,920
derivative

837
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,640
at x0.

838
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,800
This one here goes to again because the

839
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,839
function is continuous. This goes to

840
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,640
minus f of x0

841
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:41,240
and then it's what I wrote before as d²

842
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,240
is d of x0 * itself.

843
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,920
And then this in here goes to the

844
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:51,920
derivative of x0 at zero.

845
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:54,160
Right? And now I can if I want to I can

846
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,119
rewrite this in here. If I want to put

847
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,000
it back on a common denominator, then I

848
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,599
have to multiply in the nominator and

849
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,400
denominator by g of x0. If I do this, I

850
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:14,640
get f prime of x0 g of x0

851
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,880
and then I get g^2 of x0 in the

852
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:22,319
denominator. And then here it's just

853
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:25,280
those two minus f of x0

854
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:28,640
g prime of x0.

855
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,520
And so you see that this here is exactly

856
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,680
this formula here this this quotion rule

857
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:38,800
right. So this proof that if you take

858
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,280
two functions the the one you have in

859
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,480
the denominator if that is non vanishing

860
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,359
so you can form the quotient and if each

861
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:50,240
of these two functions is differentiable

862
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,520
then the quotient is also differentiable

863
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,280
and this is the formula for the

864
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,680
derivative

865
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,599
right so now why is this already really

866
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,599
really useful

867
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,599
so

868
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:08,240
so We calculated

869
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:12,640
we already we calculated so we started

870
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:16,400
with the example of where f is a

871
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,079
constant right and we saw that it's

872
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,520
differentiable and the derivative is

873
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:25,599
zero. Then the second example we had was

874
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:27,920
where the function was x and we saw that

875
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:32,400
it was differentiable and the derivative

876
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,800
is one. Right? If you now take um if you

877
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,920
now take ax

878
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,160
times uh right so let's just take ax as

879
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:44,160
the next example

880
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:47,599
this is like a constant function times

881
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:51,040
this function so light rule sorry if f

882
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,760
ofx is equal to a * x where a is a

883
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,440
constant lightn will say that the

884
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,200
product of two differentiable functions

885
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,000
is differentiable and the derivative of

886
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,359
This is the derivative of that, but the

887
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,720
derivative of that does a constant

888
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,119
function. So that's zero. So I don't

889
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,000
really have to think about that. So it's

890
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,760
just the a times the derivative of the

891
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,280
second function, but that's one. So this

892
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:18,000
here is the derivative of that.

893
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:23,119
Right? So and the next example would be

894
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:26,079
that you're looking at a x plus say b f

895
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,839
of x is equal to this. Then you can use

896
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,480
the sum

897
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:33,040
plus you know we know what each of these

898
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,280
is. So you get that this one here is

899
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:39,119
also differentiable and the derivative

900
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,839
of this function here is also just a and

901
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,520
and you can continue like this that if

902
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:47,440
you take

903
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:51,280
um if you use if you now have a polomial

904
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:56,240
suppose you take a to the power n so f

905
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:58,559
of sorry uh if f of x is x to the^ n

906
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:03,520
then you can think about this thing here

907
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:06,799
as x * X * X * X

908
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,119
and you can use the lieness rule right

909
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:12,960
and so if you use the leness rule so you

910
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,200
just do it first in the case where f ofx

911
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,079
is equal to x^2 you can think about this

912
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,280
as x * x these are two differentiable

913
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:24,799
functions so the derivative here is now

914
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:28,079
the derivative of this so that's 1 times

915
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:30,000
the other function plus you keep this

916
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:34,240
one here and you take the derivative of

917
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,119
that. So this is this. So this is 2 * x,

918
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:40,640
right? And so if you take this function

919
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,040
here using lightness rule,

920
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:46,079
in this case the derivative it's

921
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:53,839
differentiable and the derivative

922
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:56,559
is uh n * x ^ nus one. Right?

923
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,480
So that's so so and and in fact find

924
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,720
even more generally

925
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,440
you know just using the sum and the

926
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:11,760
likeness rule if you take any

927
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:15,200
if you take any polomium a n x n + a n

928
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,079
-1 x n minus one

929
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,000
down to

930
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,400
the last sign is being a constant. If

931
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,839
you take a polinomial like this just

932
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:29,440
using the lieness rule and the sum rule

933
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:32,400
using those repeatedly

934
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,799
we know that this here is differentiable

935
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,119
and the derivative is just like the sum

936
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:43,200
of the derivative of these. So this is

937
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:51,599
going to be a n * n * x ^ n -1

938
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:53,359
+ n -1 * a n -1 x n - 2

939
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,520
and then the this one here the

940
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:58,640
derivative is zero. So the last one

941
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:01,520
you're getting something non-trivial for

942
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,760
is a one

943
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,680
right. So this is just using sum and

944
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:10,040
license room.

945
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,040
And so this is just using

946
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:18,359
the sum

947
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,359
plus lightness room

948
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,440
repeatedly.

949
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,880
Okay. Now likewise if you take a

950
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,280
rational function so meaning that if you

951
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:43,119
take something if f ofx

952
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,680
is equal to some polomium

953
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:48,799
a polomial

954
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:54,319
so it's called p

955
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:57,960
of x divided by uh q of x. So where this

956
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,960
here is a polinomial

957
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:10,839
and and and so is that right? So now you

958
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,839
can use the uh the quotient rule right.

959
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,240
So the quotient rule will tell you that

960
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:23,359
as long as you are looking at point

961
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:26,559
where this here does not vanish. So then

962
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:28,640
the quotient here is also differentiable

963
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,799
and it gives you a formula for the

964
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,440
derivative in terms of the derivative of

965
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:37,599
each of these two and each of those two

966
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,839
they can be calculated like that.

967
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,880
So you see it's already already now we

968
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:44,799
have like quite the derivative of a lot

969
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,960
of functions right we have of all

970
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:51,040
function and of all rational functions

971
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:54,599
rational functions again are clos

972
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,599
by other polinomial

973
00:59:54,799 --> 01:00:00,160
okay

974
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:05,200
so now the next rule uh that we want to

975
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,200
talk about is the the chain rule

976
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,680
So what is the chain rule?

977
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:16,640
So the chain rule is a little bit

978
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:19,440
different from those three rules here

979
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:22,400
and and it is where you take the

980
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:26,920
composition of functions.

981
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,920
So the next is the chain rule

982
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:36,359
and again this is about

983
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:36,359
composition

984
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,000
of functions.

985
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:52,040
Okay. So I have a function f that goes

986
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,040
say from

987
01:00:52,079 --> 01:01:01,119
say that it goes from some interval a to

988
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:04,400
b into another interval from c to d

989
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:08,400
and then I have a function g

990
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:11,440
that goes from this interval here

991
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:15,680
into r

992
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:21,040
because g is defined you So like

993
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:24,880
whatever the the image of of of F always

994
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:28,960
if it's in this set this is where G is

995
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,720
defined then you have that uh you can

996
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,640
form

997
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:39,680
if you take some X in here. So if X here

998
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:43,599
is in A to B then this here makes sense

999
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:46,000
and this is now an element here. So this

1000
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,359
is where G is defined. So this here

1001
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,079
makes sense, right? And this is now what

1002
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:55,599
we call the composition. And we write it

1003
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:58,400
like this. It's important to write it in

1004
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:02,640
the correct order.

1005
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:07,599
And so this is the composition function.

1006
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:10,079
Okay. And uh and the thing is that this

1007
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:13,079
so right. So now the chain rule is the

1008
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,079
following.

1009
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,440
So the chain rule is a following

1010
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,440
theorem.

1011
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,880
that if

1012
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,880
f is differentiable

1013
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,160
at x0

1014
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,440
and

1015
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:02,319
and uh g

1016
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,319
is differentiable.

1017
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:15,599
at y0 where y0 is equal to the value of

1018
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:18,480
f at x0.

1019
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:21,200
Then the composition then the

1020
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,799
composition of these two functions is

1021
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,359
differentiable

1022
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:31,440
at x0. And the derivative is equal to

1023
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:35,760
the derivative of g at y0 times the

1024
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:37,839
derivative of f at x0. So this is the

1025
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,760
chain rule, right? The chain rule say

1026
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:41,440
that the composition is also

1027
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,559
differentiable

1028
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,440
at x0. And this is the formula for the

1029
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,799
derivative.

1030
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,359
Okay, let's try to prove that. Uh and so

1031
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:59,280
that we in this case it's useful to

1032
01:03:53,359 --> 01:04:02,280
divide up to two to two cases.

1033
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,280
Um

1034
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:10,720
and the two cases to divide up to. So

1035
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:14,240
let me just look at the look at the

1036
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,240
special case first and then once we

1037
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,200
understand that it's would be clear the

1038
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,880
general case would be clear. So let's

1039
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,119
make one assumption. So let's try to

1040
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,119
prove it.

1041
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:30,200
Uh and but we assume first

1042
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:36,920
that the derivative

1043
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:44,319
I'm going to assume that the derivative

1044
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:47,039
at x0 is not equal to zero. So I'm

1045
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:50,319
assuming that first. What does this

1046
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:53,599
guarantee me? Well, remember that the

1047
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:57,000
derivative is the limit of this

1048
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,000
difference quotient,

1049
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:05,839
right? So this is this is the limit.

1050
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:08,880
If this here is not equal to zero,

1051
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:12,240
this means that when x is very close to

1052
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,000
x0, this thing here

1053
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,319
is

1054
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,680
very close to this thing that is not

1055
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:24,240
equal to zero. But then it means that if

1056
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:28,079
you are very close to x0, f ofx cannot

1057
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:32,000
be equal to. So if you have this here,

1058
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:35,599
this implies that f ofx

1059
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:40,240
is not equal to x0

1060
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,920
for sorry is not equal to f of x0

1061
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:46,280
for

1062
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,280
x sufficiently closed

1063
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,440
close to x0.

1064
01:05:52,480 --> 01:06:00,160
I'm always assuming of course that x is

1065
01:05:54,799 --> 01:06:03,839
not But x is not equal to right.

1066
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,920
So, so I'm going to first make this

1067
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:08,559
assumption. And if I make this

1068
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,200
assumption, what I get out of it is that

1069
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,760
this thing here is not equal to that.

1070
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:17,440
Why is this useful? Because now I can

1071
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:21,119
actually look at this difference and I

1072
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:25,160
can divide by it. Okay.

1073
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,160
So, I'm going to

1074
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,520
I'm going to just to make things a

1075
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,799
little bit clearer.

1076
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,799
So I have my function.

1077
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:45,200
So this here is is this f and here I

1078
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,760
have g.

1079
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:51,200
Here I have x0.

1080
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:55,599
But under f it's taken to this which is

1081
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:59,200
f of x0. But this I also will denote by

1082
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:04,160
y z right. So I'm denoting just to make

1083
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:09,280
clear y0 is just the value here.

1084
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:11,119
And then I will use uh for I will I will

1085
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:15,119
f ofx

1086
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:16,799
I will denote by y. Okay.

1087
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:20,400
So now I'm looking at the difference

1088
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:28,559
quotient. So I'm looking at f of sorry

1089
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:31,960
I'm looking at g of f of x minus uh g of

1090
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,960
f of x0

1091
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:38,000
uh x - x0 that's what I'm supposed to

1092
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,440
look at

1093
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:46,960
and I'm can write this thing here

1094
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:50,079
as g of y because this here I also call

1095
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:53,520
y right so you can write it like this g

1096
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:59,200
of y 0

1097
01:07:53,520 --> 01:08:01,520
and then I will write it as y - y 0 but

1098
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:06,079
I didn't have this in the denominator up

1099
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:09,280
here so I have to multiply it back on

1100
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:11,920
and then I still have to divide by like

1101
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:15,520
like that right so I can write it like

1102
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,199
this this here I'm happy with we'll get

1103
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,759
to this in just a taken, but I'm happy

1104
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:22,319
with this expression. The other one I

1105
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:27,719
really want to put it back in in terms

1106
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,719
of f. So I'm writing this thing here.

1107
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,640
And this thing here, I really want to

1108
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:43,839
put it back in in terms of f. So if I do

1109
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:47,480
that, I write it as f ofx - f of x0

1110
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,480
x - x0.

1111
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:56,560
But now you see that as um as x go to

1112
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,239
x0, right?

1113
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:04,159
Well, as x go to x0 the because the

1114
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:08,239
function f was continuous at x0 it means

1115
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:11,199
that if x go to x0 then the value at x

1116
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:14,560
which is y will go to the value at x0.

1117
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:17,120
So when when

1118
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:23,239
x goes to x0

1119
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:23,239
we have that y goes to y0

1120
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,960
right

1121
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:31,920
so this means that this thing here this

1122
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,640
here converge right that's just because

1123
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:38,000
the function f is differentiable so this

1124
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,880
here will converge to the derivative so

1125
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:45,520
this the the second factor here is

1126
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:47,679
converging to fprime at x0. The first

1127
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:52,000
factor is but now you see that we just

1128
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:53,679
argued that y goes to y0. So this is

1129
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,080
also a difference quotient, but it's a

1130
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,719
difference quotient for g. And since y

1131
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:04,239
goes to y z, this difference quotient

1132
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:06,640
here goes to the derivative of g at at y

1133
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:09,520
z.

1134
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,920
Right? But that's exactly the formula

1135
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:15,840
that we wanted to prove except that we

1136
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:18,640
made one assumption that the derivative

1137
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:22,000
of f

1138
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,840
at x0 was not equal to zero. We made

1139
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,719
that assumption only so that this number

1140
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:32,239
here was not equal to zero. Right? And

1141
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:35,360
so we could kind of divide by it.

1142
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:38,159
Right? But actually otherwise

1143
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:42,800
um

1144
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:46,320
right if if you for some reason if y was

1145
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:49,920
not equal to y z

1146
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:52,560
but right then this formula here would

1147
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,800
still hold right so it's only the the

1148
01:10:52,560 --> 01:11:00,640
the possibility

1149
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:02,640
that uh that y could be equal to y z but

1150
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:06,320
now you see that if you We're just

1151
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,080
looking at the difference quotient g of

1152
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,159
f

1153
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:14,159
g of uh of y

1154
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:18,159
minus

1155
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:19,920
sorry uh g of f ofx

1156
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:22,640
minus.

1157
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:27,600
So this is the difference quotion that

1158
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:30,320
is the one we really have to look at for

1159
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,840
the

1160
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:36,320
for the composition right and this is

1161
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,560
what we also called this here is what we

1162
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:44,440
call this thing here is what we called

1163
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,440
y0 this thing here is what we call y

1164
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:53,679
and the only case we haven't dealt with

1165
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:59,120
is where f prime

1166
01:11:53,679 --> 01:12:00,800
of zero is equal to zero and

1167
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,719
y

1168
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,159
is equal to y z right this here again

1169
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:12,560
was f of x and this here was equal to f

1170
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:15,440
of x0 so this only this case here we

1171
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:19,120
haven't dealt with right

1172
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:23,280
but you see that if If you if it h if it

1173
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:25,760
so happened that f ofx was equal to f of

1174
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,600
z then this difference quotient here the

1175
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,840
d the denominator would trivially be

1176
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:34,159
zero right and so you want to prove we

1177
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,239
have that if this here was not equal to

1178
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:40,640
zero then we have that this is

1179
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:42,960
converging to the to the derivative

1180
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,960
and the only case we have to look at

1181
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:48,480
where this derivative is zero. So we

1182
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,880
want we are claiming that so the only

1183
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:55,600
case we're left with that we haven't

1184
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:57,840
dealt with is first of all where the

1185
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:01,800
derivative

1186
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,800
so let's see so

1187
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:07,719
let me just write down here clearly the

1188
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,719
remaining case

1189
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,719
remaining case

1190
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,159
for the chain rule

1191
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:29,400
So the main cases that the derivative at

1192
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,400
x0 is zero. Right?

1193
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,640
And and we have already observed that if

1194
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:38,960
the derivative is zero but

1195
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:43,280
but

1196
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:49,840
y is not equal to y z. If this is the

1197
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:52,400
case then actually g of f ofx

1198
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:55,679
minus g

1199
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:58,640
of f of x0.

1200
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:02,000
This thing here

1201
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:04,960
still converge in this case here where

1202
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,480
this is the case. This here still

1203
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:11,360
converts to zero. Right? So, so we still

1204
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:14,000
have the chain rule

1205
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,159
in that case if this here was not the

1206
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,400
case. The only thing we have to worry

1207
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:23,679
about is what if y was equal to y z. But

1208
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:26,320
if y was equal to y z when we're looking

1209
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,719
at the difference quotient, this is the

1210
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:32,080
difference quotion after all. And so in

1211
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:35,520
that case, this thing here is y z. This

1212
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:38,560
is y z. But in that case the difference

1213
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:41,760
quotion is actually zero already. So of

1214
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,239
course it's it's going to be very close

1215
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,560
to zero right it's actually is zero

1216
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:49,199
right you see that the remaining case

1217
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,080
that's sort of trivial

1218
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:54,239
but we wanted to first exclude it

1219
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,480
because we wanted to be able to divide

1220
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:59,920
by this difference right and then once

1221
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,920
we have seen that under that assumption

1222
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:05,360
it was it was you know we got the

1223
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:09,600
formula we wanted then we go back and

1224
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:12,880
then we say that not only you know the

1225
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,040
the the the the remaining issue was well

1226
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,040
first of all

1227
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:21,840
was the case where the derivative was

1228
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:24,719
zero but in fact um you the only case

1229
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:28,239
that was potentially a problem was when

1230
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:30,400
y was equal to y zero but for that it's

1231
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:33,840
the difference quotient was was actually

1232
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:36,400
trivial zero okay so that's the the

1233
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,400
chain rule

1234
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,640
Um, and so we only have a few minutes

1235
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:46,080
left. Uh, and I won't quite be able to

1236
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:49,360
get through all of the stuff. Uh, but I

1237
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:53,040
can get through one more lema.

1238
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:57,159
And so, and then I'll pick up from from

1239
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:57,159
here uh, next time.

1240
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:04,000
uh the notes are already posted but but

1241
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:06,560
so the last bit of the notes we'll do

1242
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:11,040
next time.

1243
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:15,040
So so the following lema here.

1244
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:18,320
So if you have a function

1245
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:25,640
say from R to R

1246
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:25,640
and you have that X here X0 is a local

1247
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,080
max

1248
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:36,159
or min.

1249
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:39,800
So f is a function from r to r that is

1250
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:39,800
that is differentiable.

1251
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:52,440
And uh x0 is a local max or local min

1252
01:16:54,239 --> 01:17:00,000
for f.

1253
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,800
then uh then

1254
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,880
the derivative

1255
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,239
at x0

1256
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:10,320
is equal to zero. Okay,

1257
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:16,000
let me remind you what a local max and

1258
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:20,320
local min is. So if you take a function

1259
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,800
so a local max similar for a local min

1260
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:26,640
if you have a function here you have

1261
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:31,360
here x0 a local max means that in a

1262
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:38,840
neighborhood of x this point then the

1263
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:38,840
value at x0 is the maximum. So local max

1264
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:46,719
at x0

1265
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:50,199
means

1266
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,199
that they exist

1267
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,920
delta greater than zero such that

1268
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:06,320
um that if you're looking at the

1269
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:11,840
interval

1270
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:16,480
um to either side of x0 this interval

1271
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:20,719
and you're looking at uh at f here

1272
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:24,719
restricted to this subset then uh then

1273
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:28,800
uh x0 is a local max is a max. So this

1274
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:31,440
means that f ofx zero is equal to the

1275
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:36,239
max

1276
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:39,640
of f where x here is in this little

1277
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:39,640
interval here.

1278
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:49,760
Oops. Like that.

1279
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,719
Right. So it's it may not be right. So,

1280
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:55,679
so the idea is that it's just the

1281
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:59,199
function may look like this and this

1282
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:01,920
here is x0. So, you see that in a

1283
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:05,199
neighborhood like this, it looks like

1284
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:07,120
that you have that this x0 is a maximum,

1285
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:10,159
but there might even be somewhere else

1286
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:13,440
where the value is much higher. Right?

1287
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:15,840
So, that's a local maximum and similarly

1288
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:18,159
for a local minimum. Okay? And so I

1289
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:22,239
won't be able to to actually prove this

1290
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:24,560
lema. We we'll prove that next time. Uh

1291
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:27,120
and then once we have that lema, we

1292
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,199
prove what's called roles theorem. And

1293
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:32,080
then we will use it to prove the mean

1294
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:33,679
battle theorem. But so but I'll do that

1295
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:38,600
next time, but it's actually in the

1296
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:38,600
notes that I I posted already.
