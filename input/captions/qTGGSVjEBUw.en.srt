1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,640
good afternoon

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,480
so with been studying properties of

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,359
stable equilibrium

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,680
States relations that can be extracted

5
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,080
from the fundamental

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,960
relation of any

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,520
system and therefore if the system is

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,120
for example a substance of a pure

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:41,360
substance or mixtures of

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,239
substances um yes it is a lot of um

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,280
math and mathematical manipulations and

12
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,079
today we'll have a little more of that

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,359
uh then we we we stop about the

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,519
mathematics at least for this part uh

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,960
but I wanted

16
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:05,080
to to stress the fact that

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:09,759
we are extracting a lot of U information

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,000
out of just the idea that there exists a

19
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,759
fundamental relation for stable

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
equilibrium States from which we can

21
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,560
extract

22
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:24,079
properties uh and it's precisely the

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,920
mathematical M manipulations that is not

24
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:31,000
just by itself but with proper physical

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,640
interpretation and that's the important

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,079
aspect it's not just the mathematics

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,720
it's also to interpret the mathematics

28
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,960
and then see what the useful part of it

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,399
is it's from this that you can extract a

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,680
lot of

31
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,680
information uh for example in

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,880
um in

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,880
economics manipulations of this

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,920
sort have earned uh the Nobel Prize to

35
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:04,000
Paul Samuelson who was a professor here

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,560
with MIT uh because you realize that

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
essentially also in economics don't ask

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,599
me what part of Economics but in any

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,040
case in economics there are functions

40
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,120
like that that can be manipulated by the

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,360
tools that we are developing from which

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,080
you can extract a lot of information

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:27,640
about uh economics in that

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,680
case so uh mathematics is a powerful uh

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,519
uh

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:37,200
tool and way of that allows you to think

47
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,120
straight so all right yes we've done the

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,560
Leandra transform and uh we have applied

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,400
it to derive uh uh the elal free energy

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,519
the Gibs free energy the

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,879
enthalpy and also this Oiler free

52
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:55,480
energy that uh

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,920
will return to to to also today and uh

54
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,360
and the next

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,400
time also we develop this Max

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,120
coming from the second this the the

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,120
reciprocity of the second order

58
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,440
derivatives of the various

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,560
functions today I want to introduce uh

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,280
quickly or in the review quickly if

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,000
you've seen it already the this um other

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,000
tool which is the Jacobian

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,360
determinants uh so if you have a system

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,319
of two uh

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,000
functions and you take the Matrix in

66
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,799
which you put all the the partial

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,400
derivatives in that fashion the

68
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,720
determinant of that Matrix is called the

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,560
Jacobian determinant The Matrix is the

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,200
Jacobian and the determinant of the of

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,400
the Jacobian is we call it

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,720
the uh Jacobian anyway just for short

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,519
and we use this uh symbol which

74
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,159
resembles a partial because somehow it's

75
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,680
it's a partial of a vector of of

76
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,640
functions with respect to a vector of

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,959
the uh independent

78
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,239
variables and it has these properties

79
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,640
which you can infer easily by uh the

80
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,799
properties of determinants you exchange

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,639
a row exchange a column you exchange the

82
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,639
sign uh and uh so you can easily prove

83
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
these

84
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,120
relations you can also notice that if

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,320
one of the functions like for example

86
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,759
G is the uh is the is the simple

87
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,800
function gals

88
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:39,280
y

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,520
then uh the second row is just the

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,720
derivative of y with respect to X since

91
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,919
Y and X are independent variables that's

92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,800
zero and this the derivative of y with

93
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,320
respect to Y is one okay so that's zero

94
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,360
and one which leaves for the determinant

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,000
just this term here which is the partial

96
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:06,280
derivative of of f with respect to

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,039
X so this is a a useful identity because

98
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,160
you can pass from partial derivatives

99
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,440
that maybe you want to

100
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:18,199
evaluate to an equivalent Jacobian and

101
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,759
then we will see that we can manipulate

102
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,759
that uh

103
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,199
further of course if also f is equal to

104
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:32,160
X then this the is

105
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:36,120
becomes simply the entity I mean

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,280
one okay the other theorem about zius is

107
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,520
that if you consider a function of a

108
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,520
single variable and you invert the

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,000
function so you have f is a function of

110
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:51,880
X and you invert it as X as a function

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,400
of F you know that the derivative of

112
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,319
this inverted function is equal to the

113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,120
inverse of the derivative of the

114
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,240
original

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,479
function and the equivalent for a system

116
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,599
of uh um uh two functions of two

117
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,520
variables is that

118
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,520
the uh

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,039
Jacobian of the inverted

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,440
system when you solve the system this

121
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,720
system of equations to put in evidence X

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,520
and Y is a function on F of f and g so

123
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,840
you change the independent

124
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,240
variables uh and so you invert well the

125
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,360
uh Jacobian of the invert system is

126
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
equal to the inverse of the Jacobian of

127
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,759
the original

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,759
system and that also shows shows that if

129
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,240
you prove if you um choose the function

130
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,720
g y as

131
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:57,240
before gals y as before you can uh prove

132
00:06:49,720 --> 00:07:00,520
by this relation the fact that the uh

133
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:04,479
inverse I mean the partial derivative

134
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,599
of the inverse with respect to F at fix

135
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,560
Y is equal to the inverse of the

136
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,080
original partial

137
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,599
derivative so

138
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:21,319
formally you see this is uh X over y a

139
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,960
constant y let's read it Loosely well

140
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:27,440
you can just uh put uh it uh consider

141
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,520
the DX and the Dy consider it as a

142
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,680
fraction and put it under a the

143
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,599
denominator and you get this function

144
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,080
and uh it is fair in other words it

145
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:39,080
proves that you can do that easy uh

146
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,840
manipulation all right and the other

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,759
item is that if you have a function f of

148
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,280
x so X is your independent variable but

149
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,960
but suppose you want to represent your

150
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,599
independent variable as a in parametric

151
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,840
form so you have so X is a function of

152
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,960
another uh variable say a x of a so you

153
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,199
substitute in the function and so you

154
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,360
have a function of a function this is a

155
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,599
function of a now a has become the

156
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,639
independent

157
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,360
variable so the chain rule for

158
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,400
derivatives says for for single

159
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,960
variables that the derivative of f

160
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,000
respect to a is the derivative of s with

161
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,720
respect to x times the derivative of x

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,120
with respect to a okay the

163
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:31,440
equivalent for our system of two

164
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:36,200
variables uh so when you change your

165
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,800
system f and g uh in instead of as a

166
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,599
function of X and Y but is a function of

167
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,519
a and b so the X and Y are in turn

168
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,040
functions of a and

169
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:53,320
b um then you have a situation similar

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,720
to that and the derivative actually the

171
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,880
Jacobian of S and G with respect to the

172
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,440
new

173
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,440
variables you can is equal

174
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,680
to uh the Jacobian with respect to the

175
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,320
old variables times the Jacobian of the

176
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,959
new Vari of the old variables with

177
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,000
respect to the old

178
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:16,720
one and

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,720
formally you can

180
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,440
uh write this result suppose you delete

181
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:26,680
these two so you view

182
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,959
this result is simply the Jacobian of f

183
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,720
with respect to

184
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:34,160
a so you write it this way and then you

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,959
have empty spaces here where you can put

186
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,000
anything that cancels out so for example

187
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,399
you can put the Jacobian of XY with

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,600
respect to XY which is equal to one the

189
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,040
identity we just proved it

190
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,240
before and

191
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:57,440
th uh the formal manipulation becomes uh

192
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,680
uh easy now because uh then you

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,240
interpret this one as the Jacobian of f

194
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,920
with respect to XY and this is as the

195
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,920
Jacobian of XY with respect to

196
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
a

197
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:16,920
okay let's give an example that brings

198
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:20,760
us to a a a useful uh relation useful

199
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,360
identity for two properties that are uh

200
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,560
among the list that we have seen are

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,320
measurable so

202
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,000
take the

203
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,040
S determinant the determinant of the S

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,680
relation of the S Matrix of the

205
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:40,200
fundamental relation with respect to

206
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,440
entropy and volume so it's the Matrix of

207
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,880
the second order derivatives of energy

208
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,680
with respect to entropy and

209
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,040
volume now since

210
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,920
these second derivatives are derivatives

211
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,440
of for example we remember that the

212
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
derivative the first derivative of e

213
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,040
with respect to S is the temperature you

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,800
can also write them in this way

215
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,079
in terms of

216
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,920
the conjugate

217
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,839
variables temperature for entropy minus

218
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,000
the pressure for

219
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,160
volume okay so this is just uh applying

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,519
those

221
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,480
definitions and then here you recognize

222
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:27,360
that apart from the minus sign here that

223
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:30,399
can be uh taken to outside of the

224
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,120
determinant this is just the Coban of

225
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,839
temperature and pressure versus uh with

226
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,519
respect to S

227
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,320
snv so now let's do this trick of

228
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:47,079
Shifting the denominator leing the empty

229
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,079
spaces and let's put here whatever we

230
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:56,200
want so I'll do it in two ways I put

231
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,200
SNP here and

232
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:04,760
there okay and then I have I notice that

233
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,320
I have chosen my uh I make it make my my

234
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,000
choice so

235
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,240
that uh in each of these determinant I

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,199
mean

237
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,639
Jacobian there is a repeated U uh

238
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,760
pressure above and

239
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,680
below so that is the derivative of of t

240
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,920
with respect to S at constant

241
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,560
p and this other side has s which is

242
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,639
repeated

243
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,399
so that is the derivative of p with

244
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,399
respect to V at constant

245
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,000
s then if you look

246
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,079
up and I have let me remind it

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,320
here uh we Define the heat capacity at

248
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:55,720
constant uh pressure a few days ago and

249
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,399
and that was defined as the derivative

250
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,720
of the enthalpy with respect to

251
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:04,320
temperature at p

252
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,399
but if you look at how the enal the

253
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,519
differential for the enthalpy is if you

254
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:15,399
keep p and N constant DH is equal to

255
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,600
TDs so you can substitute the DH with

256
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:22,560
the TDS

257
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,320
here at constant pnn so CP or actually

258
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,639
you see here that the derivative of s

259
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,399
with respect to T at constant p is CP

260
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,560
over t

261
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,079
this derivative is therefore the inverse

262
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,760
of CP over

263
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:42,040
T why the inverse because we just Pro

264
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,880
that uh uh this derivative here is equal

265
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,800
to uh the inverse of its uh reciprocal

266
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,199
so to

267
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,920
speak also this other one we can

268
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:56,800
recognize as one of the properties that

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,800
we have defined or

270
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:03,600
almost by it's it's

271
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,000
the it's the derivative of V with

272
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,480
respect to pressure with the minus in

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,480
front so it's the

274
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,839
compressibility actually the other day

275
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,199
we defined the isothermal

276
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,720
compressibility so when you compress a

277
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:20,440
material at constant temperature but you

278
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,160
could also compress it at constant

279
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,160
entropy that defines the isentropic

280
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:35,399
compressibility and so here you

281
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:38,560
recognize the inverse of the isentropic

282
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,440
compressibility okay so first result is

283
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,320
that that this uh since the determinant

284
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,120
of the H determin of the H Matrix has uh

285
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,440
to be non negative by the conditions of

286
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,199
stability that we have uh already proved

287
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,440
we have this

288
00:14:54,199 --> 00:15:01,440
inequality but that's not the main um

289
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,240
object here I want to do now the same

290
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,639
but by substituting here in the empty

291
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,639
spaces another pair of

292
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,480
variables again in such a way that

293
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:18,560
numerator and denominator have one same

294
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,920
variable like here the temperature and

295
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,920
here the

296
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,240
volume then this becomes the partial of

297
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,880
p with respect to volume at constant

298
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,959
temperature and this becomes a partial

299
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,720
of t with respect to s set constant V

300
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,800
and by the

301
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,560
same definitions that we just reviewed

302
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,759
you can show that this is equal to T

303
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,680
over the heat capacity at constant

304
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:49,199
volume and this other is and this other

305
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,399
is uh one over the volume times the

306
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:56,560
isothermal compressibility also this

307
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,560
group must be greater than or equal to

308
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,160
zero but

309
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,199
since they came from the manipulation of

310
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,720
the same

311
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,360
stuff these groups must also be equal to

312
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,720
one

313
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,639
another and that by eliminating tnv

314
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,279
which sort of cancel when you if you

315
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,000
equate that to to

316
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:21,120
this you obtain this result that the

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,360
ratio of the heat

318
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,040
capacities constant pressure and volume

319
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,600
is equal to the ratio of the

320
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,440
compressibilities

321
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,279
temperature over entropy constant

322
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,000
entropy temperature versus constant uh

323
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,600
entropy for example if you

324
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,199
remember like for

325
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,519
air uh or for

326
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,160
a diatomic um

327
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,079
gas

328
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,480
ER CP how much is CP over

329
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,480
CV anybody

330
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,839
remembers for air

331
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:07,360
it's

332
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:10,880
1.4 it it is a

333
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,640
75th 7 over

334
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,559
5 okay so that

335
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:22,959
means that also the ratio of these

336
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,959
compressibilities is 1

337
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:31,320
over4 we will see uh uh in a while that

338
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,919
this gives us this has some importance

339
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,640
in in a practical application which is

340
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,440
uh the airs Springs that are used in

341
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,520
many

342
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,160
uh transport U device I mean Transport

343
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,200
Systems Like Trains uh trucks and cars

344
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,080
and so on and even

345
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,760
bicycles uh airs Springs okay

346
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,840
so but before we get to that uh let's

347
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,559
keep going with um another

348
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:08,240
uh relation that uh we can

349
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:11,440
prove by again using the properties of

350
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:16,400
jacobians and here is

351
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,400
a the situation in which you have a

352
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:24,400
surface for example a function of X Y

353
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,320
and Z equal Zer represents a surface

354
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,640
that you can represent in three

355
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,480
dimensions XYZ so

356
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,600
okay of course you can uh view that

357
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,360
surface from various points of view by

358
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,240
choosing what your base reference frame

359
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,919
is and what the independent variable is

360
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,280
so you can represent that uh surface

361
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:50,080
also in these three alternative

362
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:53,159
ways X is a function of X and why now

363
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,720
you see what I'm saying if I uh if I

364
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:59,320
have this

365
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:04,480
uh surface here

366
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:08,520
which is f of x y zal

367
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,919
z uh I can represent it for suppose this

368
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,000
is X Y and

369
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:18,679
Z okay so this is

370
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,200
also for every X and Y I have a value of

371
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:25,799
Z so I can view it as a function of X of

372
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:29,600
Z as a function of X and Y but I can

373
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:32,120
also view it also uh from here I fix X I

374
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:38,679
fix Z and that gives me a

375
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:42,080
y so that's y function of uh Z and x and

376
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:44,919
so on okay so these are alternative ways

377
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,320
of representing in in thermodynamics the

378
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:51,320
typical surface that is treated this way

379
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,120
is the pvt relation so the the equation

380
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,600
of

381
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,320
state that particular

382
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,840
equation uh that for a class of States

383
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,320
like single phase

384
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,280
States uh is equivalent to the uh

385
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,159
fundamental

386
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,919
relation and U and so it's useful

387
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,600
because it's in terms of easily measur

388
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,080
measurable properties like volume

389
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,080
temperature and

390
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,080
pressure

391
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:31,679
okay all right so here we do what do we

392
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,360
do we take take essentially ratios of

393
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,520
stuff that are equal to

394
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,520
one or actually say minus

395
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,480
one so say x

396
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,320
z uh and ZX the denominator by the

397
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,000
properties of determinants that's equal

398
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,720
to minus one if if I switch one uh one

399
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,240
column it changes

400
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,720
sign okay so I write this which are

401
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,400
easy identities then I rearrange them in

402
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:10,640
a in an in a more interesting way so

403
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:13,440
that again I have the same variable uh

404
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,320
numerator and denominator so for example

405
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,880
this is the partial of X with respect to

406
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,679
Y at constant Z this is the partial of X

407
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,400
with respect I'm sorry y with respect to

408
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,640
Z at constant X and this is partial of Z

409
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,960
respect to x constant

410
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,240
Y which is written here

411
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,640
and if you multiply minus one three

412
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,960
times you get minus one so this is

413
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,760
called the cyc cyclic relation and if

414
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,760
you apply it to

415
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,360
the uh pvt relation equation of State

416
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,360
here is what you

417
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,640
get and for example you could you could

418
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,400
apply it you remember that the one of

419
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,600
the Maxwell relations that we said could

420
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,679
be useful to measure entropy because it

421
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,799
has it gives a entropy

422
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,320
changes that you can measure by

423
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,760
measuring volume changes pressure

424
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,400
changes temperature changes at constant

425
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,760
temperature at constant volume so this

426
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:18,200
is somehow uh the basis of a an

427
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,320
instrument that you could call an

428
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,760
entropy

429
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,440
meter well by applying this cyclic

430
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,840
relation and I'm not going to the

431
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:34,799
details but I'll let you uh show

432
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,320
that um you prove that this derivative

433
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,159
is equal to the ratio of alpha p over

434
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:45,000
Capa T so it's the

435
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,440
um isobaric coefficient of expansion

436
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,600
Alpha over the isothermal

437
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,559
compressibility of your

438
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:59,120
material for example for a

439
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:02,120
gas I mean if I can write

440
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,120
the ideal gas

441
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:11,400
relation you can view that as a as a v

442
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,600
as a function of T and

443
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,600
P and

444
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,320
N right so it's

445
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,440
nrt over

446
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,440
P so it's easy to compute for example

447
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,600
Alpha

448
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,200
p Alpha p is 1 / V the derivative of V

449
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,240
with respect to

450
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,080
T at constant pressure so it's how much

451
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,679
the uh uh the

452
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,600
expansion for a given U increasing

453
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,919
temperature all right so it's one / V

454
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,840
the derivative of V of V with respect to

455
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,440
T is easy it's

456
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:03,240
NR over

457
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,240
p and if you use that again this is 1 /

458
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,480
T Capa

459
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,480
T is

460
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,880
minus 1 / V the derivative of V with

461
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:24,679
respect to P at constant

462
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,679
T all right we can also do that

463
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,880
derivative uh the derivative of this

464
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:29,840
with respect to p

465
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,399
is

466
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,080
minus

467
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:36,080
nrt / p ^

468
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,200
2 I apply that

469
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,159
again and the minus goes away with the

470
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,480
minus one V goes away I'm left with one

471
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,480
/

472
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,679
P so Alpha and Kappa for ideal gases are

473
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:05,039
relatively simple

474
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:10,360
and uh um and so this gives that that

475
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,360
derivative here is equal to P /

476
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,320
T okay for a

477
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,600
gas there is

478
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:29,039
another interesting

479
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,960
relation that you can prove

480
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,000
not so easily but relatively uh

481
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,000
straightforward by

482
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
using uh

483
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
the

484
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:47,480
jacobians it's the Mayer relation which

485
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:51,200
relates CP CV Alpha p and Capa

486
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,279
te and of course temperature and

487
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,840
volume and here you see this is just the

488
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:01,720
definition of CP

489
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,559
we write this derivative in terms of a

490
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,640
Jacobian with the with the property that

491
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:10,600
is kept constant repeated numerator and

492
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,600
do denominator then we shift leave the

493
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,679
empty space and then we search and now

494
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,840
the CH the choice of what to put there

495
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,200
is sort of a smart you have to have some

496
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,480
uh just trial and error or some

497
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,640
experience on how to choose

498
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,919
it but here if you for example we choose

499
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,600
to to to select T and

500
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,840
V the second one has a repeated um

501
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,720
variable numerator denominator so it is

502
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,039
a partial derivative and again we find

503
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,880
that it's related to Capa T the first

504
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:51,760
determinant has four different variables

505
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,760
so we write it here in terms of its

506
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,000
definition and then these various

507
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,919
entries can be recognized as

508
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,480
those properties for example this is CV

509
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,679
over

510
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,799
T

511
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:10,880
um this we just prove this Alpha over

512
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,919
Kappa

513
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,880
T this is the same because of the

514
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,960
symmetry of um of the S determinant and

515
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,679
or because of the max relations which is

516
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,960
the same and this is one over Capa T so

517
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,880
now you compute the determinant you get

518
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:33,799
that you place it here

519
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,799
and out comes to my

520
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,840
relation okay yeah so what what's the my

521
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,840
relation for a

522
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,799
gas what's the relation between c c

523
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,919
CP and CV for a for

524
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,480
gas no

525
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,320
what the

526
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,440
water how about

527
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,039
R the gas

528
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,039
constant

529
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:23,440
usually you don't do heat

530
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:28,360
capacities uh we we uh we you we do

531
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,720
specific Heats so that's CP small C is

532
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,480
Capital C over

533
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,760
n and uh CV small C heat

534
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,799
capacity I'm sorry specific heat is the

535
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,559
CV over

536
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:48,039
n and then the relation my relation is

537
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:52,760
that CP equals CV plus the gas constant

538
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:55,760
but let's prove it because we said that

539
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,559
U uh we have it there so we have we have

540
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,440
to compute V

541
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,440
uh what is it the VT Alpha

542
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:11,480
squ over Capa

543
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:13,600
T all right which is this term here

544
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,799
which is the difference between the two

545
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:22,480
capacitors so Alpha so that's

546
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:25,880
VT uh Alpha is 1 / T so got T squ

547
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,600
here and Kappa is one over P so I got a

548
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,399
p there

549
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:35,919
so that goes with that and hopefully

550
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:40,240
since PV is equal to an

551
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,240
nrt divided by T gives

552
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:53,919
NR I see a lot of rust in your minds

553
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,760
about about previous thermal that's

554
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,960
okay

555
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,960
uh all right

556
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,159
so done

557
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:09,600
with these properties I want to go back

558
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:13,760
to the subject of available

559
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,240
energy you remember what we've done

560
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,279
um I forget now if it was the previous

561
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,279
lecture or the one

562
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,399
before

563
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,360
um available

564
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,799
energy this is the setup in which I have

565
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,720
a system and a

566
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,399
reservoir and they undergo a a weight

567
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,320
process and we know that if the process

568
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,320
the weight process is

569
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:49,600
reversible uh we can

570
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:52,159
extract uh the maximum amount of energy

571
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,039
when the system ends in a in a mutual

572
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,600
equilibrium state with the environment

573
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,960
with the rest

574
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,000
work here is instead we are going to

575
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,440
adopt two different states two arbitrary

576
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,159
States so initial and

577
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:12,840
final and you ask yourself well if my

578
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:15,760
system has to go from A1 to

579
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,480
A2 and it has available the interaction

580
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,440
with the this thermal

581
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,559
Reservoir what is the maximum weight

582
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,919
lifted it can

583
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,919
do or if it cannot lift the weight

584
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,919
what is the minimum weight

585
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,080
lowering that is required so as to

586
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,080
achieve that

587
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:50,440
change and we have seen that um all any

588
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,880
I mean this class of problems what's the

589
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,840
maximum work what's the minimum

590
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,559
work are always solved by writing an

591
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,399
energy balance

592
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,720
an entropy

593
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,120
balance and also inserting as much as we

594
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,639
know about the properties of the systems

595
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,360
involved in this case we have a

596
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,960
reservoir for which we know the

597
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,440
fundamental relation is this linear

598
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,440
relationship between energy and

599
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:23,000
entropy and by the

600
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
way uh usually in

601
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,600
uh often I mean in in uh especially in

602
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,000
in the

603
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,360
physics language what we call thermal

604
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,880
Reservoir it's called The Heat

605
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:44,320
buff okay now you realize that uh we

606
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:47,760
defined uh uh the heat interaction so

607
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,159
that keep from a to

608
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,159
me uh so that

609
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,159
uh

610
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:02,240
the okay so that if you are I want how

611
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,240
much entropy is

612
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:09,960
transferred you get it because the ratio

613
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,720
between energy and entropy uh

614
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,039
transferred in a heat interaction is

615
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,279
equal to the temperature at which that

616
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,720
transfer

617
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,559
occurs

618
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,240
okay now the

619
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:28,360
reservoir you can write the fundamental

620
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,799
relation for the reservoir

621
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,799
uh this

622
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,159
way so you

623
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:47,519
see the why they call it heat buff

624
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:50,159
because the uh heat Reservoir is ready

625
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,600
to provide a heat interaction if you

626
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:58,559
extract energy at its

627
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:01,440
temperature uh then it provides also the

628
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,399
entropy and in in the right ratio so

629
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,320
that you have a heat interaction at the

630
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:07,639
temperature of the

631
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,320
reservoir so it's a heat buff in the

632
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:15,399
sense that it can provide uh heat I mean

633
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,399
so that's at least

634
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,800
justifies that's the reading of the ter

635
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:26,679
that's the my justification of that

636
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,679
language it is not a reservoir of heat

637
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:35,399
though in a in the sense that

638
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:37,520
heat is not a a form of energy it is a

639
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:41,440
form of energy

640
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,639
transfer you cannot store heat you store

641
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,679
energy okay you transfer energy in the

642
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,280
form of heat when you have an

643
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,839
interaction of that

644
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,240
form so the language is is important and

645
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,079
lose language is okay if you understand

646
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,400
what you're doing if it is too loose and

647
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:02,240
if you

648
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:06,359
assign to this language uh two popular

649
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,359
meaning then you get a lot of

650
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,720
confusion this is

651
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:15,440
why

652
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:19,200
I one of our objectives here is to try

653
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,200
to be as careful as possible with the

654
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:29,000
language and by the way uh my

655
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,560
um sincere congratulations for how good

656
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,560
you're doing in your uh

657
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,920
homeworks

658
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,640
okay

659
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,119
so the the

660
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,720
work that you by solving this system of

661
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,480
equations we already said that we we

662
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,160
find an expression for the

663
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:00,160
work which is uh H which is a term

664
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,800
related to irreversibility entropy

665
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,000
produced by irreversibility which is not

666
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,720
there if the process is reversible and

667
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,079
that's typically the best you can do

668
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:17,599
whether you have to spend energy or

669
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,800
produce uh um mechanical energy

670
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:24,480
uh you get the best always when you do

671
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,640
it uh reversibly so if you have to

672
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,280
extract energy if you can extract energy

673
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,720
you extract the max you should do the

674
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,720
reversable process if you have to spend

675
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,359
energy in order to obtain uh a change of

676
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:42,400
state for example heating up uh some

677
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:45,240
water it's a a task that requires uh

678
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,079
spending energy you can ask yourself

679
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:54,319
what is the minimum uh uh work that you

680
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:58,319
need to spend in order to heat up that

681
00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:01,000
uh that water

682
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:01,000
and if you do

683
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:08,079
that uh maybe when we do uh next time

684
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:11,079
the review on aies uh we

685
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,079
uh

686
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,440
we will'll see our efficient certain

687
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,440
ways we have to heat up

688
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,440
water

689
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,839
uh

690
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,839
okay now the maximum the reversible work

691
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:34,319
is the difference between the available

692
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:36,560
energies of the two uh states of your

693
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:39,880
system it's also the

694
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,520
difference in this availability function

695
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:47,000
gamma that is energy minus entropy

696
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,000
multiplied by the temperature of the

697
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,599
resare well called the availab canonical

698
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:57,720
AV availability function and that we

699
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,000
have seen that uh if you try to um

700
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,960
represented

701
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,480
graphically it acquires an absolute

702
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,520
minimum uh at the state in which a

703
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,800
system is in mutual equilibrium with the

704
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,440
reservoir so uh we by by exploiting this

705
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,200
this idea that this is a

706
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,760
minimum uh

707
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,720
we we extract information about for

708
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,119
example the

709
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,880
uh concavity of the

710
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,480
fundamental relation

711
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,839
By

712
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,160
devising changes so you start from this

713
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:40,119
uh Mutual equilibrium State and you move

714
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,760
anywhere else in uh an available one of

715
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,160
the possible states of your system a

716
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,119
wherever you

717
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,760
move gamma must

718
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:56,000
increase and so for example we chose uh

719
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,960
particular changes and we prove that uh

720
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,119
with those particular changes just you

721
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:05,680
can find that

722
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:10,240
uh the second differential of the

723
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:13,200
energy with respect to V and so fixed

724
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:17,280
sorry fixed then and V the second

725
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,520
differential so the concavity here is

726
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,319
positive you can do it also from the

727
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,119
other point of view so we say you find

728
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:29,000
that the second differential of s with

729
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:31,520
respect to uh at fixed vnn is negative

730
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,240
okay

731
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,000
now yeah we also apply that to prove uh

732
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,359
uh

733
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,640
but for example that the specific I mean

734
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,640
the heat capacities are uh non-

735
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:54,599
negative and we

736
00:39:50,839 --> 00:40:00,200
proved the first part this is just the

737
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,200
first part of the of the theorem by CH

738
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,359
Brown today we'll uh we'll do also a

739
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,400
second part which is

740
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,440
um even more

741
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,280
interesting so the first part was any

742
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,079
way that um if you if you perturb your

743
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,240
the state of your system which is

744
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,359
initially in mutual equilibrium with the

745
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,160
res you put it off the mutual

746
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,640
equilibrium by for example giving energy

747
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,440
the system will

748
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,599
react uh by increasing its temperature

749
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,760
and the temperature as we know is the

750
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,280
escaping tendency for energy so it

751
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,720
increases its willingness to give away

752
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,240
energy and since the reservoir is there

753
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,640
uh it is It prepares uh the increasing

754
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,280
in temperature

755
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,560
prepares uh the for the for a heat

756
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,960
interaction in which the system gives

757
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,760
energy to the

758
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,920
thereby

759
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,839
contrasting the change with which you

760
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,240
took it away from equilibrium it tries

761
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,240
to spontaneously return to equilibrium

762
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,240
by increasing its

763
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:22,000
temperature so that's one thing all

764
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,000
right so to to see a little

765
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:31,400
more uh let's broaden our

766
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,880
class or category of systems that we

767
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:38,800
call thermal reservoirs or say heat

768
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,520
Buffs because in practice we often have

769
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,560
also uh

770
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,560
reservoirs that are variable

771
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,000
volume

772
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,880
often the atmosphere where we live the

773
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,760
Environ is the environment and it's

774
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,599
something that would accept a change in

775
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,200
volume uh

776
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,079
uh

777
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,319
without if you if if if the changeing

778
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,440
volume is reasonably small and also the

779
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,040
changes in

780
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:13,720
energy are reasonably small uh you can

781
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,440
add or subtract the volume and energy to

782
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,960
the environment without changing its

783
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,280
temperature and

784
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,359
pressure so if the system is large

785
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:27,559
enough like the air uh in the

786
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,240
environment of of a town or the the the

787
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:33,760
water in the sea or in the lake or in a

788
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,480
river with respect to if it is if it is

789
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,760
large enough with respect to the amounts

790
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,599
of energies entropies and volume that

791
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:46,839
you exchange then you may consider that

792
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,680
as a as a thermal r word so A system

793
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:52,760
that maintains

794
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,160
fixed uh values of the temperature and

795
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,920
the pressure in this case we

796
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,319
consider system which has variable

797
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:06,119
volume but still the amounts are

798
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:11,599
fixed okay then the fundamental relation

799
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:15,119
for a system is also um

800
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:21,119
linear except that

801
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:24,960
now okay before we had the uh energy

802
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:28,760
entropy and this is the temperature

803
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:36,040
TR now if we add volume as a possibility

804
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:36,040
to change then okay let's see make to

805
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,520
this

806
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,480
then okay then we have an equation of

807
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,160
uh of the plane

808
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,200
of which the slopes are

809
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,839
TR when you take the slope at constant V

810
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,880
and minus P when you take the slope at

811
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,200
constant uh

812
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:17,359
s so this is equation of a of a plane

813
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:21,720
and that's the fundamental relation for

814
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,720
that thermal Reservoir at variable

815
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,800
volume so we ask the same question now

816
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,079
okay what

817
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,319
if I'm changing state for my

818
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:38,240
system but it exchanges volume what it

819
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:41,280
exchanges volume with the

820
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,000
reservoir so maybe the system changes s

821
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,480
the

822
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,520
volume and where does it take that

823
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,079
volume from the

824
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,920
reservoir or where does it give it to

825
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,559
the

826
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,079
reservoir you want to ask the maximum

827
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:01,359
work or the minimum work requirement for

828
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:04,359
doing that change well energy balance

829
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,480
entropy balance fundamental relation for

830
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:08,240
the reservoir and here you also have to

831
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,760
do a volume balance because you have an

832
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,680
additional variable that has to be kept

833
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:18,400
uh fixed for the composite

834
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,880
system the overall volume is

835
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,559
concerned in order to have no other

836
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,760
effect external

837
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,920
effects like in a weight

838
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,240
process okay

839
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,520
so when you do the Sol when you solve

840
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,839
this problem

841
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,800
by eliminating the variables that um

842
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:41,040
relate to the

843
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,920
resir here's the

844
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,520
result it's almost like before except

845
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,760
that there is now an extra term here

846
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:55,079
which is PR times the difference in

847
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:57,880
volume of your system and again it's a

848
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:02,079
reversible term minus

849
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,079
a term related to

850
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:11,720
irreversibility the reversible term can

851
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:14,400
be seen as the difference in two

852
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,480
um

853
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,000
properties you could consider this as a

854
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:24,040
definition of another property that we

855
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,800
still call for short of names um

856
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,800
available energy with respect to that

857
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:32,559
particular Reservoir in that variable

858
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:37,440
volume it's it's like the one

859
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:40,359
before plus this additional P * Delta

860
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,480
V and also this one if you as you notice

861
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:46,400
may be written as a

862
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:49,079
difference in an availability function e

863
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,359
minus TRS plus P

864
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:57,920
RV which we're going to call uh just

865
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,920
with the name capital c

866
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:05,040
and we may notice

867
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,920
that this is

868
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,079
not it looks like but it's not the GS

869
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,760
free

870
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:16,200
energy except when the system is in

871
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,760
mutual equilibrium in the state of

872
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,839
mutual equilibrium with the

873
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:25,200
environment in that case TR is also the

874
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:28,839
temperature of your system a and

875
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,839
therefore this is the Gibs free energy

876
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:38,319
whereas uh in any other

877
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:42,920
state this TR this PR may not

878
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:47,200
be the uh temperature of your system

879
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:49,960
a and actually if the state is not an

880
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,000
equilibrium State the temp the system a

881
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,720
might not even have a temperature

882
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,640
defined actually it does not if it is

883
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,480
not stable equilibrium yet this

884
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,800
availability function is

885
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,319
defined and it gives

886
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:11,880
you these answers to questions of

887
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:15,079
minimum or maximum uh work to do or to

888
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,079
uh to

889
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:28,599
obtain yes exactly with the same

890
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:30,200
procedure that we have done to

891
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,119
obtain

892
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:37,480
these conditions for the

893
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:40,800
stability you can do it also here now I

894
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,720
since I have several variables it's not

895
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,400
uh I'm sorry let me go back one moment

896
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,800
here

897
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,359
okay so you you should think of a

898
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,599
similar procedure only in a

899
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:56,880
three-dimensional setup in which you

900
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:58,920
start from a mutual equilibrium state

901
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,040
and you

902
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,200
move away from it and then you apply the

903
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,200
condition that gamma must

904
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,280
increase if you move away now whereas

905
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,480
here you could move

906
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,480
away only on the e s

907
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:24,480
plane in the new uh setup where also the

908
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:27,280
Val volume is CH is uh is is is can be

909
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:31,559
changed yes you can move

910
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,680
at constant uh V or constant e or but

911
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,480
you can also move in any other direction

912
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,920
so you have more

913
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:44,240
choices and whatever choice you make you

914
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:47,960
still have to have this property to

915
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,960
uh uh

916
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,119
increase so here I let you if you're

917
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:58,520
interested watch the

918
00:49:54,119 --> 00:50:02,079
details I choose a a uh for example to

919
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:06,200
move by changing the entropy and the

920
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,280
volume keeping keeping the N fixed and

921
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,960
it turns out that when you compute the

922
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:14,760
change in the variable Fe it is exactly

923
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,280
equal to a half the second differential

924
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,440
of

925
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,720
e uh and therefore you prove that this

926
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,480
is greater than equal to

927
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,280
zero or if I choose instead to change

928
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,119
the energy and volume and therefore and

929
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,720
to move along the stable equilibrium

930
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:35,160
State curve so that the entropy is

931
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,520
determined by the fundamental relation

932
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,960
then Delta V becomes equal to minus the

933
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:43,480
second differential of the

934
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:50,160
entropy and since that must be greater

935
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:54,520
than zero it it gives again that

936
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:57,280
d2s is at fixed n now this

937
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:59,160
d2s now

938
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,240
if you want to represent

939
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:05,480
it it's not just the second

940
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,000
derivative

941
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:13,440
uh because you

942
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:17,520
see when we have D d2s at constant V and

943
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,599
N this was equal to the second

944
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:26,440
derivative of s with respect to

945
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:26,440
e times the e s

946
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:34,200
but this other

947
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:36,000
d2s at constant n only you can vary both

948
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:40,559
e and s

949
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,280
then uh it's given by d2s with respect

950
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,880
to

951
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:50,440
e^2 time e

952
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:52,839
squar plus twice the second derivative

953
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:57,400
of s with respect to e and with respect

954
00:51:52,839 --> 00:52:01,920
to V times d e

955
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:08,520
DV plus the second with respect to

956
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:12,280
V twice times DV squ so it's a quadratic

957
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:17,680
form which you can express also in terms

958
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:21,480
of the uh in in in this form uh like

959
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:24,520
using matrices D

960
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:29,559
DV here you put the S determinant which

961
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,559
is the determinant made up of the second

962
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:43,599
derivatives okay and this is

963
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,599
equal and then you multiply this by this

964
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:49,319
other Vector made up of two

965
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:53,000
elements D and DV if you do matrix

966
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:57,799
multiplication of of this let's be more

967
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:00,799
uh elegant here uh you get the above

968
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,799
result

969
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:12,520
okay and the fact that this has to be

970
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:17,079
negative for arbitrary so this has to

971
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:21,040
be uh negative for arbitrary choice of

972
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:23,599
your vector D DV which

973
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:27,680
means no matter what direction you want

974
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:29,799
to move uh uh

975
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:33,119
this has to be

976
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:37,079
negative that requires that the Matrix

977
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,079
inside be no negative

978
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:43,079
definite and the Matrix is non negative

979
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,920
definite

980
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:52,799
when I me I mean sorry sorry non

981
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:58,440
positive non so it's it's negative

982
00:53:52,799 --> 00:53:58,440
semide definite okay so when is a matrix

983
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:05,880
uh let's start with positive when is a

984
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,880
matrix positive

985
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:17,920
definite I have a matrix a 1 one

986
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,799
a12 and let's make it symmetric

987
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,520
okay so

988
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:39,200
this if it is positive semide

989
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:46,160
definite the diagonal entries must be

990
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,160
non-

991
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:56,680
negative the

992
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:59,599
determinant must be non- negative so a 1

993
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:02,680
1 a22 minus

994
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:07,720
a12 squared because it's a

995
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,720
symmetric must be greater than equal to

996
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,559
zero you want to make it uh uh if the

997
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,000
Matrix instead of

998
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,960
being positive semi-definite is negative

999
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,200
semi-definite so this is less than or

1000
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,200
equal to

1001
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:35,559
so the

1002
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:39,440
entries on the diagonal should

1003
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:39,440
be non NE non

1004
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:47,480
positive how about the

1005
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,480
determinant should I change the

1006
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:58,240
sign not for a 2X two

1007
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,240
Matrix because you see also

1008
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:06,160
the more uh fundamental way uh property

1009
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,200
of of a non negative uh of a a nonos

1010
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:15,039
of of a negative semide definite Matrix

1011
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:16,680
is that it's igen values are

1012
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,880
all

1013
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:22,839
negative so it means let's say let's

1014
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:28,240
call them Lambda so Lambda 1 is less

1015
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:28,240
than zero Lambda 2 is less than zero

1016
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:39,280
and for a 2x2 matrix the

1017
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:42,160
determinant is equal to the product of

1018
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:46,480
the two L values so this is also equal

1019
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,520
to Lambda 1 time Lambda 2 so if you

1020
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,720
multiply two negative numbers you get a

1021
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:54,799
positive number and so you

1022
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:59,000
get the determinant is greater than zero

1023
00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:01,559
If instead you you add a 3 by 3x3 Matrix

1024
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,880
then you have three negative numbers

1025
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:04,640
that multiplied give the determinant in

1026
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:10,119
that

1027
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:12,319
case with an odd number of uh entries uh

1028
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:15,880
negative time negative time negative

1029
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:18,559
makes Nega right so the determinant of

1030
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:24,000
of of the uh

1031
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:28,319
semi uh of a negative semide definite

1032
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,559
Matrix is positive for odd number of uh

1033
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:35,039
rows and columns and uh negative for uh

1034
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,319
what did it say positive for even number

1035
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:40,319
and negative for odd

1036
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:40,319
number

1037
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,520
okay we need that in a short

1038
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:59,640
while here oh yeah let me just uh

1039
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:03,680
go back to like

1040
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,680
a a simple

1041
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,760
um

1042
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,559
question

1043
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,200
about all right suppose you

1044
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:27,079
have you have vacuum so you have a

1045
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:30,720
piston you have a a

1046
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:34,280
container in which you manage to have

1047
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,319
nothing vacuum vacuum means no particles

1048
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,160
nothing

1049
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,160
okay so the question

1050
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:49,280
is is that a

1051
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:52,319
situation and this vacuum is in a uh in

1052
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:56,760
an environment which I can

1053
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:58,720
model as a reservoir

1054
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:02,720
at pressure

1055
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:05,240
PR yeah also temperature TR but uh the

1056
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:09,119
temperature doesn't play much over Ro

1057
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:11,880
here so it's like I have this container

1058
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,880
in the environment here man I manage to

1059
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,160
make

1060
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,920
vacuum what's the minimum work required

1061
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:23,000
to make that

1062
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:25,599
vacuum or if I have that vacuum can I do

1063
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,480
something useful can I lift the weight

1064
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,480
what's the maximum uh

1065
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,640
lift well let's

1066
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,640
apply this formula

1067
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:47,960
here assume that we do things the best

1068
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,079
thermodynamic way so that means without

1069
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,079
generating entropy by

1070
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:58,000
irreversibility and suppose I want my

1071
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:01,640
initial state state one

1072
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,280
okay so let me say that I started with

1073
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:09,119
my piston down below

1074
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:11,920
here and now so this is my say State one

1075
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:15,240
and this is my state

1076
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,240
two and I

1077
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,920
pull here I have the

1078
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:27,520
pressure of the

1079
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,520
environment so if I pull

1080
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:33,559
how much work do I have to do I have to

1081
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,359
the if you look at the piston on one

1082
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:39,400
side you have zero pressure because

1083
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,400
nothing here on the other side you have

1084
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:48,720
PR so if you if the the

1085
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:48,720
volume change is vs2 minus

1086
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:59,319
V1 you can view that as

1087
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:03,720
a that's let's call X this

1088
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:06,559
uh the loc let's call Z the location of

1089
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:10,799
the of the weight I'm sorry of the

1090
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:13,119
piston and let's call Little a the area

1091
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,119
of the

1092
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,559
Piston

1093
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:26,680
so the

1094
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:31,039
force that you have to apply is equal

1095
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:35,920
to the pressure times which is force per

1096
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:38,440
unit area times the area so that's the

1097
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,520
force the

1098
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,680
work is

1099
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:46,640
f time

1100
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,640
x Force I'm sorry

1101
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:57,440
Z

1102
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:59,720
right uh so that's p

1103
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:04,000
r time a

1104
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:10,279
z but a z is the volume so that's p r *

1105
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:14,200
V but actually it's V2 minus V1 because

1106
01:02:10,279 --> 01:02:18,119
uh this is V2 and this is V1 is equal to

1107
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,119
zero in in our case

1108
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:23,599
so it seems that the

1109
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:29,960
work that you need to spend B in order

1110
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:34,559
to go from one to two in a reversible

1111
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:37,119
way is equal to

1112
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:40,839
that which is written

1113
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,839
here except that

1114
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:49,279
now it has the wrong

1115
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:52,640
sign because this represents the work

1116
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:55,119
with the arrow out

1117
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:58,079
instead we are spend if we change the

1118
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:01,559
direction of the the arrow so me say

1119
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,559
that this is the work that I need to

1120
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:04,559
spend

1121
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:11,240
okay and of course this I could also

1122
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:11,240
write at the same

1123
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:17,799
thing by changing the arrow if I change

1124
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,799
the arrow I change also the

1125
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:23,000
sign

1126
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:25,400
okay so essentially the the the the

1127
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,319
minimum work to required to produce the

1128
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:32,079
vacuum is equal to the pressure of the

1129
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:36,079
environment times the volume of that

1130
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:38,119
vacuum that's an easy result we could

1131
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,799
have I mean we actually got to that

1132
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:44,200
result without all the complicated uh

1133
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:46,480
long story that we are telling

1134
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:51,599
but that's just

1135
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:56,520
to uh show what uh the consistency of

1136
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,520
this relation we what we what we know

1137
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:07,200
so now let's think of another kind of uh

1138
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:16,240
Reservoir which again can be uh

1139
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:23,119
typically is a typical model of the a

1140
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:23,119
environment or the or or some natural uh

1141
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,480
environment so here is a particular

1142
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:32,160
Reservoir that can exchange through a

1143
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:34,400
semi perable membrane only one type of

1144
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,799
substance with your

1145
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:41,200
system we may we may call it the an

1146
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:45,319
osmotic Reservoir or a thermal Reservoir

1147
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,319
or we just not don't give any

1148
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:53,720
names but just Define it uh uh by just

1149
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,079
these words all

1150
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:58,480
right you run the same machine machery

1151
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:01,400
energy balance entropy balance now you

1152
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,520
also have to make a balance for the

1153
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:08,319
amounts of constituents of the kind of

1154
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,319
substance that can be uh

1155
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:16,279
transferred for example you

1156
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,720
can you may be

1157
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:25,839
interested in U you know some people are

1158
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:29,359
devising uh devising um methods or or U

1159
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:30,160
uh plants that want to extract CO2 from

1160
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,799
the

1161
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:35,640
atmosphere right so you want to ask well

1162
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:41,200
what's the minimum amount of work I need

1163
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:42,520
to spend if I want to uh extract CO2

1164
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,720
from the

1165
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,160
atmosphere because that minimum defines

1166
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,799
the

1167
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:54,200
target defines also the way in which you

1168
01:05:50,799 --> 01:06:00,799
determine the efficiency the second low

1169
01:05:54,200 --> 01:06:00,799
efficiency of that uh particular uh

1170
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:07,039
equipment and it's a question very

1171
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:10,200
similar to this one because one

1172
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:13,880
way one way to do

1173
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:16,160
that uh not saying it's the reversible

1174
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:19,000
way but I'm saying that one way to do it

1175
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,000
is first you do

1176
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,760
vacuum and

1177
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:27,960
then you open

1178
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,000
up the permeability of the Piston to C

1179
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:33,480
just

1180
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,839
CO2 and so CO2 will fill this

1181
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:39,880
region and you'll have just CO2 because

1182
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:43,279
the other parts the other mean O oxygen

1183
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,079
and nitrogen cannot go through uh this

1184
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:47,400
particular semi-permeable membrane and

1185
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,680
that way you have

1186
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:57,520
separated so one way is produce vacuum

1187
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:57,520
and we know how much it work it requires

1188
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:04,480
use a semi-perm membrane and there you

1189
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:06,960
have your your uh CO2 your CO2

1190
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,440
eventually will reach Mutual equilibrium

1191
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,200
with the reservoir and

1192
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:16,039
uh

1193
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:21,240
uh so if you at that stage I have

1194
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:23,359
blocked my piston cannot go up and down

1195
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,200
and I change Reservoir instead of having

1196
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:30,079
a reservoir at variable volume

1197
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:33,960
I have a reservoir at uh that can

1198
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:38,720
exchange that so at constant chemical

1199
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,720
potential of that substance

1200
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:48,279
CO2

1201
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:51,720
okay uh the final state will be that

1202
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:55,599
instead of vacuum I will just have CO2

1203
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:58,680
pure let's say that this will have a

1204
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,119
chemical potential that we will

1205
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:04,240
call MU

1206
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:06,440
I and it will have a pressure that

1207
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,359
corresponds to what we

1208
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,079
defined when they are in mutual

1209
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:13,279
equilibrium equality of chemical

1210
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,880
potentials defines the partial

1211
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:20,880
pressure so the CO2 will be at the

1212
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:23,000
partial pressure that it has in air

1213
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:27,000
viewed as a

1214
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
mixture okay

1215
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:32,319
this second part of the process from

1216
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,759
when I after I made vacuum and I stop

1217
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:39,880
the piston and I open the pory uh the

1218
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:42,120
second part of the process is

1219
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,920
spontaneous because

1220
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:48,040
initially you are in non equilibrium

1221
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,400
State because here you have no CO2

1222
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:52,279
whereas in order for a equilibrium you

1223
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:56,719
need to have chemical potentials to be

1224
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:58,000
equal so this is an irreversible process

1225
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,679
there will be entropy produced by

1226
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,759
reversibility so this is not the best

1227
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:06,199
way to do it you could also evaluate how

1228
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:10,040
much is the efficiency if you could

1229
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:12,799
compare it with what's the minimum work

1230
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,199
that is required and the minimum work

1231
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,359
that is

1232
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:20,000
required is given

1233
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:22,679
here by this formula here I'm Sorry by

1234
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,279
this formula

1235
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:29,839
here so there is again another

1236
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:34,000
um available energy

1237
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:34,000
function I'm sorry available energy

1238
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:40,159
property for this particular kind of

1239
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,159
osmotic

1240
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:47,759
reservoirs the difference of which tells

1241
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:52,239
you the minimum or the maximum

1242
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:55,440
works for producing or or exploiting and

1243
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:55,440
the situation

1244
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:03,800
so we'll return later on uh to this

1245
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:09,239
question of minimum work for separating

1246
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,239
a substance from uh from from say the

1247
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,480
atmosphere

1248
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,800
here this combination that appears in

1249
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:23,760
the expression for this new version of

1250
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:26,120
the available energy namely e minus TRS

1251
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,760
minus the chemical potential

1252
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:32,199
times the amount of that substance that

1253
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:36,920
is can cross between the system and the

1254
01:10:32,199 --> 01:10:38,880
reservoir we may give it a name or not

1255
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:41,360
simply an availability

1256
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,600
function maybe we could call it osmotic

1257
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,960
availability function maybe we could use

1258
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,760
this letter or another letter uh it's

1259
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,760
just a matter of

1260
01:10:53,320 --> 01:11:02,440
choice as for for the other availability

1261
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:06,640
functions this also is

1262
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:08,800
minimum so also from this one you can

1263
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:13,000
derive by the

1264
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,000
same method as before same

1265
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,520
procedure conditions for stability of

1266
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:25,080
equilibrium for the second differential

1267
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:29,159
of the energy now it will be like uh uh

1268
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:34,600
this is but not with volume but with NI

1269
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:34,600
I uh that substitutes and that's the

1270
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:40,679
uh the the the expression for this

1271
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,679
second order

1272
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:49,960
differentials and finally we could have

1273
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:52,960
a grand situation okay so Grand

1274
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,960
Reservoir

1275
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:57,719
um with which

1276
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,199
you can your system can exchange

1277
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:05,400
anything it

1278
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:05,400
wants amounts volume energy and

1279
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,600
entropy

1280
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:14,239
okay so you have to run again the same

1281
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:16,239
Machinery energy balance entropy balance

1282
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,960
fundamental relation for the

1283
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:21,400
reservoir notice that PO in the previous

1284
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,040
case maybe I didn't emphasize it enough

1285
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,800
but what changes from Reservoir to

1286
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:28,239
Reservoir is the

1287
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:32,480
expression for the fundamental relation

1288
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:35,480
see these uh terms are

1289
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:38,960
new peculiar to this

1290
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:41,239
Reservoir that acts as a reservoir not

1291
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,760
only for exchanges of energy and entropy

1292
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:45,440
but also for if you change volume it

1293
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,199
doesn't change the pressure if you

1294
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,679
change the amounts it doesn't change the

1295
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,679
chemical

1296
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,679
potentials and then you have to uh

1297
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:02,080
remember also to do the

1298
01:12:56,679 --> 01:13:05,600
volume balance and the balance balances

1299
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:07,639
for all of the amounts of the various

1300
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,840
constituents that are

1301
01:13:07,639 --> 01:13:11,840
conserved now chemical reactions

1302
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:20,679
here again eliminate

1303
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:23,600
the terms that relate to

1304
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:26,800
the reservoir and you get this

1305
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,600
expression which is a

1306
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:32,480
another generalization of the available

1307
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:37,840
energy with respect to this completely

1308
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:41,920
open uh Reservoir and uh it's

1309
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:44,120
um this is the available energy the

1310
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:48,080
expression which can also be written as

1311
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:50,679
a difference in two

1312
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,320
values so the the work the maximum or

1313
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:55,960
minum the reversible work is the

1314
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:58,000
difference in the values of this new

1315
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:00,400
availability function which I like to

1316
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,639
call Oiler availability function for the

1317
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:08,719
reason I already explained uh the other

1318
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:10,280
time and that will be also clear uh

1319
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:16,000
later

1320
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:19,080
on so this e minus TRS plus PV minus mu

1321
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,480
RN this availability function is defined

1322
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:26,040
for all states equilibrium and non-e

1323
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:27,840
equilibrium when your system is

1324
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:31,960
in

1325
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:35,560
uh neutal equilibrium so so it is in the

1326
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:37,840
state at temperature TR pressure PR and

1327
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,840
with the chemical potential so complete

1328
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:44,520
equilibrium between system and

1329
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,679
Reservoir then this availability

1330
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,639
function we corresponds to that

1331
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,600
characteristic function that we called

1332
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:55,880
the

1333
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,880
oiler free energy

1334
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:02,880
that I just reviewed at the beginning of

1335
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:06,600
today

1336
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,600
okay and from this

1337
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,480
one this

1338
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,080
also is

1339
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,080
minimum at Mutual

1340
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:23,320
equilibrium and you can do the same

1341
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,320
again

1342
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:32,080
uh to EXT ract

1343
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:33,880
conditions for stability this

1344
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:38,239
time this

1345
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:41,239
expression D2 e is with respect not to

1346
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:44,159
just two variables so this

1347
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:49,199
Matrix uh the S Matrix will not be just

1348
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:51,239
2 by two but will be uh 2 + r because y

1349
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:53,679
also also can change all the

1350
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:58,600
constituents and if the our constituents

1351
01:15:53,679 --> 01:16:01,560
is like a 2X two 2+ R by 2+ R so it's

1352
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,920
this Matrix that we have already

1353
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:08,400
anticipated a while

1354
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:12,280
ago and uh this therefore

1355
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:15,840
proves uh I mean here the details here

1356
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:20,159
prove in more detail

1357
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,159
also these expression that we had

1358
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,560
anticipated but you can also choose

1359
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:33,480
since now you you are you think that you

1360
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:37,040
are in a in a the mutual equilibrium

1361
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:40,679
State and then you can move your

1362
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:43,920
State uh in various

1363
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:46,040
directions and one

1364
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:49,159
way is that

1365
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:51,280
you choose another

1366
01:16:49,159 --> 01:16:55,159
state

1367
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:57,639
that has still has the same temperature

1368
01:16:55,159 --> 01:16:59,080
pressure of your reservo but you change

1369
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:02,320
the

1370
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,679
amount so you choose to move away from

1371
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,520
Mutual

1372
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,120
equilibrium because the conditions for

1373
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,600
Mutual equilibrium with res is not only

1374
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:13,760
now that it can exchange not only energy

1375
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:16,000
but also amounts it's not only the

1376
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,480
temperature equality it's also the

1377
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,639
pressure equality for the volume change

1378
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:25,639
and the chemical potentials or chemical

1379
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:28,239
potential so I can move away from Mutual

1380
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:30,520
equilibrium while keeping some of the

1381
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:32,960
mutual equilibrium conditions satisfied

1382
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:36,360
like same temperature and same pressure

1383
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,360
and moving only the

1384
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:44,639
amounts if you do that and move along uh

1385
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:47,760
the stable equilibrium State surface

1386
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:47,760
constant temperature and

1387
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:56,840
pressure uh the condition that Delta uh

1388
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,840
that that uh this um

1389
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:05,600
Oiler uh availability

1390
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:10,400
function must increase along that

1391
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:12,080
path turns out to be the change in this

1392
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:16,239
variable

1393
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:19,480
side is uh equal to the second

1394
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,480
differential of the Gibs free

1395
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,560
energy you you can prove it by

1396
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:29,639
remembering that the

1397
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:32,920
the Gibs V energy is e minus s minus TR

1398
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:36,440
and here TR and PR remain remain

1399
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,440
constant so it it remains

1400
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:45,480
defined so this proves that um the

1401
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:49,600
Gibs free

1402
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:52,920
energy as a minimum if you move so the

1403
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:56,120
second differential is non negative yes

1404
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:57,960
it's is non negative h if you move at

1405
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:00,560
con if you change the composition at

1406
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,560
constant

1407
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:11,440
tnp if you keep only temperature fixed

1408
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:15,360
and change the volume instead of keeping

1409
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:17,560
the pressure constant you get a similar

1410
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,480
relation this is not the givs free

1411
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:25,199
energy it's the elol free

1412
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:25,199
energy at constant t

1413
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:39,880
okay so remember that we have seen

1414
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:43,120
the that from these conditions here we

1415
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:46,080
obtain first part of the brown

1416
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,679
principle

1417
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:51,159
now

1418
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:52,080
yes another little piece of math sorry

1419
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:55,679
about

1420
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:57,520
that uh

1421
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,280
but that will get us to the second part

1422
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:03,960
of the chatellier brown principle so it

1423
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:06,120
is which is a more General uh

1424
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:10,199
statement

1425
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:16,120
which requires a little um uh brush

1426
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:19,120
up or maybe first time you see

1427
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,120
math

1428
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:28,679
uh so let's say we have a function

1429
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:31,440
for of two variables I put also the the

1430
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:33,480
other Z here just to say that the z's

1431
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,320
are going to be constant so I have

1432
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:39,560
several variables but I

1433
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:42,800
keep a constant all except two of them

1434
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,800
which are X and

1435
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:50,159
Y and then for example I have that

1436
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,159
function I can write the

1437
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:54,840
differential so that's the partial of a

1438
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,120
with respect to X

1439
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:59,920
time DX times the partial of a with

1440
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:04,560
respect to y * d y I'm going to use the

1441
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:08,199
notation comma X for partial with

1442
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:10,480
respect to X which is often used like in

1443
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:14,199
fluid mechanics so maybe you've seen it

1444
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,199
already or

1445
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:23,400
elsewhere and for example comma X is the

1446
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:27,239
second derivative with respect to X

1447
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:32,239
twice uh comma XY is the derivative of

1448
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:32,239
uh with respect to X and with respect to

1449
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:38,400
Y

1450
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:40,239
okay so this is the partial derivative

1451
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:45,520
with respect to

1452
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:47,080
X and here's the full Glory of uh the um

1453
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,840
representation of that

1454
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:54,800
derivatives uh where where the subs as

1455
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,800
you remember mean the other variables

1456
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:59,199
of the original function that you're

1457
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:01,679
taking the deriv the partial derivative

1458
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:04,320
of okay

1459
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:08,639
good then we

1460
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,760
have like we've seen there for d2s

1461
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:13,719
here's

1462
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:17,080
D2 of this variable

1463
01:22:13,719 --> 01:22:19,800
a can think of s but it could be also

1464
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:21,800
others like the gifts fre energy or or

1465
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:24,800
the elos free energy or whatever you

1466
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,800
need

1467
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:29,360
and this is the quadratic

1468
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,239
form

1469
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:34,800
that represents the explicit

1470
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:37,000
form of the

1471
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,960
uh second or

1472
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,239
differential okay so now that we have a

1473
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:45,199
quadratic

1474
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:48,800
form the trick is to put it in the

1475
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:51,080
so-called canonical form because you see

1476
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:54,679
this quadratic

1477
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:57,400
form has a square here a square there

1478
01:22:54,679 --> 01:23:03,040
and then it has a product DX

1479
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:03,040
Dy this isn't doesn't have a a definite

1480
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:09,280
sign

1481
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:12,880
but let's try to rewrite this quadratic

1482
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:14,239
form into a form in which you have

1483
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:18,560
something

1484
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:21,080
squared and uh Dy squared so a

1485
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,159
combination of DX and Dy proper

1486
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,960
combinate if you choose a proper

1487
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:27,679
combination of DX and D

1488
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:30,000
y uh and this is the proper combination

1489
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,120
I already built in the the answer so you

1490
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,960
if you want to check it you just

1491
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:38,719
substitute if you if you take this

1492
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,400
expression and work it out you will

1493
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:42,800
prove to yourself that it's equivalent

1494
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,800
to that

1495
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:48,639
one and this ratio this coefficient here

1496
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:51,600
is the ratio

1497
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:53,800
of uh the second derivative with respect

1498
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,679
to XY and divided by the second

1499
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,679
derivative respect to

1500
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:04,800
xx and then you find if you substitute

1501
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:07,679
by comparison you find that what you

1502
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:11,360
need to put in front of the Dy squ is

1503
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:15,280
this Lambda which is not sorry that I

1504
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:15,280
used Lambda here it's not the a

1505
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:22,480
values but this

1506
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:26,679
Lambda is given by this

1507
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:30,159
expression again terms of the

1508
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:32,800
original you can do it in this way where

1509
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:36,239
in your summation you get you keep the

1510
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:38,280
square of the Y squared or you can do it

1511
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:40,440
also in this other way this is another

1512
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:42,280
canonical form in which you keep the X

1513
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:44,960
squar they

1514
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:47,400
are two equivalent

1515
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,360
ways of course here the Lambda is

1516
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,520
different than the Lambda X is given by

1517
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,520
this

1518
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,960
one okay

1519
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:02,040
now do I have more

1520
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,520
space

1521
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,639
now let's look at

1522
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:17,840
uh

1523
01:25:13,639 --> 01:25:22,320
suppose that our function a is such that

1524
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:26,080
it's uh second differential must be

1525
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:30,280
positive okay

1526
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:34,199
so positive

1527
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:37,400
means that this Matrix is positive

1528
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:37,400
definite or semide

1529
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:46,960
definite and as as we remember yeah I

1530
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:52,840
took away the wrong so if we

1531
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:55,520
remember uh positive definite for a

1532
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,360
matrix imply

1533
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,840
all these things are

1534
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,840
positive or non

1535
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:13,280
negative so we have to have that

1536
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:15,760
axx is greater than

1537
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,440
zero and in fact here that's what I have

1538
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,760
written

1539
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:23,280
axx is greater than zero it's greater

1540
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:27,360
than something else is greater than zero

1541
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,360
and also a y I is greater than

1542
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:32,760
zero

1543
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:34,760
but here we have written also something

1544
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:39,719
more strong than

1545
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:42,560
that we have written that a XX or a y y

1546
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:44,880
is greater than

1547
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,760
Lambda let's

1548
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:50,000
see

1549
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:50,000
um the

1550
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:56,000
Lambda uh

1551
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:58,040
Tai yeah I can write it

1552
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,199
there

1553
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:02,199
um see for example Lambda

1554
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:10,639
y let me rewrite it uh this way uh it

1555
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:14,600
has that the

1556
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,600
denominator a xx

1557
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:22,920
squ and at the denominate I'm sorry at

1558
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:25,800
the yeah denominator there and numerator

1559
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:27,760
a XX time

1560
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:31,320
a y

1561
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:33,679
y minus a

1562
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:36,840
XY

1563
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:41,159
squar that is the

1564
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,159
determinant of the S

1565
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:44,440
Matrix that

1566
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,679
numerator

1567
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:59,199
so since the Matrix is positive the

1568
01:27:56,679 --> 01:28:02,239
numerator is positive the denominator is

1569
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:05,119
positive so this is also

1570
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:10,320
positive

1571
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:10,320
okay so Lambda so this explains why

1572
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:15,000
Lambda uh you can do that for y but also

1573
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:21,320
for

1574
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:21,320
x uh the lambdas are also non

1575
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:29,840
negative and now you can also see here y

1576
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:35,239
Lambda uh for example Lambda

1577
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:37,760
Y is smaller than a y y because you look

1578
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:40,080
look here this is lamb this is a and

1579
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,760
then you subtract something

1580
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:44,600
positive so if if you from a you

1581
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:50,000
subtract something positive it means

1582
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:52,719
that Lambda is smaller than a i a y

1583
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,360
y

1584
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,920
okay all right so this is the

1585
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:01,080
mathematics that uh

1586
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:06,239
stands uh that supports that stands

1587
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:08,560
behind the um the next the The Brown

1588
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:11,520
principle that we're going to do in a

1589
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:13,639
second of course you can do exactly the

1590
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:16,639
same that I've done here

1591
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:20,600
for uh positive semide definite you can

1592
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,600
also do it for negative

1593
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,040
sem okay

1594
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:48,880
these

1595
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:57,719
steps help understanding uh

1596
01:29:55,199 --> 01:30:00,719
the various steps on the previous

1597
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:00,719
uh

1598
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:10,480
slide and

1599
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:15,760
uh the bottom line is is here you can uh

1600
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:15,760
um rewrite that aou

1601
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:24,679
X it it this is equal to the

1602
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:31,480
partial of ax which is the conjugate

1603
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:31,480
potential to variable uh uh X so

1604
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:37,400
um yeah so suppose suppose our function

1605
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,800
is

1606
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,800
S and

1607
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:50,239
S is a function of energy and so s e e

1608
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:53,600
which is the equivalent so our functions

1609
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:54,920
is the entropy and X variable is the

1610
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:59,400
energy

1611
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:02,560
so s e e means partial of s with respect

1612
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:04,800
to e twice but since the partial of s

1613
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:10,000
with respect to

1614
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:10,000
e is 1 / t

1615
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:16,440
Okay so this is equivalent also to the

1616
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:22,280
the you can write it

1617
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:26,600
as s comma e which is the inverse of the

1618
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,600
temperature the gain comma

1619
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:35,600
e and of course you can do also the

1620
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:39,400
other uh like that so this is the

1621
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:44,400
meaning of partial of the a comma X

1622
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:44,400
again comma X done at constant

1623
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:52,960
y the point is

1624
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:54,639
that uh by doing this math here that I

1625
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:59,880
want to skip

1626
01:31:54,639 --> 01:32:04,119
uh I have uh um I prove that the Lambda

1627
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:09,239
also the lambdas can be written as

1628
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:11,960
partials of um this potential so on the

1629
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:15,280
first derivative respect to X but not

1630
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:18,639
while keeping y constant y but but while

1631
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:22,000
keeping constant the other

1632
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:24,560
potential conjugated to

1633
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,679
Y okay

1634
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:30,400
so what changes in these two terms is

1635
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:33,239
what is kept constant here I keep

1636
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:36,600
constant y here I say I keep I keep

1637
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:40,040
constant the potential conjugated to

1638
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:44,159
Y and that's the

1639
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:44,159
key to

1640
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:54,400
uh to the the Practical uh consequences

1641
01:32:52,119 --> 01:32:57,199
of these mathematics

1642
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:00,040
so for

1643
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:03,040
example let's change once more variable

1644
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:05,520
so that we you get uh a more confused

1645
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:09,880
but we just have five minutes so it's

1646
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:13,520
okay uh so we start from a function

1647
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:15,880
E from this fundamental relation this

1648
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:19,280
form of the fundamental

1649
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:21,679
relation keep the end fixed and look at

1650
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:24,679
what happens by applying what we've just

1651
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,679
seen

1652
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:34,639
this is the train of inequalities that

1653
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:40,400
is implied by one of the forms by this

1654
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:43,239
form and by the second form is written

1655
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:45,880
here you can do the

1656
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:50,000
substitutions uh you see I put here what

1657
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:51,440
the variable X Y is what a subx a sub y

1658
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,719
called the temperature and the pressure

1659
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,719
in our case and here is a

1660
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:02,480
result now by the way by looking at

1661
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:05,440
these derivatives you find all friends

1662
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:07,119
and you can see that for example you can

1663
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:11,000
rewrite this as

1664
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:15,440
CP is greater than or equal to CV which

1665
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:18,199
is greater than equal to zero or that

1666
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:19,320
one the compressibility constant

1667
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:22,040
temperature is greater than a

1668
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:25,400
compressibility at constant

1669
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:27,199
entropy okay

1670
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:31,480
so what's the

1671
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:31,480
reading that the chatel brown

1672
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:36,840
does so what's the difference here

1673
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,639
between V the what is what is the

1674
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:42,119
difference between these two derivatives

1675
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:44,800
is what is kept

1676
01:34:42,119 --> 01:34:48,280
constant I change the entropy and

1677
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:52,719
measure what temperature change

1678
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:55,639
occurs uh when I keep volume or when I

1679
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,639
keep uh pressure

1680
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:03,520
fixed you see

1681
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:09,159
volume

1682
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:12,719
is the original variable pressure is the

1683
01:35:09,159 --> 01:35:16,679
conjugated potential it has to do with

1684
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:18,520
the tendency to escape uh to to to gain

1685
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:21,199
volume so minus pressure is the tendency

1686
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,199
to yield

1687
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:27,199
volume so the the idea is that you know

1688
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:30,600
that the interpretation of these

1689
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:34,320
derivatives being positive is that the

1690
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:36,040
system uh reacts if you move it away

1691
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,000
from the mutual equilibrium state from

1692
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,600
of the

1693
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:44,159
environment uh you add some entropy for

1694
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:45,639
example it will increase its temperature

1695
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:51,480
this is

1696
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:54,040
positive so as to increase its uh

1697
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:58,320
uh tendency

1698
01:35:54,040 --> 01:36:01,159
to return energy to contrast your change

1699
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:03,639
by giving energy giving energy away to

1700
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:06,280
your environment so the system responds

1701
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:08,280
by trying to uh spontaneously

1702
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:13,040
reestablish

1703
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:16,520
equilibrium but it does more

1704
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:19,320
so if you do it at constant volume than

1705
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:22,320
if you do it at constant pressure so the

1706
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:24,760
reaction of the system is

1707
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:27,320
stronger uh

1708
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:29,119
if if what so what's the difference the

1709
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:33,040
difference is that

1710
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:34,920
here the system as as a smaller reaction

1711
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:37,840
if you

1712
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:40,400
keep keeping the pressure constant means

1713
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:43,679
means keeping your

1714
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:46,520
system uh in equilibrium with your res

1715
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:49,360
at least as for the condition that

1716
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:51,080
requires pressure equality so you're not

1717
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,560
touching that condition for Mutual

1718
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:55,080
equilibrium you're touching also some

1719
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:57,400
something else so if you if you do it

1720
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:59,920
there the system says all right well

1721
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:03,000
after all you're you're moving me away

1722
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:06,360
but not so much so its reaction is

1723
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,560
softer if you move it away so that also

1724
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:11,400
its pressure changes and therefore like

1725
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:15,400
you do when you keep the volume constant

1726
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:17,920
uh then it will U it will uh in in

1727
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:20,840
increase uh not

1728
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,760
only so essentially you are

1729
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:25,320
touching two conditions of Mutual

1730
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,000
equilibrium touching equality of

1731
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:30,840
temperature and touching equality of

1732
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:36,560
pressure and therefore the system reacts

1733
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:36,560
stronger wants more to come back to

1734
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:47,000
equilibrium this is the uh this is the

1735
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:50,760
um uh the idea and since I wanted

1736
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,960
to to give me two more minutes I wanted

1737
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:55,360
to uh show you the uh

1738
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:59,000
application

1739
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:02,080
here you know uh this is an air spring

1740
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,400
so it's like a piston with air

1741
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:07,960
inside and it acts like a standard uh

1742
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:10,440
mechanical spring you can compute the

1743
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:12,960
spring

1744
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:16,560
constant and you here are the details

1745
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:18,760
it's kind of easy um mechanical

1746
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:24,800
engineering so to

1747
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:27,920
speak uh so the cake this uh K is the K

1748
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:33,119
the the spring constant that

1749
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:37,960
relates the increasing uh reaction or

1750
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:40,960
force of your spring to a change in its

1751
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,960
uh

1752
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,560
compression and this is also similar

1753
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,639
situation it this acts as a

1754
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:53,800
spring and you can

1755
01:38:49,639 --> 01:38:57,320
compute uh DF over DX

1756
01:38:53,800 --> 01:39:00,840
and uh if you do go down here you see

1757
01:38:57,320 --> 01:39:03,080
it's related to how much the area little

1758
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:06,040
a of the Piston the

1759
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:08,320
volume and this thing as a denominator

1760
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:08,320
is the

1761
01:39:09,639 --> 01:39:15,679
compressibility so you could have U so

1762
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:18,480
if you act your

1763
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:22,040
spring while keeping the temperature

1764
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:25,040
constant so if your spring uh is in

1765
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:27,440
contact with the th

1766
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:30,159
were and therefore it has the time to

1767
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:33,880
exchange energy to remain in mutual

1768
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:36,679
equilibrium which typically is when you

1769
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:40,280
push it but push it slow enough so that

1770
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:42,599
the system has time to uh exchange heat

1771
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:48,280
with the environment and remain in

1772
01:39:42,599 --> 01:39:52,040
equilibrium then you get one spring

1773
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:57,560
constant If instead you push a spring

1774
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:59,840
fast like when the car goes on on a on a

1775
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:03,960
bump

1776
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:06,639
uh that the system doesn't have time to

1777
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,880
exchange energy or or heat and the

1778
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:11,119
entropy remains

1779
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,360
constant so that's the

1780
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:16,000
isothermal uh compress I'm sorry the

1781
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:18,480
isentropic compressibility that

1782
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,320
appears and so you see that the ratio of

1783
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:24,320
these two compress of these two uh spray

1784
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,320
constants

1785
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:33,159
is

1786
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:35,679
equal to CP over C CV which for air is

1787
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:39,560
1.4 we just

1788
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:42,560
reviewed so that means that U if you act

1789
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:46,040
on the spring fast you get the spring

1790
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:47,639
constant that is 40% higher than if you

1791
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:49,159
act on the spring

1792
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:52,520
slow

1793
01:40:49,159 --> 01:40:55,280
okay and these devices if you look up

1794
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:58,360
air Springs you see that there are uh

1795
01:40:55,280 --> 01:41:04,840
it's an enormous business because as I

1796
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:07,760
said trains uh buses bicycles cars use

1797
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:13,000
spring constants combined also with The

1798
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:16,320
Dumping system to give you uh like um

1799
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:20,280
suspension systems that are uh allowed

1800
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:21,840
to absorb vibrations and make it uh more

1801
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:24,320
uh

1802
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:29,400
comfortable Okay so sorry if I went a

1803
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:29,400
little bit uh late
