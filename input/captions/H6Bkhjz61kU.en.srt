1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,720
- Welcome everybody to
the Gardner Lecture.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,340
It's a obviously virtual lecture

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,183
and a genuine welcome to all.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,230
Its the 61st anniversary of
the Lester D. Gardner Lecture,

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,340
which was first delivered in 1969.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,340
And of course, it's the first
an inaugural virtual lecture,

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,253
which shows we're living
in extraordinary times.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Certainly, Grover learning,
who was the first guy,

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,360
in the lecture would never
fathom doing this virtually.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,220
But he was after all an
aeronautical engineer.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,530
We know the visionary.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,393
So we're getting some
interference in the background.

13
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:45,410
I don't know where that's coming from.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,243
But before we get started,

15
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:49,130
there's a few housekeeping items

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,120
that I want to let you know.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,200
First thing is,

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,210
we're recording this meeting

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,840
and we'll follow you via email

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,743
to share a link of this recording.

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,317
And we just gonna in just a
moment begin the presentation

22
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:07,350
and we encourage you to ask
questions in the presentation.

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,967
And you can do it by putting
up your hand, your virtual hand

24
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,800
you know, I'll see that

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,950
or during the designated Q&A session

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,930
at the end of the presentation.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,110
So those are both a Q&A thing on your Zoom

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,810
and you can also put up your hand.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
So you all in View-only mode.

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,050
So as I said, raise your
hand, your blue hand,

31
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,330
not your virtual hand,

32
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,097
because I can't see your actual hand

33
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:36,923
and we'll call on you and
unmute your microphone.

34
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,910
We will make a submitted questions,

35
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,490
live to all attendees as
we read and answer them.

36
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,670
If we get to the end of the time,

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,330
your question hasn't been
answered please submit them,

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,330
we'll do our best to follow up
with you in the coming weeks,

39
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,130
so with an answer.

40
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,030
So let me also thank
Sarah Cody, Joyce Light

41
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,400
and Kathy Manal have helped set this up.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,223
This literally would not
be possible without them.

43
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,570
Now in addition to,

44
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,680
making history with
today's Gardner lecture,

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,950
we're also marking history.

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,900
The Gardner lecture was made possible,

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,470
by the request of the late
Major Lester D. Gardner,

48
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,410
a member of the MIT Class of 1898

49
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,690
to sponsor annual presentations,

50
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,610
on aeronautical history.

51
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,380
Over the years we've been
honored by luminaries such as,

52
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,470
Igor Sikorsky, Jimmy Doolittle,

53
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,113
Yvonne Brill, Neil Armstrong,
to name just a few.

54
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,180
A remarkable individual
Major Gardner played not one,

55
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,040
but two critical roles in
the advancement of aviation,

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
in the early is the 20th century.

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,860
First with encouraging
of Grosvenor learning,

58
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,350
Jerome Hunsaker, Glenn
Martin, Major Gardner,

59
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,150
organized the Gardner
the publishing company,

60
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,700
which published, aviation who's
who in America aeronautics

61
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,290
and rubber age

62
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,070
and later aviation and
aeronautical engineering,

63
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,350
which became the predecessor
of Aviation Week.

64
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,780
A magazine that many
of us read every week.

65
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,300
In addition, Major Gardner
was among the founders

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,930
of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences,

67
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,890
later the Institute of
Aeronautical Sciences,

68
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,160
one of the progenitors of the,

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,610
American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics,

70
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,040
which of course,

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
is the professional
society that's associated,

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
with aerospace engineer.

73
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,360
Anref is an air officer World War One

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,640
and he was the recipient of
numerous aeronautical awards,

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,880
including the Guggenheim medal in 1947.

76
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,800
Given for Outstanding Achievement
in advancing aeronautics,

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,250
particularly for his
conception of organization,

78
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,540
is true for aeronautical science.

79
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,260
Major Gardner's interest in MIT,

80
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,050
especially as aeronautical programs,

81
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,750
continued throughout his life

82
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,880
and is alive today,

83
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,560
not only in the Gardner lectureship,

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,440
but also Hunsaker professorship,

85
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,890
which he helped to establish.

86
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,350
So without his background,

87
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,160
I ask you to turn your
attention to the present

88
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,280
and the remarkable individual,

89
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,840
delivering today Gardner lecture,

90
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,765
Retired Marine Corps Major General,

91
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:05,200
Charles Frank Bolden Jr.

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,850
The vast majority of you,

93
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,600
will recognize General Bolden as the,

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,550
12th NASA Administrator,

95
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,290
serving from July 2009 to January 2017.

96
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,090
Prior to his nomination for the post,

97
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,020
by President Barack Obama,

98
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,880
General Bolden enjoyed a 34
year career in the Marine Corps,

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,100
including 14 years as a member
of NASA's astronaut office.

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,150
After joining the office in 1980,

101
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,950
he traveled into orbit four times,

102
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,840
aboard the Space Shuttle,

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,270
between 86 and 94,

104
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,550
commanding two of the missions,

105
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,410
piloting two others.

106
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,860
Today he's the CEO

107
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,520
of the Charles and Bolden Group LLC,

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,180
an Independent Director of
Atlas Worldwide Holdings

109
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,560
and Blue Cross Blue
shield of South Carolina.

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,670
And fortunately for us,

111
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,020
a member of the MIT department

112
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,030
of Aeronautics and Astronautics
visiting committee,

113
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,710
rather than detail his
accomplishments, which would be,

114
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,810
a long and impossible task,

115
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,873
let me just say,

116
00:04:57,873 --> 00:05:00,710
he's an extraordinary
individual, extra ordinary times.

117
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,400
I've known Charlie for many years

118
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,510
and it's been a, good friendship.

119
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,640
For that I invite General Bolden

120
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,630
to approach the Dias virtually,

121
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,293
share his observations on,

122
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:13,347
the history of MIT's aeronautics

123
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,660
and Human Spaceflight Programs.

124
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,630
Speaking on leading through
unprecedented times.

125
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,850
General Bolden.

126
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,187
- Dan, thank you so very much.

127
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,900
And for everybody who's
tuned in or dialed in,

128
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,060
or called in or whatever we call it.

129
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,580
Thank you very much for coming in also.

130
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,987
I wanna echo what Dan said
about some individuals.

131
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:35,640
I really wanna thank Sarah
Joyce, Kathy and Anthony,

132
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,550
our technical assistant,

133
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,140
none of without whom,

134
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,360
we wouldn't be here today.

135
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,710
So thanks to all of you.

136
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,500
Dan's already mentioned that I served as,

137
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,070
the 12th NASA Administrator,

138
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,010
so I was the NASA Administrator,

139
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,820
throughout President Obama's two terms.

140
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,060
And during that time,

141
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,920
I was actually privileged
to be on hand for,

142
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,260
some major changes in both
the strategic plan for the,

143
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,720
Aeronautics Research
Mission Directorate which,

144
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,200
is of special interest to people at MIT.

145
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,540
But also, I was there for a
major change in the method,

146
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,780
of conducting human spaceflight,

147
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,990
for the nation's civil space society.

148
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,990
So, my hope is that, Lester D. Gardner,

149
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,013
for whom the lecture series is named,

150
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,420
you know, he could have no way,

151
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,890
anticipated what we're doing today.

152
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,620
I mean, It would have boggled his mind

153
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,330
if he had even thought about it.

154
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,480
And, but it is my hope,

155
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,300
because this is the inaugural
virtual Gardner lecture,

156
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,883
that my presentation will
not cause its namesake,

157
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,560
to roll over in his grave.

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,700
So with that in mind,

159
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,940
let me go and I'm gonna talk about,

160
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm gonna try to touch very briefly,

161
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,710
on the evolution of aviation,

162
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,150
from the Wright brothers,

163
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,430
first flight it Kill Devil Hills,

164
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,020
South of Kitty Hawk,

165
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,110
North Carolina on the
17th of December in 1903.

166
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,740
Through the establishment of the NAC

167
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,370
or the NASA Advisory
Committee on Aeronautics

168
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,520
and then on to subsequent
aircraft development in, you know,

169
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,460
involving jet engine, supersonic
flight and everything.

170
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,890
What after the NACA was created in 1915

171
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,530
and then kind of flow
into human spaceflight,

172
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,420
which came with the
establishment of NASA in 1958,

173
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,950
by the National Space Act.

174
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,920
Now, I know that's a mouthful,

175
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,340
and most of you say there
is no way in the world,

176
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,440
we're gonna do this.

177
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,110
So we'll try to see if we can do it.

178
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,530
So if I can get the first slide Sarah.

179
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,053
This is what Gardner started
and this is the Wright flyer.

180
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,110
You know, this thing, most of us,

181
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,920
walk from our bedroom
to our door and we go,

182
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,333
as far as the Wright flyer flew,

183
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,710
on those early flights in 1903.

184
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,530
But it was the beginning
of powered flight,

185
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,890
as we know it

186
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,330
and everything started there.

187
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,080
And so it's, that's our heritage.

188
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,350
A lot of what I'm gonna say,

189
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm not gonna mention MIT by name.

190
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,530
But if you go through the
history of Aeronautics and Space,

191
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,330
there is a name of an institution

192
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,040
that comes up almost every time

193
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,790
and every page and it is MIT.

194
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,965
So it goes without saying

195
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,560
that what we're talking about today,

196
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,490
is also about that the legacy of MIT

197
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,210
and its work in aeronautics
and astronautics.

198
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,210
As I mentioned, the the old
NAC was established in 1915.

199
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,110
And interestingly, it was
snuck in, if you will,

200
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,297
under as a part of the Naval
Appropriations Act of 1915.

201
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:46,010
And it was put in by
assistant then Assistant

202
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,470
Secretary of the Navy
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

203
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,163
and it came about,

204
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,940
sort of in the midst of
World War one because,

205
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,320
after the Wright brothers
were unable to get anybody,

206
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,330
in the US interested in, buying airplanes

207
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,170
or picking up airplanes,

208
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,170
the Europeans ran away with it.

209
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,350
And so NACA was established,

210
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,800
in an effort for the U.S
government to catch up with,

211
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,890
Europe's rapid technological
advancements in aviation.

212
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,023
And then, as it progressed
during World War two,

213
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,250
NACA was described by some
people is the force behind,

214
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,410
our air supremacy

215
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,130
and it was primarily
due to its ability to,

216
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,890
adapt to geopolitical and
military challenges coming

217
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,400
from the Germans and the Japanese.

218
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,610
We have established in

219
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,370
and I'll give you their present day names,

220
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,280
the four centers of excellence

221
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,590
if you will have the
four places of operation

222
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,310
for the only NACA were Langley,

223
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,210
what is now Langley Research Center.

224
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,043
What is now,

225
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:45,450
Ames Research Center out in
Mountain View California.

226
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,390
What is now,

227
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,940
what used to be Dryden
Flight Research Center

228
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,230
and is now the Armstrong Research Center.

229
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,063
And then Louis,

230
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,840
that is now the Glenn Research Center,

231
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,183
in Cleveland Ohio.

232
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,210
When more of a right was put on,

233
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,130
the NACA in 1920 by President Wilson,

234
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,140
they decided to take on a
new and ambitious mission

235
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,270
and that was to promote,

236
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,580
military and civilian aviation,

237
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,720
through applied research

238
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,070
that looked beyond their current needs.

239
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,640
So, they started out with 100 employees,

240
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,740
by 1938 they had 426.

241
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,330
And the big thing that they did,

242
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,210
which I love

243
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,223
and we tried to do it NASA,

244
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,410
just before I left my
tenure as the administrator,

245
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,360
was we actually authorized
Bootleg research.

246
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,380
So it was,

247
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,630
research in areas that
people may not have,

248
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,799
been thinking were of importance,

249
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,440
and it was through the Bootleg research

250
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,600
that we got a string of
fundamental breakthroughs like,

251
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,660
thin airfoil theory in the 20's

252
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:50,507
NACA engine cows in the 30's,

253
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:53,600
the NACA a airfoil series in the 40's

254
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,010
and the area rule for supersonic aircraft,

255
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,060
in the 1950's.

256
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,133
So next slide.

257
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,430
This aircraft aircraft on the left,

258
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,720
I think most of you recognize it.

259
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,390
I don't think it's hanging
in the Smithsonian right now,

260
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,830
doing its renovation,

261
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,790
but it will return there
but it's the bill x one.

262
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,630
That was the aircraft in which,

263
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,320
Chuck Yeager broke the speed of sound,

264
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,970
exceeded the sound barrier,

265
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,390
the very first time.

266
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,390
And then down on the
bottom right is the x 15.

267
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,390
This shows us the transition
between the NACA and NASA

268
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,540
because the X 15 actually was among,

269
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,360
NASA's first airplanes and aeronautics.

270
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,453
You know, NASA came into being in in 1958,

271
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,780
when the Congress became alarmed,

272
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,120
by the perceived threat
to national security

273
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,040
and technological leadership,

274
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,860
something that became known
as the Sputnik crisis.

275
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,580
And they urged immediate and swift action

276
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,230
and President Eisenhower

277
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,240
and his advisors,

278
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,750
wanted even more,

279
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,860
I guess deliberate measures so,

280
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,013
January 12 1958,

281
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:08,090
NACA organized a special
committee on space technology

282
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,650
that was headed by Guy Skifard

283
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,140
and that brought us,

284
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,940
what was later called the,

285
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,150
NASA research program for space technology

286
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,520
that morphed into NASA under
the National Space Act.

287
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,440
So Sputnik, go to the next
one, if you will, Sarah,

288
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,050
I take that back.

289
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,223
This was one of NASA's first

290
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:33,150
or among NASA's leading
airplanes research,

291
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,780
it's the X 29.

292
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,230
It became the first
forward swept airplane to,

293
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,460
actually fly to exceed
Mach one and level flight.

294
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,080
And a lot of our work with the X 29,

295
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,480
brought about an understanding of,

296
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
composite materials in aircraft,
forward swept wing and in,

297
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,960
super critical air foils and

298
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,320
a lot of other things.

299
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,893
So, the next one if you will.

300
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,070
Now we get into some of the
other research that NASA,

301
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,810
began to do which was,

302
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,010
when I talked about stuff
that was out of the box,

303
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,260
they began to kind of
experiment with DARPA

304
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,930
and with Bell Helicopter on,

305
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,840
rotary wing with what we
call two rotor technology.

306
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,180
And that brought us the
XPS 15 up in the top left,

307
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,450
which was sort of the Father,
if you will of the MV-22,

308
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,350
the venerable Osprey which now is a staple

309
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,360
of marine aviation

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,010
and about to become the Navy's
carrier onboard delivery

311
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,100
or cod aircraft

312
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,170
and down in the bottom right,

313
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,280
the AgustaWestland 609,

314
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,070
which is one of a number
of different commercial,

315
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,150
tiltrotor aircraft.

316
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,220
So this kinda hows you
how NASA in keeping with,

317
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,150
the legacy of NACA,

318
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,500
while turning to thoughts of spaceflight,

319
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,400
did continue their work and aeronautics,

320
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,510
in tiltrotor Aircraft.

321
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,423
Next one Sarah.

322
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,700
Here will take you through a series of,

323
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,350
conceptual drawings of explains

324
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,093
that came about with NASA's 2014 change,

325
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,280
in the strategic plan for the

326
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,730
Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate.

327
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,537
The ones that I wanna
focus on are the top one

328
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,560
and the bottom one if you will,

329
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,210
because they're actually,

330
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,820
aircraft under construction right now.

331
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,820
The top one is the x-59 queSST,
Quiet Supersonic Transport.

332
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,250
It's a prototype for

333
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,640
that, that NASA is working with,

334
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,040
Lockheed right now.

335
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,567
There's another company called Boom.

336
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:47,930
That's building both a prototype

337
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,060
and planning to build a commercial or a,

338
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,170
I guess a business-type jet,

339
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,100
but all intended to fly
at supersonic speeds,

340
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,691
overland with a low supersonic boom.

341
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,320
And the bottom one Maxwell X-57,

342
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,670
is an all electric airplane sort of,

343
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,550
leading the way,

344
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,070
working with industry to see if we can't,

345
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,910
in trying to take care of the environment,

346
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,537
move to non-petroleum based aircraft

347
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:19,800
or propulsion that's based on electricity.

348
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,820
Something that has kinda
stumped us through the years.

349
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,653
Next one Sarah.

350
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,293
So now, we've talked about
in NACA and we talked about,

351
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,810
you know, this thing on
the horizon called NASA

352
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,210
and I mentioned Sputnik.

353
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,980
Just wanted to show you
this is the culprit.

354
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,340
This was, NASA was on its way to try to,

355
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,847
launch a satellite,

356
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:46,420
we were gonna demonstrate
that we could do that.

357
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,920
And the Soviet Union reared
its head and did what,

358
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,570
became habitual or something
that they frequently did,

359
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,080
in the early days of NASA.

360
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,680
They beat us to the punch,

361
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,370
so they launched Sputnik in 1957.

362
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,120
And it send shock waves around the world,

363
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,540
it really fear,

364
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,130
because we all of a sudden knew

365
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,140
that the Soviet Union had the capability

366
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,840
of putting something in space.

367
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,630
And it threatened America's dominance,

368
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,630
both technologically and strategically.

369
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,660
And so that,

370
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,450
this was the culprit that led
to the foundation of NASA,

371
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,283
if you will.

372
00:16:22,283 --> 00:16:23,116
Next one.

373
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,900
We, you know, NASA thought
about okay, they did that.

374
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,840
So we've gotta speed it up.

375
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,070
And we said,

376
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,340
we're gonna send a human into space

377
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,903
and manned spaceflight program took off.

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,420
Before we could fly our first flight.

379
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,250
However, a young man by
the name of Yuri Gagarin,

380
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,251
a young Soviet Air Force pilot,

381
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:49,890
crawled into the vehicle
that you see in the,

382
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,450
bottom center there, Vostok

383
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,310
and orbited the planet.

384
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,220
And once again,

385
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,990
America's quest to be
first had been thwarted.

386
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,920
And if you look right above it,

387
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,283
you'll see the Soyuz spacecraft which is,

388
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,445
you know, the Russians really believe in,

389
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,810
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

390
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,700
And so Soyuz replaced Vostok

391
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,280
and that has been their
stock in trading for

392
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,400
decades now and it is the
way that we currently,

393
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,350
get to the International Space Station

394
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,850
and we're gonna talk a little bit,

395
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,020
coming up about how we plan to,

396
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,020
get rid of our reliance on the Russians

397
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
for travel to and from space.

398
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,290
On the right I threw it
in just so you would,

399
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,360
have an opportunity to
see what it looks like,

400
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
because you don't hear a lot about it,

401
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,920
but it is a very successful
human-rated spacecraft.

402
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,970
It's called Shinjiro.

403
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,070
And Shinjiro has now
flown about five times,

404
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,710
carrying Chinese cruise to space.

405
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,790
It also has docked with
the Chinese space station,

406
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,940
called Tiangong.

407
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,570
Tiangong one and two, have been flown

408
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,980
and the Chinese,

409
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,380
envision having an
operating space station,

410
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,990
here and in this decade,

411
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,470
a difference between the
Chinese space station,

412
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,950
however at presently

413
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,600
and what we call the
International Space is.

414
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,380
The Chinese generally tend to
wanna operate human tended,

415
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,420
which means the station orbits
Earth and humans come in

416
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,080
and do experiments whenever it's needed.

417
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,990
But they're not there all the time.

418
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,990
So if you can go to the next one, Sarah.

419
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,760
Once we figured that Boeing,

420
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,720
we're behind for sure.

421
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,230
We really put the press on

422
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,763
and the Mercury and Gemini programs,

423
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
struggle to catch up,

424
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,070
we finally launched Alan Shepard

425
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,340
to become the first American into space.

426
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,750
And then John Glenn
became the first American

427
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,300
to orbit the planet

428
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,270
and we gradually moved into
the two person Gemini program,

429
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,220
which was the stepping stone to Apollo,

430
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,500
where we demonstrated,

431
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,140
the ability to do extra
vehicular activity or spacewalks.

432
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,180
Which we knew we would
have to do on Apollo.

433
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,850
And we also demonstrated
the ability to do,

434
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,380
on-orbit rendezvous
with another spacecraft,

435
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,560
which was something that,

436
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,570
we would have to do with Apollo.

437
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,200
If we were really serious about,

438
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,150
going to the moon

439
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,010
and having a lunar module,

440
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,980
separate from the the
orbiting Command Module

441
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,500
and then have the crew come back

442
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,830
and re-run the zoo

443
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,350
and safely return to Earth.

444
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,640
Interestingly, during this period of time,

445
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,150
the world was focused
on the Apollo program

446
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,980
and then once we landed on the moon

447
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,570
people were just mesmerized

448
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,300
and it was a victory for humanity,

449
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,322
not just America.

450
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:41,510
It was humanity had done this.

451
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,850
We, the whole world had done this.

452
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,530
Not known to many people.

453
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,163
However, in the background was,

454
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,080
a very strong effort on the
part of the United States

455
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,084
to figure out, where do we what
do we go next after Apollo?

456
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:02,840
And Many people say that before Apollo 11,

457
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,420
even landed on the moon,

458
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,290
NASA's budget was already
beginning to go down.

459
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,250
And policy decision makers,

460
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,470
were beginning to turn
their eyes away from Apollo

461
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,193
and think about where to go next.

462
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,640
Because I happen to be a Mars guy,

463
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,956
one of the places that we have
almost always wanted to go

464
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,850
from the very earliest of time,

465
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,590
is to send humans to Mars.

466
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,000
So even during the Apollo era,

467
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,030
people were thinking about,
you know, how do we get to Mars

468
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,340
or should we go to Mars?

469
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,323
The Apollo program essentially,

470
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:42,300
came to an end after Apollo 616 and,

471
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,250
we had one more,

472
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,960
one more shot with the Apollo
with the Saturn spacecraft.

473
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,930
When we flew Skylab that
was America's first,

474
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,503
orbiting space station.

475
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,730
But you know, we only had
three flights to Skylab

476
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,670
and then we had a period of dormancy,

477
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,130
while we went to the next step

478
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,223
and that next step,

479
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,150
was actually decided that
it would be something

480
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,870
that would be called the Space Shuttle.

481
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,160
Now when we go back and talk about Mars,

482
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,350
interestingly, the person
who was one of the leading,

483
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,360
proponents for going to Mars was,

484
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,960
Brenda von Braun.

485
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,810
And von Braun had talked,

486
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,500
long early in the Human
Spaceflight Program,

487
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,950
about a vision that he had for,

488
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,970
getting to Mars.

489
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,290
And it was essentially a three,

490
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,660
a three-step program where we would have,

491
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,700
a launch vehicle,

492
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,830
that would provide,

493
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,140
transportation from
Earth to low Earth orbit,

494
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,900
an orbiting station,

495
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,730
where the crew could,

496
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,600
spend some time,

497
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,570
put together the transport
vehicle that would carry them,

498
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,950
on to the moon or on to Mars or wherever.

499
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,160
And then this transfer vehicle.

500
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,130
So, that was the original
vision of what was called,

501
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,560
the space transportation system

502
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,860
that was sold to President Nixon, in the,

503
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,653
early 1970's about 1972.

504
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:08,180
It was a vision as I said

505
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,620
and but it was a vision that
would not be fulfilled because,

506
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,480
President Nixon and his money advisors,

507
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,790
the people in the office
of management budget,

508
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,420
figured the program as
proposed was too expensive.

509
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,880
And NASA was told pick one.

510
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,300
And the obvious pick
was the space shuttle.

511
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,870
And as NASA frequently does,

512
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,010
if we can get our, you know,

513
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,500
we can get our nose under the tent,

514
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,520
will make the rest of it work.

515
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,420
So we embarked on the,

516
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,000
design and building of the space shuttle,

517
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,590
which we finally flew in 1981.

518
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,000
The shuttle was,

519
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,140
I don't think was ever envisioned

520
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,360
to be a program that would
survive for 30 years.

521
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,410
But it nonetheless,

522
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,140
it became the premier program for,

523
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,890
really for the world for a while,

524
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,260
over its 30 year tenure.

525
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,793
So, next one Sarah.

526
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,630
This was the venerable
state space shuttle.

527
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,630
I was privileged to fly on it four times,

528
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,600
twice as a co-pilot or pilot
and twice as mission commander.

529
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,820
And this is actually,

530
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,820
the shuttle discovery on my
second flight into space,

531
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,820
but my first flight on discovery,

532
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,920
as we were in route

533
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,570
for something that we celebrated,

534
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,940
the 30th anniversary of earlier this week,

535
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,690
at the deployment of the
Hubble Space Telescope,

536
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,160
so my second and fourth flights
were flown on this vehicle,

537
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,740
the fourth one being the first,

538
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,003
joint Russian American
space shuttle mission.

539
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,340
We kept, as we flew shuttle,

540
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,840
we started thinking about
where we wanted to go

541
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,383
and we kept coming back
to von Braun's vision.

542
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,916
So if you go to the next one,

543
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:49,410
we kept trying to decide how America,

544
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,351
could fly a space station.

545
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:54,500
And to be quite honest,

546
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,270
my research is inadequate,

547
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,840
because I have had
trouble trying to find out

548
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,840
where we went from a space
station with the U.S,

549
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,960
as its owner operator and
everything the way that,

550
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,310
we had done in our earlier space programs,

551
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,640
then where we decided that,

552
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,100
it was gonna be an international effort.

553
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,973
I have been able to
track down the fact that,

554
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,520
after the fall of the Soviet Union

555
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,713
and the Berlin Wall coming down,

556
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,050
President Clinton decided
that we needed some way

557
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,450
to capture if you will, Soviet scientists,

558
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,350
particularly people in the aeronautics

559
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,970
and space business,

560
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,550
so that they wouldn't go to bed places.

561
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,840
And he gave the order to
NASA to figure out a way to,

562
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,200
get the Soviet get Russia,

563
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,410
integrated into the international
space station program.

564
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,000
The treaty had just
about been sealed with,

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
four members of the consortium,
the U.S, Russia, I'm sorry,

566
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,650
the U.S, China, Japan, the
European Space Agency in Canada.

567
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,150
But they went back in and
opened up the negotiations

568
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,700
and after a number of years

569
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,270
of really hard negotiations
were able to bring Russia in.

570
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,520
And that became the
space station consortium

571
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,880
that we know today.

572
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,710
And as we talked sitting here,

573
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,583
we've now had 20 years plus of,

574
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,690
uninterrupted human presence,

575
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,380
in space, on the
International Space Station.

576
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,140
So that is our, that's
the platform in which we,

577
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,640
spend our time in space
today and right now,

578
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,720
that's our outpost to the world.

579
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,670
So when the Obama admit,
well, actually, if I go back,

580
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,770
beginning in a couple
of the, I'm sorry Sarah,

581
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,410
I didn't mean go back on the slide but,

582
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,230
I said if I go back in time,

583
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,730
actually, prior to the
Obama administration,

584
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,720
going back to the Bush and
Reagan administration's

585
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,900
and you can even go back further
that we kept having these,

586
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,440
visions or space exploration or,

587
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,310
the name kept changing but,

588
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,490
it was always we're going back to the moon

589
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,620
and never going on to
Mars in one way shape,

590
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,020
form or fashion.

591
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,760
But, when the Bush administration,

592
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,600
Bush 43 43 decided that okay,

593
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,490
we really are gonna do this

594
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,940
and that administration began
to put money on the table

595
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,080
to try to get,

596
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,150
commercial companies to,

597
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,410
contract with NASA to provide,

598
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,010
transportation for cargo

599
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,130
and then subsequently for crew to space.

600
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,850
So next one, if you will, Sarah.

601
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,770
So now we're getting into,

602
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,590
what we call Public-Private Partnerships.

603
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,130
And the first two to come in were,

604
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,720
Cygnus, this was originally

605
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,730
designed and built by,
well actually proposed,

606
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,910
by a company called Orbital Sciences,

607
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,060
then became Orbital Metric
and then bought up a big,

608
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,230
aerospace company in Northrop Grumman.

609
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,280
The vehicle itself the cargo module,

610
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,990
is built by the Italians

611
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,270
and it goes to space on a
rocket built by the Ukrainians

612
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,310
that's powered by Russian rocket engines.

613
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,690
The next one,

614
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,850
which is the SpaceX Dragon,
everybody knows that.

615
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,170
So these became our first two,

616
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,100
commercially available
cargo vehicles to carry,

617
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,790
things to space.

618
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,130
Next one I'll show you
is the Russian Soyuz,

619
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:24,033
its main cargo vehicle,
however, is the Russian,

620
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:26,880
the Progress vehicle,

621
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,390
but you can carry small
amounts of cargo inside.

622
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,223
And then finally,

623
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:33,540
an example of another
international partner.

624
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,080
This is the JAXA the Japanese HTV.

625
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,360
We also have a European
cargo vehicle called ATV.

626
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,197
And then finally I'm gonna
show you what is about to come

627
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,370
and this is called the Dream Chaser.

628
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,920
A company called Sierra
Nevada from Colorado,

629
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,440
kinda traveled back to
Langley Research Center

630
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,453
and, saw something on the
shelf called the HL-10,

631
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,640
miniature version of the shuttle and,

632
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,050
they kinda took that, adapted it and now,

633
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,070
it is what we call the Dream Chaser.

634
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,990
The Dream Chaser will first fly
as a cargo vehicle for NASA,

635
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,580
hopefully next year,

636
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,170
but it also has a crew variant

637
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,740
that will be able to carry
up to seven crew members.

638
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,400
And as a pilot,

639
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,020
this happens to be I can now say,

640
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,100
since I'm no longer
the NASA Administrator,

641
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,530
this is one of my favorites because,

642
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,060
I really like, I think we should have,

643
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,010
the nation should have
a capability to go and,

644
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,520
return to space to a runway.

645
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,920
We've been fortunate since
we retired the shuttle.

646
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,790
back in 2011,

647
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,540
that we, you know, we didn't have a need

648
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,490
to make an emergency return
to Earth with a crew member,

649
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,700
but that day will come

650
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,260
and it will be nice to have a vehicle

651
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,980
that can come back to a runway

652
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,270
where we can have an
ambulance waiting right there

653
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,000
to take our crew,

654
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,490
because it doesn't do us any good

655
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,600
to be able to get back to
Earth in about two hours,

656
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,310
after an emergency arises,

657
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,050
only to float around in the
ocean or some other place,

658
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,730
so I'm kind of partial
to a winged vehicle.

659
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,710
But that's my impartiality.

660
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,760
Next one if you will.

661
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,890
And it took a while.

662
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,290
This is, you know, the title
of my talk as you know,

663
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,840
is leading through
unprecedented times and,

664
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,020
so let me talk a little
bit about leadership

665
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,020
and you saw it exhibited back in the,

666
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,060
early days of the NACA when,

667
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,830
Congress and the President realized that,

668
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,080
we had kind of fallen behind,

669
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,410
in the area of aircraft and aviation

670
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,560
and we had allowed the
Europeans to take the lead.

671
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,410
And we found ourselves
embarked in World War two

672
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,300
and we really needed to catch up.

673
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,260
So that was, a I would not
call it an unprecedented time,

674
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,100
It was a challenging task,

675
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,160
but the leadership of the
nation decided to form the,

676
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,143
an organization NACA,

677
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:06,143
which had incredible
advances and achievements,

678
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,393
in getting us back into
the aeronautics game,

679
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,910
again we found that we were challenged

680
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,670
and it call for people to step up,

681
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,700
for American leadership to step up,

682
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,980
when the Russians beat us,

683
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,130
when the Soviets beat us
to the punch with Sputnik.

684
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,250
And we made the decision then
that we were gonna enter the,

685
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,380
realm of human spaceflight.

686
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,510
And we were able to make
some critical decisions,

687
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,480
not the least of which was the decision,

688
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,910
by President Kennedy

689
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,320
that we were gonna send a,

690
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,610
bag then a man to the moon

691
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,080
and bring him safely back to Earth.

692
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,460
I tell people I remember,

693
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,690
one of the people I met when,

694
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,270
I first got down to Houston Texas,

695
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,013
to join the astronaut corps was,

696
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,840
the Gene Kranz who is a
just an iconic figure,

697
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,240
in mission control

698
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,620
and Gene was saying he remembers being at,

699
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,450
Rice University stadium,

700
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,620
on the day that President
Kennedy delivered,

701
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,010
his we're going to the moon address,

702
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,690
and he said he and many of the other,

703
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,510
people from NASA Johnson Space Center,

704
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,570
went home shaking their heads

705
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,270
and presidents lost his mind.

706
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,630
We don't know how to do.

707
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,050
And they woke up, all
woke up the next morning

708
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,410
and said "nope" we misunderstood.

709
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,880
He knows exactly what he's talking about.

710
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,810
He has faith that we
can, in fact, do this.

711
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,643
And so we've got to figure it out,

712
00:31:23,643 --> 00:31:25,400
figure out a way to do it.

713
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,460
So that kind of tells you,

714
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,240
who we are and what we are.

715
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,120
And we're in a time like
that right now today.

716
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,670
The reason we're having this,

717
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,380
virtual webinar for the Gardner lecture,

718
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,010
is because we have something
that is challenging,

719
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,740
not just the nation, but the globe,

720
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,590
but people around the globe
with the Covid-19 pandemic,

721
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,440
but I happen to be one who believes that

722
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,127
if we work together, internationally,

723
00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:54,520
we can tackle this just like
we've tackled everything else.

724
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,700
This is an unprecedented tap

725
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,150
and it will call for
unprecedented leadership.

726
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,410
And I think that is going
to be the leadership

727
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,480
that allows us to come
together internationally,

728
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,880
with multiple nations to solve this thing

729
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,130
that is challenging us right now.

730
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,260
But back to a challenge of the time,

731
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,563
when President Obama came into office,

732
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,360
he decided that we should follow on,

733
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,580
with what Congress had dictated

734
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,770
and what was in the law and that was

735
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,990
that we should retire the space shuttle.

736
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,430
And we should rely on,

737
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,920
the commercial capabilities
of American industry

738
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,800
to get us to and from space,

739
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,840
while NASA devoted its time
and energies to advancing,

740
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,900
spaceflight human exploration,

741
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,980
back to the moon and on beyond.

742
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,680
And so that brought us the three vehicles

743
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,620
that you're looking at here.

744
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,270
On the top left,

745
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,460
is the SpaceX Crew Dragon
and this is actually,

746
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,490
a shot taken by the crew from onboard,

747
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,230
the International Space Station,

748
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,830
last year when The Crew
Dragon made its inaugural,

749
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,960
uncrewed vision or uncrewed journey

750
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,750
to the International Space Station,

751
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,890
went through its paces.

752
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,000
Docked in station stayed there a few days

753
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,810
and un-docked and came back to Earth.

754
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,960
And if all goes well,

755
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,410
which right now we're scheduled to launch,

756
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,830
with the first crew,

757
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:24,663
in the Crew Dragon on the
27th of May next, 27th of May

758
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,770
and I'm keeping my fingers crossed

759
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,420
that, that goes incredibly well.

760
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,420
So, that's the Crew Dragon.

761
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,740
On the right, is the Boeing CST 100.

762
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,800
It had its inaugural flight,

763
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,350
intended to get to the
International Space Station.

764
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,030
However, because of some of the
software issues that it had,

765
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,790
it did not complete its mission.

766
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,760
And now Boeing is saying that
they will fly later this year

767
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,490
that they'll repeat the non crew flight,

768
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,130
so that they can fly crewed mission later

769
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,010
or early in 2021

770
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,590
to give us two commercially
available spacecraft

771
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,450
to get humans into low Earth orbit.

772
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,070
On the bottom.

773
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,160
The much larger vehicle is NASA's Orion,

774
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,660
which is the crew vehicle
that's supposed to take us back

775
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,230
to the moon and then eventually onto Mars.

776
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,743
So next one, if you will,

777
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,090
As I get ready to close
out let me show you just,

778
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,260
a couple of things that
are on the horizon.

779
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,680
On the left is new Shepard
and new Shepard is,

780
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,093
the entry of Blue Origin.

781
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,110
It has now flown a number of flights.

782
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,540
So Blue Origin and SpaceX
are the two commercial space,

783
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,410
companies that have embarked upon

784
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:44,910
and successfully flown
re-usable launch vehicles.

785
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,910
And this is sort of the we
think the wave of the future,

786
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,120
whether or not it turns out to be

787
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,930
as economically feasible
as it seems right now.

788
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,310
remains to be seen.

789
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,020
But as you can tell by the big windows,

790
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,230
the new Shepard was built
for, Sub-orbital spaceflight,

791
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,470
with lots of room for
the tourists if you will,

792
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,090
to get a view of our planet,

793
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,380
from the vantage point of Earth.

794
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,780
I am really, really, really excited about,

795
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,900
the first flight of Blue
Origin with paying customers.

796
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,770
And on the right,

797
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,580
the Virgin Galactic spaceship one,

798
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,200
soon to be followed by spaceship two,

799
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,990
which will, if all goes well,

800
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,487
it's gonna be tight for them,

801
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:28,120
but they could fly their first,

802
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,430
paying customers by the end of this year.

803
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,000
And that would be phenomenal.

804
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,130
Because my belief is

805
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,390
that when we get people who are not,

806
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,075
career astronauts or not
professional astronauts

807
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:42,830
to have an opportunity
to leave the atmosphere

808
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,510
and look back on this planet

809
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,720
and get a view of it from
the vantage point of space.

810
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,510
It'll change their entire
perspective on the planet.

811
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:55,510
And it will give us more and
more ability to convince people

812
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,210
of the importance of
preserving our planet.

813
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,370
Next one.

814
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,430
NASA's present plan with
its international partners

815
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,920
and commercial partners,

816
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,900
is to go back to the moon with humans.

817
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,440
And what they will find when
they get to lunar orbit,

818
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,740
should be the gateway,

819
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,320
the lunar orbit gateway and it's a,

820
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,950
smaller version of a
space station but it's a,

821
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,450
if we go back to Brenda
von Braun's vision of,

822
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,353
the space transportation system.

823
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,350
This is a little bit of,

824
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,370
some of the stuff that
he thought about was,

825
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,830
you would take a transfer
vehicle in this case, it's Orion,

826
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,150
going from Earth to the gateway,

827
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,090
where it will dock,

828
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,960
allow a crew to get on board

829
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,800
and make preparations to
either get into a lunar lander

830
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,740
and go down to the lunar surface

831
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,300
or to get into another transfer
vehicle or back into Orion

832
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,160
and go off to Mars.

833
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,790
There are a few things that we need,

834
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,100
before we're able to make
the final trek to Mars,

835
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,630
but I'm one who believes that,

836
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,270
technologically we have the ability

837
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,530
to get to Mars in the 2030's,

838
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,110
if we can keep our pace and keep up,

839
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,430
with what we're doing right now,

840
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,210
in spite of this incredible challenge,

841
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,480
so, it will require
significant leadership.

842
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,113
But I actually think we can do it.

843
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,840
Next slide.

844
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,903
This one is NASA will
announce this week, I think,

845
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,183
the selection of several of their,

846
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,090
choices for commercial lunar landers.

847
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,980
And this is an example,

848
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,240
of one that was proposed,

849
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,200
by Blue Origin a year ago.

850
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,700
It's called the Blue Moon.

851
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,110
And you can see Jeff Bezos, the founder

852
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,700
and owner of Blue Origin

853
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,320
to give you a feel for the
size of the lander itself,

854
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,160
but Blue Origin and a
number of other companies,

855
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,777
are in competition right now.

856
00:37:46,777 --> 00:37:49,720
And NASA supposed to announce
the winners for this, so,

857
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,053
you may see the blue moon or
another commercial vehicle,

858
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,580
maybe the middle of this
decade or the end of the 20's

859
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,420
that will actually come and
take the first humans back

860
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,760
to the surface of the
moon since the Apollo era.

861
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,520
As we go through this,

862
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,260
I think most of you who follow
the space program know that

863
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,230
there is some push and pull right now,

864
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,180
with the National Space Council and NASA

865
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,510
and industry as to whether or not,

866
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,890
we should take the lunar orbit gateway

867
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,550
out of the critical path

868
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,610
and just focus on getting
humans to the surface

869
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,380
or pick up the lunar orbit gateway later.

870
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,740
That is one of those,

871
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,880
challenges that American leadership,

872
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,620
will have to rise to the occasion,

873
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,400
in these unprecedented times.

874
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,080
And I can't predict what's gonna happen.

875
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,210
I can tell you what I
think I would like to do,

876
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,890
but I'm not a decision maker right now.

877
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,120
And then the final vehicle
I'm gonna show you,

878
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,220
is one that's really way out.

879
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,560
All of the students in the audience today.

880
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,390
Probably will go through and are,

881
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,400
because they're in love with this.

882
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,390
Go ahead Sarah, show us the next one.

883
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,820
This is the Starship

884
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,660
and this is,

885
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Elan musk and SpaceX most recent endeavor.

886
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,680
They finally had a successful,

887
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,840
cryogenic pressure test,

888
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,270
this past week

889
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:17,160
and they're now ready to go
into what they will call,

890
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,170
a hot test where they actually launch

891
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,660
and move over to another landing site

892
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,580
and then come back before
deciding that they're gonna launch

893
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,950
but this is the vehicle
that SpaceX envisions,

894
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,990
putting any number of people in

895
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,390
and sending them off to Mars.

896
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,370
So we're really talking about the future.

897
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,370
Although SpaceX, talks
about being able to do this,

898
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,070
by the mid 20s.

899
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,340
That's a tall order, I'm
not saying it can't be done,

900
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,130
but it will be left up
to the young people,

901
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,930
in our audience today to
really make this thing happen,

902
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,960
because people like me are too far gone.

903
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,650
And then finally,

904
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,363
go ahead to the last slide Sarah.

905
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,080
You know, I mentioned before that,

906
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,110
these are really unprecedented times.

907
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,500
And I show you this slide just to say,

908
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,290
what we can do,

909
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,590
when we are successful,

910
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,223
in bringing together,

911
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,720
international, academic,
commercial entities

912
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,160
to work collaboratively

913
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,490
to take on great challenges.

914
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,380
This was a great day for me
as the NASA Administrator,

915
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,430
because this was a day that I
re-signed an agreement with,

916
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,640
the U.S. Agency for
International Development

917
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,230
and its administrator
at the time Dr. Raj Shah

918
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,717
to seal the partnership between NASA

919
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:38,670
and the U.S. Agency for
International Development

920
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,930
to work together

921
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,230
to try to solve some of
the problems here on Earth

922
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,110
to enable people to get
clean drinking water

923
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,910
or to get food supplies
or to do things like that.

924
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,910
And so, NASA and U.S.A did
have a program called severe.

925
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,120
It's headquartered in
four different places,

926
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,500
around the world today,

927
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,510
but it's things like severe

928
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,100
and like the collaboration between SpaceX

929
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,870
and Boeing and Northrop Grumman and,

930
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,440
Blue Origin that I think,

931
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
are gonna to make it possible for us to,

932
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,070
accomplish some of these
great visions and goals

933
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,700
that we have,

934
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,180
in these unprecedented time.

935
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,750
So, I'm calling on American leadership

936
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,990
to join with others around the world,

937
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,060
because we can,

938
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,500
in fact, tackle the
challenges that are before us.

939
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,840
But it's gonna take
international collaboration

940
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,930
and partnerships among

941
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,100
universities around the world,

942
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,060
as well as commercial entities.

943
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,450
So with that,

944
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,290
I think I'll turn it back
over to you, Dr. Hastings.

945
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,183
And we'll see if we can
answer some questions.

946
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,200
- So thank you very much, Joey.

947
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,380
So for a great talk that
gave us the, you know,

948
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,890
history of both of
Aeronautics and Astronautics.

949
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,390
So we have the first question.

950
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,840
Do you think we are capable
of transitioning between,

951
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,320
administrations, without a major change in

952
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,730
direction of the human space program?

953
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,210
What will it take to maintain momentum,

954
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,490
through the next transition?

955
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,693
- I absolutely think we
can do that, in fact,

956
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,350
I try to say this quietly,

957
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,077
because I don't wanna get
anybody to change their minds.

958
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,050
But, there has been very
little change at all,

959
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,090
between the Obama administration

960
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,760
and the Trump administration

961
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,660
when it comes to human spaceflight.

962
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,580
And the goals there.

963
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,720
If you look at the goal
of getting to Mars,

964
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,090
in the Obama administration,

965
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,960
we always said, we said all along

966
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,740
that the decade of the 20s,

967
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,740
was gonna be the decade
of lunar exploration

968
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,060
and spending time in lunar
orbit because we knew then,

969
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,710
that there were technological things

970
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,140
that we needed to technological challenges

971
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,730
that we needed to solve.

972
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,700
And the moon being only two days away,

973
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,810
what it would enable us to carry out,

974
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,140
experiments and research

975
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,150
that would enable us to get systems,

976
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,260
that can survive the three
year journey to and from Mars.

977
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,950
So we were not,

978
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,500
even in the Obama administration,

979
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,410
there was no plan to go
to Mars before the 2030's.

980
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,110
And then we would move on to the 2030's

981
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,990
to cap off the by then, 60 years

982
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,690
of robotic exploration of Mars.

983
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,040
And you can see what's going on,

984
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,070
we're getting ready to
launch the Mars 2020 rover,

985
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,740
it will have an experiment called Moxie.

986
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,150
That's gonna actually take,

987
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,600
carbon dioxide out of the
Martian atmosphere and

988
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,220
dissociate it into so that
we can get breathable oxygen,

989
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,030
but also, potentially oxygen as a fuel

990
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,180
to get us onto Mars.

991
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,910
So, I think what you're seeing
right now between the Obama

992
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,520
and the Trump administration

993
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,220
and like I say, I say it
quietly because I don't want,

994
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,030
anybody in the Trump
administration to think,

995
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,690
okay, we gotta change.

996
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,540
But there's been no
dramatic change between,

997
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,140
what was being done for the
eight years of the Obama

998
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,270
administration and what's
being done for the first,

999
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,750
three and a half years

1000
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,160
of the Trump administration.

1001
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,603
And I also if I go back to aeronautics,

1002
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,300
they're not putting as
much money as I had hoped,

1003
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,160
they would put into aeronautics.

1004
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,250
But the the X-59 queSST,

1005
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,050
this Quiet Supersonic aircraft,

1006
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,770
the X 57 Maxwell,

1007
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:20,270
they're all electric airplane,

1008
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,110
construction on both of
those proceeds on schedule,

1009
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,480
and we should see them fly here,

1010
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,210
within the next couple of years.

1011
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,600
And so I think even in
the field of Aeronautics,

1012
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,180
we're continuing to move forward

1013
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,530
and it can be done,

1014
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,570
you know, if you have some overlap,

1015
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,410
in the people in the agency,

1016
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,730
where the work actually gets done.

1017
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,820
- Okay thank you.

1018
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,250
So let me just remind the
audience that you can,

1019
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,450
use the raise hand thing,

1020
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,920
not your physical hands

1021
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,980
as I can't see you but the virtual hand

1022
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,560
and we can call on you and
unmute your microphone.

1023
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,150
Alternatively, you can submit
questions by the Q&A button.

1024
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,060
Okay, so here's another question

1025
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,020
from the Q&A.

1026
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,150
How do you propose that we facilitate,

1027
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,900
international collaboration over the space

1028
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,250
sector in today's world
after the Covid-19 crisis?

1029
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,380
What can we do individually,

1030
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,963
as scientists and engineers
to promote this vision?

1031
00:45:18,964 --> 00:45:21,050
- I think what we're finding right now

1032
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,670
and I think the Covid-19
crisis is giving us a,

1033
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,830
perfect opportunity to strengthen
the relationships that,

1034
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,600
we have established.

1035
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,310
You know, NASA today has
more than 800 active,

1036
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:36,410
international agreements
with more than 120 countries.

1037
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,380
And some of those countries
with whom we're involved in,

1038
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,680
in human spaceflight and STEM
education and aeronautics,

1039
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,770
are the same countries

1040
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,580
that are working with us collaboratively,

1041
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,820
working with the National
Institutes of Health,

1042
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,417
working with the CDC

1043
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,370
and trying to find vaccines,

1044
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:57,030
trying to find, you know,
ways that we can combat,

1045
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:02,030
the Covid the anti virus and it's a,

1046
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,010
I think as long as we
can convince ourselves

1047
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,950
that this cannot be done by America alone

1048
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,550
and we continue to collaborate,

1049
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,737
with the international partnerships
out there in the fields

1050
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:13,970
of medicine we'll be okay.

1051
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,160
If you look at what goes on,

1052
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,710
on the International Space Station today.

1053
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,460
It is truly international collaboration.

1054
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,960
A lot of the research,

1055
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,580
is being done in the biomedical area,

1056
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,640
pharmaceuticals development,

1057
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,941
looking at ways to make life
better here on the planet,

1058
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:33,350
growing plants or growing
food for the astronauts,

1059
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,530
but finding techniques that make it easier

1060
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,300
for us to grow things
back here on the planet,

1061
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,590
kind of in keeping with NASA's vision to

1062
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,420
that whatever they do makes life better

1063
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,060
for all humanity back here.

1064
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,030
So I, think what we're
doing with trying to tackle

1065
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,990
the Covid-19 pandemic,

1066
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,430
marries very well with what,

1067
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,700
we have been doing in NASA,

1068
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,730
in the international partnerships
that we've established.

1069
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,020
- All right, thank you another question.

1070
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,560
How do we reconcile the
enormous carbon footprint

1071
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
of space exploration,

1072
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,150
with the need to reduce eliminate
emissions here on Earth.

1073
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,150
- You know, I get asked this
question every once in a while

1074
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,890
and the the biggest carbon
footprint with space exploration,

1075
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,063
is leaving the planet.

1076
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,300
And we all know,

1077
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,270
all of us know that a key to,

1078
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:26,270
to truly efficient and effective
deep space exploration,

1079
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,730
is non chemical propulsion.

1080
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,210
So it's getting away
from what we use today

1081
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,660
and moving on to either
nuclear or electric propulsion.

1082
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,010
We use electric propulsion
quite a bit today,

1083
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,810
with all thrusters in the like,

1084
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:43,580
many of the planetary
exploration vehicles today,

1085
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,940
if you look at the ones
that have been successful,

1086
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,070
there are electric propulsion,

1087
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,510
they use all thrusters.

1088
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,340
We don't need to get somewhere fast,

1089
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,830
but you need to be able to
fly for long periods of time,

1090
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,543
with sustained propulsion,

1091
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,170
you know, back in, I didn't mention it,

1092
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:03,690
but even back in the days
of the Apollo program,

1093
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,700
the Department of Energy was working

1094
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,570
to develop something called Nerva,

1095
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:12,570
which was a nuclear
program to get us to Mars

1096
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,370
that was its purpose.

1097
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,430
So NASA and the Department of Energy,

1098
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,120
were working together on this thing and,

1099
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,480
NASA kinda lost interest

1100
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,320
because they got tied up
with the Apollo program.

1101
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,010
And then where do we go next?

1102
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,650
And eventually, the Department
of Energy just dropped it.

1103
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,483
When I was the NASA administrator.

1104
00:48:28,483 --> 00:48:30,940
I had a lot of old time NASA hands,

1105
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,370
propulsion into a knocking on my door.

1106
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,560
Why don't we bring Nerva back?

1107
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,640
Why don't we bring Nerva back?

1108
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,110
But but the only way we're gonna work,

1109
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,170
on the carbon footprint

1110
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,460
from space exploration,

1111
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,560
is to find alternative

1112
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,560
propulsion types to get us, you know,

1113
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,040
to help us while we leave the planet.

1114
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,070
I have to say, I have to admit,

1115
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,420
I'm not very encouraged by that.

1116
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:57,630
But if you look at companies
like Sierra Nevada, you know,

1117
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,670
although it's not in their launch vehicle,

1118
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,070
because they're talking
about an atlas five

1119
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,441
or a falcon nine,

1120
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,360
but, their propulsion on the Dream Chaser,

1121
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:12,360
is a non, you know, it's a non
petroleum type of propellant.

1122
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,890
And so we need to look
at something like that

1123
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,090
to get us off the plan.

1124
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,970
Methane is better and
Blue Origin is actually,

1125
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,533
they have a methane engine.

1126
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,670
Probably the cleanest thing
we've had that I can remember,

1127
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,770
was the space shuttle.

1128
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,670
No liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen,

1129
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,460
but then you had the
solid rocket boosters.

1130
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,600
So you the game you got
from the three main engines

1131
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,460
and in the lox and liquid
hydrogen liquid oxygen.

1132
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,430
you lost with the solid
rocket booster site.

1133
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,230
I don't have a good
answer to that question.

1134
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,410
- Here's a question from
one of our students,

1135
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,050
Emmanuel Chant.

1136
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,520
How has NASA's direction changed,

1137
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,570
with the appointment of Douglas Barrow,

1138
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,670
as the Associate Administrator
of human exploration

1139
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,040
operations especially in Ariel,

1140
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,070
Lille commercial development?

1141
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,320
- That's a good question
that I can answer,

1142
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,470
because I'm an outsider and looking in,

1143
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,180
but I can give you one example.

1144
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,610
I mentioned the fact that,

1145
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,010
that there was now some discussion about,

1146
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:14,850
whether or not,

1147
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:18,100
the lunar orbit gateway
should be taken out

1148
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,490
of the critical path

1149
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,520
for human return to the
surface of the moon.

1150
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,710
That is where Doug has asked the people,

1151
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:26,390
he has asked his team to take a look

1152
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,190
at look at Gateway and
say, "Hey, is this really,

1153
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,960
is this the way we wanna
spend our money initially?

1154
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,070
Do we wanna invest in an
orbiting a lunar orbiting vehicle

1155
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,980
and maybe delay getting
humans to the surface?

1156
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,730
Or do we wanna focus
on the 2024 timeframe,

1157
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,080
laid out by the president

1158
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,540
and just go Earth direct
to the lunar surface

1159
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,760
and put the lunar orbit gateway
sort of on the back burner?

1160
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,810
I will be honest with you.

1161
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:57,540
I don't know yet what the
full term effect will be,

1162
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,603
but time will tell.

1163
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,070
- All right, here's a question from

1164
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,570
Corey Fronton, who's one of our,

1165
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,210
outstanding graduate students,

1166
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,730
who is in the arrow after Organization.

1167
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,900
Thanks a ton for the talk
Major General Bolden.

1168
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,800
Speaking of unprecedented
leadership in unprecedented times,

1169
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,480
you were the first black NASA director,

1170
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,530
under the first black
president United States.

1171
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,780
Can you talk about a time
you overcame discrimination?

1172
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,230
And perhaps a leadership challenge

1173
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,550
that came to breaking barriers?

1174
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,660
You ever get asked such Charlie?

1175
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,493
Do you have an answer?

1176
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:32,930
- Yeah, you know I'm asked
this question all the time.

1177
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,940
And I think because I'm..

1178
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,176
and Dr. Hastings you know me,

1179
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,390
I am the eternal optimist

1180
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,930
and I don't ever look back.

1181
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,640
And this is maybe bad,

1182
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,910
because it won't allow me to
answer the question completely.

1183
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,680
But I am not one who looks
back at I wish things had been

1184
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,840
or I wish it had been.

1185
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,130
People ask me frequently, you know,

1186
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,590
if there was anything in my
life that I would change,

1187
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,423
to do something.

1188
00:51:56,423 --> 00:51:57,820
I tell them not on your life.

1189
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:00,080
I love where I am

1190
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,730
and I love having my three
beautiful granddaughters.

1191
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,110
And I would not run the risk of,

1192
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,630
changing any of that by going back

1193
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,910
to try to change anything.

1194
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,700
But, you know, I if I think on it,

1195
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,070
I, my mom and dad were school teachers.

1196
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,410
And so they were my role
models and my mentors

1197
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,850
and I tell people all the time,

1198
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,880
everything I learned about
leadership that I needed to know,

1199
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,430
I learned at my dinner table.

1200
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,650
My dad was my high school football coach.

1201
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,060
And he taught me he had a saying,

1202
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,830
it's not the size of the dog in the fight,

1203
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,970
but the size of the fight in the dog.

1204
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:33,120
I was always a little kid
with a Napoleon complex.

1205
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,540
And he told me anything you wanna do,

1206
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,103
you can do if you decide,

1207
00:52:36,103 --> 00:52:37,630
you know that you wanna
study and work hard.

1208
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,950
My mother was my middle school librarian

1209
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,670
and she drove me as my librarian.

1210
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,000
I was a library assistant.

1211
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,720
So I worked for her.

1212
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,230
And my uncle, her brother,
her oldest brother,

1213
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,470
ran the swimming pool where I grew up.

1214
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,730
So we had the Dru Park sharks.

1215
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,190
So everywhere I turned,

1216
00:52:55,190 --> 00:53:00,160
my family was pushing
me to excel and exceed.

1217
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,210
And they didn't give me an
opportunity to stop and think

1218
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,430
that I was black.

1219
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,080
And that there was
something I could not do.

1220
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,420
They said you can do anything.

1221
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,200
Now, of course, getting
into the Naval Academy,

1222
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,260
that's probably the first
time that I actually thought,

1223
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,450
there was something I was
not gonna be able to do,

1224
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,410
because of my race,

1225
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,950
because I couldn't get
an appointment from.

1226
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,690
either Senator Strom Thurmond
or Senator Olin D Johnston,

1227
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,870
who were my, two senators at the time

1228
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,620
or from Albert Watson, my
congressional representative.

1229
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,380
But again, in keeping with
what my mom and dad taught me,

1230
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,610
I wrote to the President
of the United States

1231
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,760
and who was Lyndon Johnson
at the time because,

1232
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,030
I had counted on him,

1233
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,480
giving me a Vice Presidential appointment.

1234
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,330
But President Kennedy was assassinated,

1235
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,230
my senior year in high school

1236
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,580
and my dreams of going
to the Naval Academy,

1237
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,700
kinda went out the window with that, but,

1238
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,660
not to be deterred I wrote a
letter to the president anyway

1239
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,700
and said, "Hey, I know
I'm not eligible for

1240
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,670
presidential appointment this president,

1241
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,567
but you know, I've written
you for several years now

1242
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,880
and you told me to write
your back when I'm a senior".

1243
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,300
I said, this is Charles Bolden.

1244
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,750
I'm a senior and I still
wanna go to the Naval Academy.

1245
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,092
I need help.

1246
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:04,800
I never heard from him.

1247
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,290
But I had a Navy
recruiter come to my house

1248
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,890
and then a federal judge
that President Johnson

1249
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,340
sent around the country
looking for qualified young,

1250
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,720
black men who wanted to go
to the service academies.

1251
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,410
And I ended up getting an appointment

1252
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,700
from Congressman William
Dawson of Chicago, Illinois.

1253
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,340
So my message to kids
the don't waste your time

1254
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,470
and the some of the young ladies,

1255
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,310
in Dr. Newman's class yesterday,

1256
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,560
like everybody in the Dr.
Newman's class yesterday,

1257
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,590
heard me say this

1258
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,930
and I've told Dr. Newman the same thing.

1259
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,700
Don't waste your time,

1260
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,320
trying to explain to somebody,

1261
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,960
why you're in the room

1262
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,070
or trying to justify your being there,

1263
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,210
you are good or you wouldn't be there.

1264
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,197
So just perform just do
what you know how to do.

1265
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,430
And, you know, your performance,

1266
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,920
will eventually win them
over or they're idiots

1267
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,440
and you can't do anything
to change idiots.

1268
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,690
So that's that's what
my mom and dad taught me

1269
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,530
and that's kind of overcome, you know,

1270
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,320
discrimination and stuff.

1271
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,023
- So final question.

1272
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,700
How do you see sustainability
aspect in space?

1273
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,570
Do you think we should
just keep shooting things,

1274
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,090
up in space?

1275
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,530
And shouldn't we also think
about how to clean them up?

1276
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:13,363
- Without a doubt.

1277
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:16,170
And you know, one of the challenges is

1278
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:20,030
that all of us recently
in the space program

1279
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,450
and it didn't start with me,

1280
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,970
but I, you know, several NASA
administrators before me and,

1281
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,410
several administrations before me and now,

1282
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,377
the International Space clock.
- [Voice] Its five o'clock.

1283
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:31,870
everybody realizes that,

1284
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,860
low Earth orbit is,

1285
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,320
really, really, really
getting contaminated.

1286
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,350
It's got way too much orbital debris

1287
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,460
and we've gotta figure out
a way to clean that up.

1288
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,710
We've done some mitigation things like,

1289
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,840
telling anybody who
puts something in space,

1290
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,640
has to have enough propellant to either,

1291
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,612
bring it back for, you know,

1292
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,550
a landing in the ocean somewhere,

1293
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,080
where it doesn't harm anybody

1294
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,510
or take it to a parking orbit,

1295
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,560
when it's useful time and
space has been resolved.

1296
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,760
But there are a number
of small efforts today.

1297
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,030
Unfortunately no nation is
undertaking it as a major effort.

1298
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,720
They're talking about it
in the United Nations.

1299
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,230
But we've gotta figure out
a way to do debris removal

1300
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,010
and not just debris mitigation.

1301
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,330
So challenge that needs,

1302
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:19,230
some sterling leadership
in an unprecedented time.

1303
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,990
- Well, we actually do have some students,

1304
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,200
who are thinking about this,
you know, in the Department.

1305
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,190
- They can do it like this.

1306
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,470
- All right, look, it's five o'clock,

1307
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,614
we gotta bring this to an end.

1308
00:56:27,614 --> 00:56:30,200
We have a ton of questions.

1309
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,690
So we will try to get these
questions actually answered,

1310
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,340
but we just can't do it anymore on that.

1311
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,570
So, thank you all, thank you
very, very much for a great,

1312
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,130
that's the Gardner lecture.

1313
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:48,130
You've given us some both history
and insightful motivation.

1314
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,640
So thank you very much.

1315
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,110
- Thank you for letting
me be a part of it.

1316
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:55,159
It was, I was nervous but it worked.

1317
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:58,890
- All right, okay, thank you.

1318
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,888
I bet we're gonna capture the questions

1319
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:02,680
and then see if we can
get answers out to them.

1320
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,863
Right Sarah and Antony.

1321
00:57:07,836 --> 00:57:09,630
Okay, all right.

1322
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,600
- Thanks very much, you
all be safe and healthy.

1323
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,433
Thanks so much.

1324
00:57:12,433 --> 00:57:13,489
- All right, bye bye.

1325
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:14,322
- Bye bye.
