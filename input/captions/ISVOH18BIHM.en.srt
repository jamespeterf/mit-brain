1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
Okay. So,

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,160
uh first let me look at a curb and

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,480
plate. Talked a little bit about this

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,480
last time at the very end.

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,719
Okay. So, so let's first talk about

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,440
curves in the plane.

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,520
So we have uh

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,760
um we have functions uh f and g

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:50,160
on some interval say from a to b

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:55,719
uh into r and they are uh I'm assuming

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,719
that uh f and g are differentiable

12
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,630
[Applause]

13
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:11,640
and uh and that the derivative

14
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,640
uh are continuous.

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,880
Okay.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,840
And then I'm thinking about uh so I'm

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,960
thinking about the curve. So gamma here

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,960
of s is a curl

19
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:35,560
and it's given by the gamma of s is f of

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,560
s comma g of s

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,200
and I want to look at the length of this

22
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,320
curve right so s here is running in the

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,320
interval from a to b

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,799
and so the length and this is the

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,200
definition of the length But then we

26
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,200
will justify it. So the length

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,280
of gamma

28
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:14,000
um so L is equal to the integral from A

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:18,560
to B of square root of F prime of S

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,120
squared plus G prime of S

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,800
squar

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:29,520
DS. Okay. Now why is this the case? So

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
so why do we why is this a sensible

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,879
definition?

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,959
So suppose that this thing here is f of

36
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:43,599
a comma g of a. So this is the starting

37
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,760
point of the curve

38
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,480
and suppose that the curve looks like

39
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,480
this. So here is here's the end point.

40
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,840
And now imagine that you take the

41
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,319
interval from A to B

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,280
and you partition it into a lot of

43
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,840
small. So so you have this partition of

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,040
this interval

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,159
and then you're looking at so so again

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:18,159
so we have the curve here. This is maybe

47
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:24,159
x i minus one. And here I have x i

48
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:28,560
and under the the map gamma this little

49
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,519
interval here is mapped maybe into this

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,080
piece of the curve.

51
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,760
Right?

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,040
Now this piece of the curve I will then

53
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,519
approximate it by the line segment from

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,239
here to here. Right? So if you do that

55
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,599
then it means that you are looking at so

56
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,120
you have that you're looking at right?

57
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:59,439
So you have that. So here you have x i

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,720
minus one. Here you have x i

59
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,640
and you're looking at the curve on this

60
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,720
little uh uh interval.

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,400
And so

62
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,160
and there the curve goes from so the

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,799
initial point is

64
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,520
is this right? That's the image of that

65
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,520
point. And the image of this is gamma of

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,280
Xi,

67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,440
right?

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,360
And so the line segment from here to

69
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
here,

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,800
right? So this is so the length of this

71
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,400
line segment if you have this point

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,560
here.

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,919
So this is gamma of x i minus one and

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:53,280
this is gamma of x i.

75
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:57,680
Then the length here is the this the

76
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,560
vector here. So gamma of x i minus gamma

77
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,240
of x i -1

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,080
the length of this. But this thing here

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,080
is

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,560
right. This is the end point is this.

81
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,560
Sorry. Yeah.

82
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,320
And the beginning point is this.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
So this here. So it's the length of

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
this.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:42,600
But the length of this by pyagoras

86
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,600
is um is the square of the coordinates

87
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,320
and then taking the square root of that.

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,600
So this is what the length of this of

89
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,600
the line segment here is.

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,560
Right?

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,080
And now, but now like the mean value

92
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,080
theorem tells you that this thing here

93
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,800
is essentially

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,319
the derivative

95
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,199
at some point in between these two,

96
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,639
right? It's it's there's the it actually

97
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:27,360
is equal to if you will uh the

98
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,880
derivative at some intermediate point

99
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,400
um times times the length of that little

100
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
interval

101
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,639
right this is this different here and

102
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,880
likewise so this is

103
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:45,360
u x like this some intermediate point

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,080
and likewise for this there's some

105
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,840
intermediate point

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,000
times the length here.

107
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,720
So this means that this little line

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,400
segment here

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,400
the length of this little line segment

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:12,080
um is equal to and you see that when you

111
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,160
take this thing here and you square it

112
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
then you can factor out. So let me just

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,840
write it out. So you take this thing

114
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,960
here. So it's f prime

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:27,520
like this squared delta xi

116
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,319
squar plus

117
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,319
and then g prime

118
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,280
squar delta x i

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,400
squ. Okay. But now you can factor this

120
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,160
out. So you can write this as square

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,520
root

122
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,039
of uh delta xi

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,919
squared and then frime

124
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:59,280
like this squared

125
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:01,039
plus g prime in this intermediate point

126
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
squared

127
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
right and this factor out both of them.

128
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,759
And so now you can just take when you

129
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,960
take the square root it actually goes

130
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:15,479
out as the this is anyway positive. So

131
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,479
it comes becomes like this.

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,240
And now

133
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,440
the functions g prime and fprime are

134
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,720
both continuous.

135
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,519
So this thing here is like roughly what

136
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,640
it is at one of the end point right. So

137
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:40,800
this here is like roughly equal to

138
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,159
right like this and then it's like one

139
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,760
end point or you can even take like the

140
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,760
Yeah. So it's like an end point.

141
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,200
And so you see that this thing here. Now

142
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,200
when you sum up

143
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,000
when you sum up all of these over this

144
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:10,240
partition and you let the partition the

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,720
the the delta xi goes to zero, then this

146
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:18,080
here is going to converge

147
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:24,080
to the integral from a to b of the uh

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:27,040
square root of frime of s squared plus G

149
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,680
prime of S

150
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,080
squ D S right so so that's why so you

151
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,160
take this little curve

152
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,399
it's parameterized or you take the curve

153
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,880
parameterized by a to b you're looking

154
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:46,399
at this uh at at a partition

155
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,240
and then on each of these little

156
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,440
intervals you approximate the curve by

157
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,760
the by the line segment

158
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
And then you let the as you let this

159
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,760
refinement

160
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:05,519
uh the length of these individual

161
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,640
interval goes to zero then actually this

162
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,600
approximation will have a limit and that

163
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,880
limit is this integral right. So that's

164
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:20,240
why we define it to be the arc length.

165
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,620
Okay. So that's our arc length. And so

166
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,720
let's look at an example of this.

167
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,720
[Applause]

168
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,560
So we look at two examples. Let me first

169
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:40,000
look at case where f of s is equal to s

170
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,480
and uh g of s

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
uh is equal to

172
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,160
uh s squared.

173
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,560
Then I have that. So then the curve is

174
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:59,680
uh so the curve gamma of s is is s comma

175
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:04,480
s 2 and uh frime of s is equal to 1 and

176
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,680
g prime of s is equal to 2 s and so this

177
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,279
means that um and let's say that it's

178
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,720
parameterized s here

179
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,839
from 0 to one. So then the length here

180
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,519
of this curve is the integral from 0 to

181
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,920
1 and then square root and then you have

182
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:30,000
to take this thing here squared. So

183
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:35,920
that's one plus this here 2 s squared

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,600
ds. So this is and is this integral here

185
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,560
1 + 4².

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,720
So that's the arc length. just given us

187
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,160
this integral.

188
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,150
The second example I want to look at um

189
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
about for aren

190
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,839
[Applause]

191
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,079
uh is uh if you you have the unit

192
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,399
circle. So suppose that you have the

193
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,399
unit circle.

194
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,600
So here you have one.

195
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,760
So this is supposed to be the unit

196
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,880
circle. So it's x^2

197
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,600
+ y^2

198
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,720
= 1. It's a unit circle centered at the

199
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,399
origin. Okay.

200
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:30,320
Now this means that um that if you take

201
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:33,120
a point right then um then y here is so

202
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:40,560
this here means that y is given in terms

203
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:43,760
of x with that y^2 is equal to 1 - x^2

204
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,160
and so if you're assuming that you are

205
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:51,519
in this upper where y is positive so if

206
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,440
if uh y here is positive positive then

207
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,480
you're looking at y =<unk>

208
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,800
of 1 - x square.

209
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:07,360
So in this part here where y is positive

210
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,880
you have that you have the curve uh this

211
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,480
part here of the this part here of the

212
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,560
unit circle this one here is given by

213
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,079
the parameization

214
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:28,880
gamma of s equal to uh s and then square

215
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:31,839
root of 1 - s² right and s here is Now

216
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,480
running uh right s is the first

217
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,880
coordinates so it's between minus1 and

218
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,880
one so s here it's between minus one and

219
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
one

220
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,800
okay

221
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:51,760
now suppose that you take some x here

222
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,160
and suppose that you want to look at

223
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,600
what is the arc length of this part of

224
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,959
the circle right

225
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,120
Well then uh in this case if you're

226
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,120
looking at the arc length of this part

227
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,760
of the circle let's call that arc length

228
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:15,279
uh teta theta

229
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:20,639
um so theta here is equal to this part

230
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:26,839
it's now par metricized like this but x

231
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,839
here is so this here is this length

232
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:37,920
of gamma. But now gamma by now s here is

233
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:40,079
running from x to one right because x is

234
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,839
the first coordinate and it's running

235
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,000
from

236
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,760
the first coordinate is running from x

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,240
from this point right this here to to

238
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,240
one right

239
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,000
and so now let's try to calculate this

240
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
length or at least write it up as an

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,440
integral

242
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:07,519
So if we write it up as an integral um

243
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:13,279
we have that so in this case so gamma s

244
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:18,480
is equal to s square<unk> of 1 - s²

245
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,720
and so if we define f of s = s and g of

246
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,399
s=

247
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,440
to square<unk> of 1 - s²

248
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,639
then we take f prime

249
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,760
well that's equal to one

250
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,800
and uh g prime

251
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:42,399
right so there we use the chain rule so

252
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:45,120
this is equal to 1 / 2 square<unk> of 1

253
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,639
- s^2 and then we have to take the

254
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,480
derivative of this also so this is times

255
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,079
-2

256
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,079
uh s like that right

257
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,279
and so this here is of course then equal

258
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,360
to the two cancels and you're getting -

259
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,720
s over<unk>

260
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,120
of 1 - s 2.

261
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,120
Okay.

262
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,279
And so now if you're looking at so f

263
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,800
prime squar + g prime

264
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,360
squared this is equal to f is one. So

265
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,680
this is one plus this thing here

266
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,560
squared. So this is s^ squ and then the

267
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,759
denominator squared is just of course 1

268
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,920
- s squ

269
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,959
and we can now put it on a common uh

270
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,639
with a common denominator right and so

271
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,720
you see that this is 1 - s^ 2

272
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:53,920
1 - s^ 2 that's how you write 1 and then

273
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:58,079
plus s 2 1 - s 2 and so you see that

274
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,519
This whole thing is the s squ cancel in

275
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,799
the denominator and so you're getting 1

276
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,959
over 1 - s^2

277
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,520
right

278
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,760
and so this means that the integral

279
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,910
so this means that the integral

280
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,910
[Applause]

281
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,679
so this length here

282
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,199
um and

283
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,679
the length uh is so actually uh we call

284
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,760
the length theta

285
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,880
and uh it will be clear in a minute why

286
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:40,640
I do this. So the length here is then

287
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:45,600
the integral from x to one right and

288
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,360
then it is uh of the square root right

289
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,480
so it's supposed to be the square root

290
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,799
of this thing here so it's the square

291
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,760
root so if you will is one square root

292
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:02,039
of 1 - s^2

293
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,039
ds Right?

294
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,640
So that's the length, right? But if you

295
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,200
think about it, so you have here the

296
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,640
unit circle again.

297
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,240
What we now calculated was that we take

298
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:22,799
some x here and then we calculated the

299
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:27,919
length of this piece here, right? Well,

300
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:30,400
that piece is um this here is also the

301
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,520
this is how you define this is if you

302
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,520
will this is the angle,

303
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:45,720
right? So theta is the angle, right?

304
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,720
And um and so you see that so theta here

305
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:54,160
is the angle and x here

306
00:18:50,559 --> 00:19:00,640
x here is so and and and this point here

307
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:03,760
sorry this point here is uh is cosine

308
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,720
to the angle comma sign

309
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:12,160
to the angle right that's piece so this

310
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:15,640
means that X is X is actually cosine

311
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,640
to the angle.

312
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,360
Okay.

313
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:30,080
So, so this means that that uh theta

314
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:33,440
here in terms of X

315
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:39,520
uh theta is the inverse function. So

316
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:43,919
it's what's called arc uh co cosine 2x

317
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,640
right. So this arc cosine it means that

318
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,960
it's the inverse function. If you take

319
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,880
the inverse function on both sides of

320
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:57,760
this right then um so if you take the

321
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,640
inverse function so arc cosine

322
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,720
so you get r cosine to x on this side

323
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,440
this side you're getting arc cosine

324
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,880
and then cosine

325
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,760
to theta but these two functions

326
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,160
together gives you the identity so this

327
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,160
is to theta

328
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,160
Okay.

329
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,440
Okay. So, so in other words, in other

330
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:31,200
words, what you have is that arc cosine

331
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,600
to x is given as the integral from x to

332
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,600
1

333
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,400
1 /<unk>

334
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:42,240
of 1 - s^2

335
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,640
ds. So you have this formula here

336
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,000
which is not so so surprising but anyway

337
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,640
you can get it from this and so now you

338
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,880
can get it. So now the fundamental

339
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,919
theorem of calculus. So by the

340
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,919
fundamental theorem of calculus

341
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,120
of calculus

342
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,440
then you have that. So if you have a

343
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,360
function that is given like a integral

344
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,200
like this

345
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,520
then this thing here is the derivative

346
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,840
right the one thing you that's what the

347
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,120
fundamental theorem calculus say except

348
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,840
you got to be a little bit careful

349
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,520
because this is if the variable is up

350
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:36,480
here but now it's down here because it's

351
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:39,760
down here the derivative is minus this

352
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,559
okay let me explain that so you get from

353
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,720
the from the fundamental theorem of

354
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,520
calculus. The derivative of this

355
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,520
function I claim is minus this thing

356
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
here.

357
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,720
Okay. And then this should be evaluated

358
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:03,600
at x. This is the r cosine at x is equal

359
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,919
to like that.

360
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,230
Okay. So now let's just see that. So why

361
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:13,390
is this the case? So you take

362
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,390
[Applause]

363
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,240
So remember that if you have a function

364
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,960
f ofx

365
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,280
and this is given as you're integrating

366
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,360
from some x some a to some x a is fixed

367
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,600
and then you're integrating of a

368
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,559
function like this right

369
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,840
assuming that the function is nice etc.

370
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,400
Do we then we have that the fundamental

371
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,880
theorem of calculus

372
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,159
fundamental theorem of calculus the

373
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,600
derivative of this function

374
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,880
is little f right

375
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,320
but suppose I now switch so now suppose

376
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:03,120
I now look so I don't look at this but I

377
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,360
look at at suppose that g of x

378
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,280
is the integral

379
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,600
from X to A

380
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,280
X to let's call it X to B just because

381
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:20,159
we usually have the end point as the the

382
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,919
the the the last point as B.

383
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,440
So suppose that the function is like

384
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,960
this

385
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,000
what is the derivative right? So but but

386
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,880
this is just the fundamental theorem of

387
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,240
but you know that's one of the rules we

388
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,120
had with writing the integral is we can

389
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,520
write this one here as so here I'm

390
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,159
thinking about that the function little

391
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,159
f is defined on some integral from a to

392
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,159
b

393
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,640
and I can rewrite this thing here in

394
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,679
this form here because I can just think

395
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,520
about this thing here as the integral

396
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,240
from a to b

397
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,080
of f of s

398
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,880
right so sorry let me let me write it

399
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,880
over here so

400
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,279
so I'm just making the trivial

401
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,039
observation that we have that so if we

402
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,279
have a function

403
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,400
from a to b

404
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,039
into r and we have some x that lie

405
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,240
between a and b.

406
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,039
Then we proved that the integral from a

407
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,960
to b of f

408
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:46,760
this thing here is equal to the integral

409
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,760
from a to x

410
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,799
plus the integral from uh x to b.

411
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,840
Right? That was one of the rules that if

412
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,159
you if you take this if you have like a

413
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,559
dividing point in this interval then you

414
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:12,080
could integrate over the first half and

415
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:15,520
then in add integral of the second half.

416
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,880
But this thing here just tells you that

417
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,200
this thing here you can rewrite as this

418
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:27,679
minus that. So you have that the

419
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:32,880
integral from x to b f of s d s is equal

420
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:36,080
to the integral from a to b f of s d s

421
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:44,880
minus the integral from

422
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:48,080
uh from uh a to x f of s ds right and so

423
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,600
a and b are fixed and when you think

424
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,360
about this thing here as a function

425
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,480
function of x then it's equal to this is

426
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,120
just a constant and then minus this. So

427
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,520
when you take the derivative of this,

428
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,240
this is a constant. So this derivative

429
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,480
is zero. The derivative of this, well

430
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,520
that is straight the fundamental thermal

431
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,200
calculus. And because of this sign, you

432
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,600
get minus little f, right? And so that's

433
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,960
what I applied over here that if it is

434
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,240
of this form here

435
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,240
then the derivative of this function is

436
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,240
minus little f.

437
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Okay.

438
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:38,080
Okay. So this was this is so right. So

439
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:42,000
this is how the angle is defined if you

440
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,520
will right. The angle is defined as the

441
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,360
length arc length of the curve, right?

442
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,440
And we can calculate it using this

443
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,840
formula here. And we're getting a nice

444
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,320
uh uh

445
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,600
nice uh I mean we get you know we know

446
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,679
what the this arc cosine we know

447
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,760
actually what the derivative is just

448
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,760
from this arc length and the fundamental

449
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,279
calculus.

450
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Okay.

451
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,880
The next thing I want to talk about is I

452
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,640
want to talk about uh pointwise and

453
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:22,120
uniform convergence of functions.

454
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,120
So you have a sequence of functions.

455
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,880
You have a sequence of functions fn.

456
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,080
So suppose you have you have some

457
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,600
interval I

458
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,600
and you have a sequence of functions

459
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:54,200
fn and you have a function uh another

460
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,200
function f also on this interval.

461
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,399
Then we say so this is the definition.

462
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,600
We say that the sequence here converts

463
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,600
to f pointwise

464
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,799
if for all

465
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,960
x

466
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
fixed.

467
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,240
If you're looking at this, so x here,

468
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,039
think about x as x as being x could be

469
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,440
anything, but it is fixed. And then

470
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,440
you're looking at this sequence here,

471
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,080
right? So this is a sequence of real

472
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,000
numbers because x is fixed. Then you

473
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,039
want this thing here to converge to f of

474
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,279
x. Yeah.

475
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,880
>> Sorry, I had a quick question about the

476
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,360
last thing. So how do you know that the

477
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:55,679
integral of a to bs is zero?

478
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:58,000
So no uh so so

479
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:02,080
um so the thing is that what we're

480
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,200
looking at here so I was asking so

481
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,279
um so this here is uh so if you have a

482
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,840
function capital f that's given like

483
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,559
this the fundamental the calculus gives

484
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,679
you what the derivative is so I'm just

485
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,840
asking suppose that the function that

486
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,960
the variable was not up here but it was

487
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,440
down here what is the derivative and so

488
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,840
in order to figure out that derivative

489
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm just using that so that if I was

490
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,520
integrating over the whole interval a

491
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,399
and b are fixed right so this is just

492
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,960
some number whatever it is it but it's

493
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,399
probably not zero right I mean general

494
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,279
wouldn't be zero but it's just some

495
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:50,320
constant right and so for each x you get

496
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,279
the same constant here and and it's

497
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,279
equal to this plus that. And so, but

498
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,039
this is what we're interested in. So,

499
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm just moving this one over on the

500
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,520
other side. So, I get this thing here.

501
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,279
But remember, this here is a constant.

502
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,480
So, when you take the derivative, it's

503
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,480
zero, right? And so,

504
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,360
>> okay. So,

505
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,360
>> if you were to set a

506
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,200
goes to zero and then you can get like

507
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:28,600
But that's but if uh right so but if you

508
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,600
if if if you if B is equal to A

509
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,399
if B is equal to A uh yeah I mean but

510
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,880
it's not I mean so then this interval is

511
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,279
just a trivial interval right

512
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,399
>> right but doesn't allow you to get

513
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,799
identity there

514
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,000
>> right but but the thing is so the reason

515
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:51,360
why so why did I want to do it yes but

516
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,600
it's like H but but but but it's it's

517
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,159
kind of using something implicitly. You

518
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,799
see what I mean? I'm assuming that X is

519
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,320
between A and B because when we took

520
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,000
this interval, you know, if X is not

521
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,760
between A and B, we had to figure out

522
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,200
what the hell do we mean by this sort of

523
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,200
integral, right? Anyway, and so yes, it

524
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,600
it works even if you re you know if even

525
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,600
if you have the ordering differently but

526
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,559
you just have to all I want to point out

527
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,039
here is that if it is downstairs and not

528
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,320
upstairs you have to you know just

529
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,320
remember the sign.

530
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,320
Okay.

531
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay. So this here so so again so I have

532
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,080
a sequence of functions on the interval

533
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,679
I have another function on the same

534
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,159
interval

535
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,279
and I uh we say that this sequence is

536
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,559
converging pointwise to f

537
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,559
if for all x fixed when we're looking at

538
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,279
this sequence it converts to that right

539
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,799
and so let me look at two examples of

540
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,640
that

541
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,399
Um

542
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:07,399
so the first one

543
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,399
is

544
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,640
so the first example I want to look at

545
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:30,799
this is where the functions fn of x is

546
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:35,080
equal to uh x to the n and uh and x here

547
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,080
is between zero and one.

548
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,360
And so this is my fn

549
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,039
and my f

550
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,600
uh my my function f which is now of

551
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:55,120
course also a function on this interval.

552
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:57,760
This is equal to zero if um x is uh

553
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:03,039
bigger equal to zero but strictly less

554
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:05,360
than one and is one if x is equal to

555
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,039
one.

556
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,919
Okay.

557
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,440
So of course this function f is not

558
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,440
continuous. The other ones are

559
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,440
continuous.

560
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,159
Now

561
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,880
I claim that that this sequence so the

562
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,799
sequence fn

563
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,120
is converging pointwise to f.

564
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,120
So fn

565
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,000
converts to f pointw

566
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:46,880
right because if you take if you fix if

567
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:52,559
you fix x let's say fix x and let's

568
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:56,640
assume uh and uh assume

569
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,840
that that that it's between

570
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,960
sorry it's between

571
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,159
zero it's strictly less than one right

572
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,399
so you're fixing x and let's first deal

573
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,760
with a case where that x is strictly

574
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,720
less than one well if I'm looking at x

575
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,560
to the n so I take some small number by

576
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,839
small just means that it's strictly less

577
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:24,159
than one and I multiply it by itself n

578
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:26,639
time well that certainly goes to zero

579
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,679
right

580
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:35,599
if the if X here is fixed but it's now

581
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:40,839
one then X to the N. If X is one then

582
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,839
this here is still one. Right?

583
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,960
So you see that in this case so this

584
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:51,679
here is f to the n of X and this here is

585
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,760
F of X. So these things here I mean

586
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,839
they're actually equal to this. So in

587
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,119
particular they converge right? And this

588
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:04,720
here is what f of x is. And this here is

589
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,920
again fn of x.

590
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,040
Right? So you have that this sequence of

591
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,079
functions converge to this slightly

592
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,000
crazy function. Um right. Okay. So

593
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,000
that's the first example. They converge

594
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
pointwise.

595
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,480
The next example

596
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,400
I want to look at is

597
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,040
um

598
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,720
so the next example

599
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,640
is where uh the functions

600
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,520
uh are you just summing here

601
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:46,480
you're summing you just take the power

602
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,520
series for for the exponential function.

603
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,839
So you take your summing where k is

604
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:57,000
equal to 1 to n and that's my fn

605
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,000
of x

606
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,960
and then my f of x

607
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,760
is the infinite sum which is the

608
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,680
exponential function and we have already

609
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:16,480
proved that if you fix x right so we fix

610
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:20,880
x then this fn here of x converts to f

611
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,560
of x point you know for each fixed x for

612
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,960
each

613
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,960
fixed x

614
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,520
right

615
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,079
so so this sequence of functions

616
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,839
pointwise converge to the exponential

617
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,440
function

618
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,160
now so this is one notion of convergence

619
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,119
for functions and there's another notion

620
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,000
that is also useful. They're both

621
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,760
useful. Uh the other one is stronger.

622
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,160
And so, of course, if you have the

623
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,599
stronger version, you often get

624
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,119
something much better.

625
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,040
Oh, I shouldn't have erased this, but

626
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:08,920
anyway. So, uh and so the second the

627
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,920
second notion is uh so this is

628
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,839
is is a notion of uniform convergence.

629
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:29,200
uniform is is means that it's that it's

630
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,560
uniform in x. So, so we what we have

631
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,520
here is we have a sequence

632
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,880
of functions and f defined on some

633
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,920
interval into R and then we say that

634
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,920
this sequence here converts to f

635
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,920
uniformly.

636
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,680
If

637
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,160
for all

638
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,800
epsilon greater than zero there exist a

639
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,320
capital n. So that if little n is bigger

640
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,720
than this capital n then f of x minus f

641
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:15,320
n of x

642
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:15,320
is smaller than epsilon for all x.

643
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:24,160
And again right the uniformness is that

644
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:30,599
it holds for all x right

645
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,599
you can use the same capital n for all x

646
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,550
and so now

647
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,510
uh

648
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,510
[Applause]

649
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,599
now what you have is that if a sequence

650
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,760
converge uniformly

651
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,839
then it converge pointwise. So we have

652
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,160
the following lema

653
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,079
that follows directly from the from the

654
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,240
definition.

655
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,240
So lema.

656
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,800
So a uniform convergence

657
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,800
of fn to f

658
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,880
uh implies

659
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,920
point polarwise convergence.

660
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:43,359
of fn of fn to f to to f okay so uniform

661
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,440
convergence imply pointwise convergence

662
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,599
and that's that's clear that's really

663
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,040
just the definition

664
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,440
if I had written out what it means for

665
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,280
so this here I've written out what it

666
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,359
means to have uniform convergence.

667
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,440
If it was pointwise convergence, right?

668
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,280
Then you have these functions again and

669
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,880
you have that this converts to that

670
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,480
pointwise. It means that the sequence fn

671
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:14,560
so so once you fix x then the sequence

672
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:18,839
fn of x right. So once

673
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,839
so once x is fixed

674
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,920
then these here

675
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,079
converge to this.

676
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,320
But saying that this sequence here

677
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,839
converge means that for all epsilon

678
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,320
greater than zero there exist a n

679
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,920
but this n is now allowed to depend on

680
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:44,480
x. So that if little n is bigger than

681
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:46,880
this capital n then f n of x minus f ofx

682
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,720
is smaller than epsilon. Right? So you

683
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,839
see that clearly uniform convergence

684
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,640
implies pointwise and again uniform just

685
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,880
means that this capital n can be chosen

686
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,640
to be the same for all x. Right?

687
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,040
Okay. So now let's look at the examples.

688
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,720
Unfortunately, I raised like the most

689
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,520
important one. Uh so I'll just go

690
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:18,400
through it again. Let me just talk about

691
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:22,560
the example again and then we'll see why

692
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,440
this um this example here does not. So

693
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,640
we had this example from before

694
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,560
where the sequence of functions

695
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:36,319
uh was x to the n

696
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:40,079
and x here was between zero and one

697
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:43,280
and then we had this function f that was

698
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,680
this function that was not continuous

699
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:51,000
but this function was given to be equal

700
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,000
to zero if x here

701
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,800
strictly less one

702
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:03,280
and it was one if x is equal to one

703
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,960
right that was this function f

704
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,760
and we know we already shown that the fn

705
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:15,640
converts to f pointw wise but we want to

706
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,640
see now so that this so I claim

707
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,800
that fn

708
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:26,280
does not converge so This does not

709
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,280
converge uniformly

710
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,319
to F.

711
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,720
We know already that it converge

712
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:39,040
pointwise and I claim that that this

713
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:42,800
sequence does not converge uniformly.

714
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,520
Okay. So now why is this the case?

715
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,760
Well, this is because

716
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,520
you see by the intermediate value

717
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,520
theorem

718
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,319
the functions

719
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,760
Fn are continuous

720
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:01,359
at zero they take the value of zero at

721
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:06,839
one they take the value one so for each

722
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,839
n by the intermediate value theorem

723
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,160
um uh for each

724
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,560
since

725
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,560
since each

726
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,160
uh fn

727
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,160
is continuous

728
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,599
then there exist

729
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:44,160
there exist a x n but it really will

730
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:51,520
depend on n

731
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:55,440
so that f n of xn n will take the value

732
00:43:51,520 --> 00:44:00,240
1/2 right so the functions here this is

733
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:04,079
the functions oops this is the functions

734
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,160
this is the function fn

735
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,720
it takes at zero it takes a value of

736
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:14,079
zero at one it takes a value one so

737
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,359
there is somewhere where where

738
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,119
a half is achieved and this is at this

739
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,920
exit

740
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,520
Right?

741
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:29,040
So you have that and again this xn is

742
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:33,119
depending on n and the thing is that as

743
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,880
n get large this point will have to move

744
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:40,880
very close to one. Okay. But if you're

745
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:46,319
now looking at f(n)

746
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:49,319
uh of x minus f ofx

747
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,319
right

748
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,560
so we want to we if it was converging

749
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,960
uniformly it would mean that this

750
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,240
difference here would be smaller than

751
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:07,079
some epsilon for all x right but if

752
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,079
you're just looking at this point Here

753
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,079
this difference here is this point here

754
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,040
xn

755
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:22,640
will lie strictly xn here will lie this

756
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:26,400
is where this value here is a half it's

757
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:30,960
not one so it's lie be strictly between

758
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:34,400
zero and one right so you see that for

759
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,200
each n this function

760
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:42,160
f at xn this will always be zero. This

761
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,480
is because the function f is zero except

762
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,920
at one and this point is definitely not

763
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,800
one. Right? So you have that. So you

764
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,079
have you see that this thing here this

765
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,640
is this here is zero. So this is just

766
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,560
the value of this the absolute value but

767
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,680
that's actually a half. So this is

768
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,960
always a half. Right?

769
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,119
So the function would converge uniformly

770
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,560
as long as

771
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,680
that if you right. So uniform

772
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,630
convergence would mean

773
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,829
so uniform convergence.

774
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,829
[Applause]

775
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,200
So,

776
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,800
so now let's show

777
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,800
So let's prove

778
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:42,760
that

779
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:42,760
FN does not converge uniformly to F.

780
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:53,599
Right? And so I just pick my epsilon

781
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:58,000
So

782
00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:00,400
I pick a epsilon less than half, right?

783
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,240
And then if it was converging and and

784
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,960
suppose

785
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,960
and suppose not

786
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,599
i.e. That is

787
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,599
suppose

788
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,720
fn converts to f uniformly.

789
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,680
This means that for all epsilon but I

790
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,119
just use this epsilon. Yeah, I just take

791
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:33,119
use this one epsilon.

792
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:37,839
But then I would have that there exist

793
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:40,960
capital n so that um so that I mean I

794
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:45,920
can even take it to to be equal to a

795
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:49,359
half. So there exist capital n so that

796
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:54,000
such that if little n is bigger than

797
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:59,359
capital n then this thing here

798
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:05,319
minus f of x would have to be less than

799
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:05,319
strictly less than a half for all x.

800
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,520
Right? If it was converging uniformly

801
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,480
then in particular for this one choice

802
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:18,319
of of epsilon you would have this for

803
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,880
all x but we already know that if we

804
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:24,559
looking at now depending on what this is

805
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,920
but that's fine you know if you insert

806
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,319
x= to xn then this is actually equal to

807
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,240
a half right so this is this here does

808
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:37,240
not hold this is the contradiction

809
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Okay.

810
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,480
Now, uh in the other example that we

811
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,480
looked at before,

812
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,480
um

813
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:58,359
in the other example, uh we have that um

814
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,119
in the other example which is this

815
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,480
example here.

816
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:10,640
uh this sequence here is converging and

817
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,839
I'll return to this in in a minute uh

818
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:18,680
that so in this case the these here

819
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,680
converge to f uniformly

820
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,400
on each

821
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,319
uh interval

822
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:32,119
on each bounded interval. So in each

823
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,119
interval of the form

824
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,599
minus L

825
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:42,160
to L. So on each bounded interval. Okay.

826
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,200
And we will talk about this more in just

827
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,839
a second.

828
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:53,119
Um okay.

829
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:56,240
Um and right because this is uh this is

830
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,520
this is uh this is the contact uh uh

831
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,440
content of the uh what's called bas

832
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,559
test.

833
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:09,119
So this hold more generally that if you

834
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:12,359
take a sequence so you see bias

835
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,359
M test.

836
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,880
So,

837
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:34,319
so in bio stress end test you have a

838
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,599
sequence of functions fn

839
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:42,240
and you have that this sequence. So fn

840
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:45,240
sorry is functions on some interval into

841
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,240
r

842
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:55,119
And then you have that the fn

843
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:58,800
uh is are bounded by some

844
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:03,280
some constant mn

845
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:05,119
and then you have that the mn. So these

846
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:11,079
are clearly non- negative numbers and

847
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:11,079
you have that this that this series here

848
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,960
this here is um is uh is is finite right

849
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,240
so this is a series of non- negative

850
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,079
numbers so to say that it's that this

851
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,559
series is summable is the same as saying

852
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,559
that it's finite

853
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,160
and now the claim is so then bias M

854
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,160
testers.

855
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,160
So,

856
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:44,800
so this is that if this is the case then

857
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:51,559
this

858
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:51,559
sequence converts to some f uniformly.

859
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:59,160
Okay. So that's why M test.

860
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,760
>> Yep.

861
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:14,800
Oh yeah. So this here so this here means

862
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:20,200
this here just means that fn of x

863
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,200
is lesser equal to m for all x.

864
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:32,040
Yeah, that's a kind of you know quite

865
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,040
common used.

866
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:40,280
Okay.

867
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:40,280
Uh so let's try to prove that.

868
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,880
So we are looking at

869
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:59,359
so suppose we look at suppose we define

870
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,880
sn of x. So this is just when you're

871
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:06,720
summing

872
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:10,400
from k = z to n of fk

873
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:16,040
of x. Suppose you're looking at this and

874
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,040
we want to prove so want to show

875
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,599
yeah sorry about that this is not what

876
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,760
we want to prove. Sorry this is uh sorry

877
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,480
I should have said

878
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,240
yeah this it's not these functions that

879
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,640
converge it's a sum of them. So what I

880
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,800
want to prove is that I want to prove

881
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:45,200
that this thing here as

882
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:48,760
k equal to zero to n that this function

883
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,760
here converge

884
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,480
uniform. Okay?

885
00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:00,720
Right? So think about it. You want this

886
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,680
to kind of probably apply to a to to

887
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,280
some power series. Right? And so the

888
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,680
individual

889
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:13,839
uh fk is like this polomial it is you

890
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:16,160
right it's some of some degree

891
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:20,480
okay

892
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:24,240
so so we define this function sn and I

893
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:28,760
want to prove that this

894
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,760
sn and then converge

895
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,960
and and and and and if It's okay. I said

896
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,920
it's better to call this something else

897
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,079
than little f to call it s, right?

898
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Because it's not these guys that

899
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:45,559
converge. It's a sum of them that

900
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,559
converge, right?

901
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,319
So we want to show that these guys here,

902
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:57,240
the sn

903
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:57,240
converts to this s uniform.

904
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,559
Right? That's what we want.

905
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:08,960
Now

906
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:10,800
let's look at the difference between Sn

907
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:16,079
of X

908
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:21,760
and SM of X. And so here I'm going to

909
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:23,440
think about N as being larger than M.

910
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,440
Suppose I'm thinking about this thing

911
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,440
here.

912
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:32,800
Well, this here is when you're summing

913
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:35,040
the first

914
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:39,040
I guess we're starting at k equal to

915
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,960
zero. So then we're summing the first m

916
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:44,800
+ one, right, of those guys here. We're

917
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,720
summing more. We're summing those guys,

918
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,640
but then we're also summing some some

919
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,599
more, right? And so this thing here, so

920
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:59,839
the the let me just write it out. So k =

921
00:55:53,599 --> 00:56:03,440
to zero to n of f uh k of x and the

922
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,359
second one is when we're summing right n

923
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,079
is bigger than m. So here we are

924
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,079
actually summing fewer

925
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,160
and so of course the differences

926
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:19,119
between these two are how many more of

927
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,839
these guys are

928
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,000
there than those guys. So this is

929
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:32,160
summing absolute value where we're

930
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:35,359
summing from k = m + 1 up to n of fk

931
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,880
of x. Right? So that's what it it's

932
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,559
equal to. And we didn't even have to

933
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,440
have absolute value, but in a minute

934
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,319
it's useful to have absolute value

935
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,680
because now of course this sum here is

936
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:49,359
less than than the sum of the absolute

937
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:54,640
values.

938
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:57,760
k = m + one to n and then we take the

939
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:02,319
absolute value in under the summation

940
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:06,559
sign like this right but now we can use

941
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:09,200
our condition here so this thing here is

942
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:16,240
less or equal to

943
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:21,240
the sum here from k = m + one up to n of

944
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,240
m k Okay.

945
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:29,040
But but those guys,

946
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,880
right? This is just a sequence of real

947
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,960
numbers, right? This is not a function.

948
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,240
It's just real numbers and they

949
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:39,280
converge. So this means that that so

950
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:43,200
this means that given

951
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:46,640
this means that you have that you can

952
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:51,119
make this saying here as small as you

953
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,640
want as long as m is sufficiently large.

954
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,160
Right?

955
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,480
So

956
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,480
so given

957
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,920
So given

958
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,040
so given

959
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:20,079
epsilon greater than zero there exist a

960
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:24,559
capital n such that if m here is bigger

961
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:27,559
than capital n then the sum here of the

962
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,559
tail

963
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:37,599
this thing here up to anything else,

964
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:40,160
right? Right. Uh is of this MK that this

965
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:43,119
is less than epsilon,

966
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:48,400
right? And so you see that this really

967
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:52,880
say that the so this implies that the Sn

968
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:55,359
for each X for each X if you can think

969
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,400
about this thing here as a sequence,

970
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:02,160
right? And so you have that that now

971
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:05,040
this sequence here is a cushy sequence,

972
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:08,040
right? For each x this is a cushy

973
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,040
sequence.

974
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:19,920
So this means that these sn of x they

975
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,599
will actually converge to something and

976
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:27,040
that's something I call s of x. So that

977
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:30,240
gives you a function s of x but it gives

978
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:33,040
you more because you see it's uh right

979
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,900
it actually show you something about

980
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,200
because this inequality here

981
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,000
[Applause]

982
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:44,799
that this difference here is less than

983
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:48,240
that that hold for all x right

984
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:51,839
so this means that

985
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:54,799
this means that as you're sending

986
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:58,359
so this means that

987
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,359
that you have

988
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:04,640
right. So now let n go to infinity. If

989
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,400
you take this inequality here. So you

990
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:12,960
have we have this inequality sn of x

991
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:18,480
minus sn of x

992
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:22,880
is less or equal to the sum here k = m +

993
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:25,359
one to n of mk.

994
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,799
So we have this inequality and we have

995
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:33,319
in fact you can write it as if you're

996
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:33,319
summing over the entire tail

997
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:43,839
right and so now this side of it this

998
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:46,640
side does not depend on little n right

999
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:48,960
this here hold as long as all here we

1000
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,640
required was that this here was bigger

1001
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,480
than that

1002
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:57,680
and so as n go to infinity. You have

1003
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:01,520
that s of x

1004
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:03,680
minus s m of x

1005
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,680
will have to be less or equal to this

1006
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,680
sum.

1007
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:14,240
And the key point here is for this for

1008
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:18,079
this size m test is that this here holds

1009
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:20,880
for all this inequality holds for all x.

1010
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,200
Right? You see the little n is gone.

1011
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,079
there's only this capital N uh this

1012
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:31,119
sorry the the M right

1013
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:34,799
and so now we again we can so if you as

1014
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:38,400
long as you choose some n sufficiently

1015
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:41,200
large then if little m is bigger equal

1016
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,319
to this n then you can make this sum

1017
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:47,760
here that have no reference to x you can

1018
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:51,359
make this less than epsilon

1019
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,920
right so this here is less than epsilon

1020
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:56,640
And you have this inequality for all x.

1021
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:59,119
So you have this one here less than this

1022
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,160
for all x. And that's exactly uniform

1023
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,040
convergence. Yeah.

1024
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:05,920
>> Um where did we get the first um like

1025
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,880
when we said that the sum of these k are

1026
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,280
less than ep.

1027
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,920
>> Yeah.

1028
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,960
>> Where did that?

1029
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:17,040
>> Okay. So the the the

1030
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:19,839
right so let let me just let me just um

1031
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,640
I I'll get to this in just a second but

1032
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:26,880
let me just say what is the strategy

1033
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:29,839
here so you have so we have this

1034
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,359
sequence

1035
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:34,799
uh maybe I erased the statement

1036
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:38,559
unfortunat So we have this sequence of

1037
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:43,520
functions on an interval

1038
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:46,640
and you had that this function here was

1039
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:50,079
bounded like this and then you had that

1040
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:54,480
these these are just real numbers and

1041
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:56,799
you had that these real numbers here

1042
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,559
was summable.

1043
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:01,680
So these are non- negative real numbers

1044
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:06,079
of course right

1045
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:09,200
and so then and I claim so the claim is

1046
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:13,119
that these that the sum here of these

1047
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:15,920
guys these here

1048
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:20,640
I claim that these guys here converge

1049
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:25,280
uniformly to some function s of x. The

1050
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:29,039
first step is to say that they actually

1051
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,799
that there exist some function s and

1052
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,400
they converge to that function

1053
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:37,920
pointwise. Right? In order to prove that

1054
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:41,599
I proved that this se this the this

1055
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:44,799
these these sums here for each fixed x

1056
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:48,400
is a cushy sequence. Right? Once there

1057
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:51,680
sequence for each fix x then they will

1058
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:55,440
be convergent and the limits I now

1059
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:58,000
defined to be s of x right. So that

1060
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,079
gives me a function and then the thing

1061
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,520
is that I have to upgrade this

1062
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:06,720
convergence which initially is pointwise

1063
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,920
to uniform convergence. Okay. And so now

1064
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:12,799
you were asking so now

1065
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,079
>> like why did so we got the sum of MKs

1066
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,799
but then

1067
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,599
>> where did we like how do we

1068
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:24,079
>> that's fine and so now so so this here

1069
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:27,359
was just very general and it just used

1070
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:30,240
this inequality that's all it used right

1071
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:32,799
now I'm using that these guys are

1072
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,520
summable so this means that if I'm

1073
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:38,559
starting this summation sufficiently far

1074
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,920
out then I can make it less than a given

1075
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,000
epsilon.

1076
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,680
>> Oh it's like

1077
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,319
>> because it's just like that these are

1078
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,440
non- negative number and that they are

1079
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:52,000
summable just means that if I go out

1080
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,240
really really far then from there on and

1081
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,640
out it makes very little contribution to

1082
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:03,520
the total sum. Okay.

1083
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:06,000
Okay. So uh right so

1084
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:08,880
right and so right so so you see like

1085
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,440
the first thing is

1086
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,280
for each fix x

1087
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:18,240
I prove that these sn of x is a cruise

1088
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:22,720
sequence that then allow me to define a

1089
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:25,280
function uh s of x and I get that the

1090
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,960
sequence sn of x is converging the

1091
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,280
sequence function is converging

1092
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,000
pointwise and then again Then once I

1093
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,839
have that then I need to upgrade it to

1094
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,280
be uniform convergence and that's what

1095
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,680
we did. Yes.

1096
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:43,039
>> Okay.

1097
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:44,319
Um okay. So now let's try to uh apply

1098
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,839
this.

1099
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:49,920
>> Uh yeah.

1100
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:52,079
>> So what if the MKS are a kind of

1101
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,880
converging sequence that

1102
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:58,160
>> but in like the small side the zero side

1103
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:01,839
is on a low index.

1104
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:04,160
So then like as I go further out,

1105
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,039
>> it's getting bigger.

1106
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,520
>> Um

1107
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:11,119
>> can can we look at an example and see if

1108
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,880
it become clear? Um so let's look at a

1109
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:16,640
sort of

1110
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,039
um let's look at an example.

1111
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,839
Let's look at it very yeah let's look at

1112
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:24,319
at an example.

1113
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:26,400
So in fact let's look at the function

1114
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:30,319
the example we just looked at but we

1115
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:32,240
said that it followed from stress M

1116
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,559
test. So what was the example I just

1117
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:40,559
looked at?

1118
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:44,400
So I take a function fn of x this is now

1119
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:46,400
x to the to the n divided by n

1120
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:51,839
factorial.

1121
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:56,480
Okay. Now I define uh sn of x. So this

1122
01:06:51,839 --> 01:07:00,400
is now the sum from k= to0 to n of this

1123
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:03,760
fn of x f k k of x sorry. So this means

1124
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:10,480
that this thing here is the sum from k

1125
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:15,039
=0 to n of x k over k factorial.

1126
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:18,440
Okay. And I want to show that this. So

1127
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,440
want to show

1128
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:28,400
that this Sn of X converge to the

1129
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:32,119
exponential function

1130
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,119
uh uniformly

1131
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:42,000
on on an interval of this form.

1132
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:44,480
So L is some fixed number and I'm

1133
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,480
looking between minus L to L. Right? And

1134
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,839
I claim that they converge. Okay? Now

1135
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:53,200
let's try to apply Bas M test. Right?

1136
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:57,200
And so what are the MN?

1137
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:00,559
The MN in this case the natural one is N

1138
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,799
to the power N*

1139
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,799
N factorial.

1140
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,799
Okay. If I'm looking at those numbers,

1141
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:12,960
these are just these are non- negative

1142
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:16,480
numbers, right? And we already know that

1143
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:20,159
this sequence of non- negative numbers

1144
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:22,640
is summable that these non- negative

1145
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:25,640
numbers like this that they are

1146
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,640
summable,

1147
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:34,719
right? And so then and suppose now I

1148
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:39,040
have suppose now I take this

1149
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:43,679
f uh n of x. So this is this function x

1150
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:46,880
^ n over n factorial. x here remember is

1151
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:50,960
in this bounded interval.

1152
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:54,319
Well, let's look at fn of x.

1153
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,480
So this is x n

1154
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:59,359
/ n factorial.

1155
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:03,920
But this thing here, so this is just x

1156
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:06,640
to the power n factorial. This is right.

1157
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:09,359
It's lying in here. So it's it's the

1158
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,880
absolute value is bound by L. So this is

1159
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:15,839
L n / N factorial.

1160
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:20,400
Right? So I have that this sequence is

1161
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:23,679
less than these m MN

1162
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:27,520
right and so now bias stress but it is

1163
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:29,520
it we restrict to this interval here and

1164
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:33,679
so now based

1165
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:36,960
M test tell you that that this that the

1166
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:42,159
sum here when you're summing from K to

1167
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:44,960
zero to N X K over K factorial that

1168
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:49,799
these actually converge

1169
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,799
to the limit uniformly

1170
01:09:51,920 --> 01:10:00,239
on but remember we we are restricting.

1171
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:02,719
So and the limit here we already have

1172
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:05,719
defined the limit to be the exponential

1173
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,719
function.

1174
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:13,760
Okay. Does that is that clear or not? Uh

1175
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:14,960
does it answer it or not really?

1176
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,320
I'm not sure.

1177
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,640
>> Okay.

1178
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:22,400
>> So I guess my question was y

1179
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,920
>> is is it that mn must be a convergent

1180
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,640
like series like

1181
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:32,880
>> Yeah. So mn that's right. So mn

1182
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:36,000
m uh you know in this example or in the

1183
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:39,120
general example it's it's it's

1184
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,199
you know so why so why is the mn so much

1185
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,679
easier to determine because they are

1186
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:46,239
just numbers they are just non- negative

1187
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:49,440
numbers and you're just asking if the

1188
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:51,600
series of non- negative numbers is not

1189
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,880
function it's non- negative numbers if

1190
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,280
that's convergent or not right and so

1191
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:01,360
since they're non are negative, it just

1192
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:04,719
means that the sum is finite, right?

1193
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:07,719
And so that's that's much easier to to

1194
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,719
determine.

1195
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,920
Okay,

1196
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:17,679
right. So now we can do this sort of

1197
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:21,580
same argument more generally.

1198
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:24,720
So this lead us to the following

1199
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:24,720
[Applause]

1200
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:30,600
that suppose you take a power series.

1201
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:41,440
So suppose you take a power series. So

1202
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:44,480
you summing here n = 0 to infinity a n

1203
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,400
xn. This is a power series right? So

1204
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,600
power series remember that a power

1205
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:53,280
series is where you're taking a sequence

1206
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:55,440
of fun of numbers real numbers and you

1207
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,600
think about these as coefficients in

1208
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,920
this polinomial and then you're summing

1209
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:04,159
o over them right but it's like you know

1210
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:06,960
the it's the a n is the coefficient to x

1211
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:08,800
to x to the power n

1212
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,040
okay so this is a power series and a

1213
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,640
power series again means so like you

1214
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:16,400
think about it as a series because like

1215
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:19,199
for each X it's like a regular series

1216
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:23,520
right but then it's like the value of

1217
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:26,159
that you get depends on X right and so

1218
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,159
for this we define the radius of

1219
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:29,159
convergence

1220
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:41,120
and let me remind you how this radius of

1221
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:44,000
convergence was defined

1222
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,600
you take the AM

1223
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,880
and you take the absolute value of it

1224
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:54,320
and then you take the n root of that and

1225
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:57,520
then you're looking at lean soup

1226
01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,480
as n goes to infinity

1227
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:03,440
right

1228
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:06,400
that gives you some number that number

1229
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,560
potentially it could be infinity

1230
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,480
it's always non negative but and it will

1231
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,800
always give you a number it could be

1232
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,040
zero it could be infinity and It could

1233
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:19,480
be anything in between.

1234
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,480
And then the radius of convergence

1235
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,159
of convergence

1236
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,719
of the power series

1237
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:40,239
is um

1238
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:43,199
so this is what I write by r and this is

1239
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:46,159
one m

1240
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:48,719
and where where there's this convention

1241
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:51,600
in this case usually you you know don't

1242
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:55,040
let divide by zero or infinity but in

1243
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:57,199
this case if m here is zero this means

1244
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:02,400
that the radius of convergence is

1245
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:03,760
infinite if m is uh is uh is infinite

1246
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,880
then it means that the radius

1247
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,280
convergence is zero

1248
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,920
and now this sort of slightly surprising

1249
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:16,640
fact but we proved this but I'm just

1250
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:21,120
reminding about it that that the the

1251
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:24,480
thing is that that the power series is

1252
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,080
convergent. So here you have zero is

1253
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,120
convergence

1254
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:33,520
inside. If this has the if this here is

1255
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:36,239
r it's convergent inside here and it's

1256
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,920
divergent outside but it's not

1257
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:40,960
completely clear what happened on the

1258
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,600
boundary. Right?

1259
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:46,239
So you have to check the boundary uh uh

1260
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,480
you know in you know

1261
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:49,840
separately and that that depends on the

1262
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,159
power you know there's no general

1263
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:56,159
formula for that.

1264
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:58,480
Okay. So now the theorem here is

1265
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:00,800
that

1266
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,880
so the theorem is like this and this is

1267
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,520
just generalizing this example that we

1268
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,840
just did and the theorem is the

1269
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:12,600
following

1270
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,600
that if you take a power series.

1271
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,280
So if you have a power series

1272
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:29,480
and um

1273
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:29,480
and R is the radius of convergence

1274
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:42,960
and uh L here is strictly less. It has

1275
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,199
to be strictly less than than the radius

1276
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:48,320
of convergence.

1277
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:53,520
Then um

1278
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:58,960
then these functions here k= to zero to

1279
01:15:53,520 --> 01:16:03,120
n a n a k sorry x k

1280
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:08,880
that these functions here converge

1281
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:08,880
to uh to this to the limit

1282
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,320
uh uniformly

1283
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:31,360
on on this interval here from minus L to

1284
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,440
L. But remember that L had to be

1285
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,600
strictly less than the radius of

1286
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,960
convergence.

1287
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:42,080
Okay. And so so this is like extremely

1288
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:44,640
useful like if you have

1289
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:46,880
um and and and it will be clear next

1290
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,320
time why it's useful because if you have

1291
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:53,360
uniform convergence then it becomes very

1292
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:56,400
easy to if you have uniform convergence

1293
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,800
then you can argue about if you want to

1294
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:01,440
take the derivative of integrating this

1295
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,280
thing over here. If you have uniform

1296
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:06,080
convergence

1297
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:08,080
then it will say that it's then a lot of

1298
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,159
operations

1299
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,560
we'll be more precise about that next

1300
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:15,360
time but a lot of operation like

1301
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:18,880
integration and differentiation you can

1302
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:21,440
do that over here and then go to the

1303
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,400
limit. So instead of you know if you

1304
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:27,520
were to integrate this thing here right

1305
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:30,159
so just say that but this seems maybe

1306
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,719
very very hard but the thing is if you

1307
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:35,840
can integrate here then you can just use

1308
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:37,920
the usual sum the usual formula for the

1309
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,920
sum that you it's just a sum of the

1310
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,719
integral and likewise for

1311
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:47,920
differentiation okay

1312
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:51,600
and so uh okay maybe I will just uh

1313
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:55,760
uh yeah maybe to stop here. I wrote out

1314
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,600
the but the proof in the notes. Uh I

1315
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:03,159
already posted the notes the lecture

1316
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:03,159
notes. Are there any questions?

1317
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,239
Okay, great.
