Welcome to the MIA 10-year anniversary

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,600
celebration. I'm Caroline Ooler,

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,840
director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
Center at the Broad Institute, which has

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,320
been proudly hosting the models,

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,119
Inference, and Algorithms MIA meetings

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,359
for the past few years. We're so excited

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,240
to bring the MIA community together

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,560
today for this milestone event. It's the

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,720
perfect chance to reflect on the past 10

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
years, celebrate all that's been

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,000
accomplished, and look ahead to the

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,880
dynamic future of MIA. A special thanks

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,160
to our panelists, Alex Blowmendal, one

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,800
of MIA's co-founders, Aviv Rev,

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,680
Alexandrina Goeva, and Gavororg

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,160
Gregorian. We're so happy to have you.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,160
MIA has been instrumental in bridging

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
communities across mathematics,

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,640
statistics, machine learning, and

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,800
biology. We've been hearing from leading

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
and emerging researchers about the

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,039
latest research that's going on, but

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,280
also the motivation and intuition that

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,000
go into the development of the proposed

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,240
methods. Again and again, participants

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
leave the talks having absorbed new

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,880
ideas that they apply to their own

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,040
research, and that's what makes MIA so

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,280
unique. Through these meetings, we're

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,720
proud to have built a community where

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,200
disciplines meet and new ideas spark. We

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,600
can't wait to see what the future of MIA

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,320
holds and the broader interdisciplinary

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,240
field it continues to shape. And now

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,240
I'll hand it over to other members of

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
the steering committee. Thank you for

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,600
being such an important part of the MIA

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,600
community.
