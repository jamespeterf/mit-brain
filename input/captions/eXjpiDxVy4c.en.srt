1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,880
energy powers our homes our cars our

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,799
lives but many of the energy sources we

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,280
use are rapidly changing the

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,600
climate so how do we transition to

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,320
cleaner energy sources what do

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,160
scientists still need to hammer out what

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,920
role will governments University

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,920
researchers and big corporations have to

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,240
play what will this transition actually

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,240
look like

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,960
what if it works is a new podcast with a

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,760
new approach understand the

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,760
solutions coming out of the MIT energy

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,800
initiative we will look at various ways

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,440
to address climate change we'll speak

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,559
with experts about the science

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,199
technology and policies that can

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,680
transform our Energy

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,879
Systems what will it take to remove

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,760
carbon from our atmosphere how do we

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,160
most effectively harness the power of

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,359
the Sun or use microbes to generate

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,560
electricity and how do we address the

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,280
hidden cost of powering electric

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,280
vehicles and electrifying our

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,080
homes join us as we hear from those

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,840
testing new ideas and working on

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
exciting breakthroughs in Labs industry

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,840
and government people who aren't afraid

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,600
to ask what if it

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,680
works join us on Apple podcast on

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,680
