00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,920
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,840
or SCAD is defined as a tear or a

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,839
separation in the wall of the coronary

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,920
artery, but it's not associated with

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,320
athoscerosis or trauma.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,800
>> Scad has been known to affect men and

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,600
women. However, SCAD most commonly

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,439
affects women. SCAD patients are often

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,439
healthy and without risk factors of

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,640
heart disease such as high cholesterol

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,480
or diabetes.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
>> SCAD is a rare condition linked to

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,480
arterial fragility sometimes caused by

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,360
well-known genetic disorders like

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,920
vascular ellers stanlo syndrome, morphan

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,840
syndrome and lois deed syndrome. These

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,680
conditions involve mutations that weaken

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,239
blood vessels and increase the risk of

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,239
arterial tears.
