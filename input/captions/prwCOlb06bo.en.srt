1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,600
and uh I realized I made a rookie

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,960
mistake because uh every title that is a

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,440
question you know hints that the answer

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,799
is no right this this applies to

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,639
headlines called very slow headlines um

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,439
right if you ask a question for a title

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,000
then means you're not sure so let me

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:23,119
rephrase actually yes AI is ready uh to

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
transform chemistry and Material Science

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,519
um so please take it on the affirmative

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,560
not as a question um and I'll give you

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,360
some evidence of why I'm sort of you

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,480
ready to say yes um you know you all use

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,719
probably experienced GPT right if

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,840
anything has changed over the last

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,520
decade is things that touch machine

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,559
learning and deep learning right we've

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,280
we've really been seeing sort of

19
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,199
transformational change at a scale that

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,600
uh that is hard to perceive since we're

21
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,719
inside it but you know go was solved you

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,600
know it was supposed to be an

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,440
untractable combinatorial problem and it

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,519
was solved a decade ago and you know you

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
can see the examples of you know things

26
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,519
that we thought require lots of human

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,640
creativity and human Talent like making

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,000
good images turn out they can be just

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,400
interpolated from known images in ways

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,479
that we really didn't expect like I said

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,439
5 to 10 years ago and then in the

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,560
physical sciences or in the in the

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,280
Sciences we've got our big examples over

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
the last you know four to five weeks

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,960
when two Nobel prizes were awarding two

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
AI Technologies right one for for for

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,520
the foundational work in physics and

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,240
another one for the alpha fall prot

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,600
structure prediction task right and this

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,040
has been a combination of compute

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,560
algorithms and data right being able to

42
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,240
deploy big data sets or make them uh put

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
them into this uh gpus that Nvidia makes

44
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,840
and that's why one they're one of the

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,360
most valuable companies in the world and

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,920
algorithms that are specific to the

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,159
tasks um and I for instance will never

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,960
write a cover letter in my life I'm

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,280
going to ask GPT to write a cover letter

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,399
for me and I suspect you know people

51
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,320
that apply for jobs that you companies

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,039
or my school are using GPD for cover

53
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,880
letter this okay we want that in

54
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,879
material science and chemistry right we

55
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,239
want to have ai tell us well this is an

56
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,440
amazing drug this is a absorbent that

57
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,319
will capture CO2 out of the air this is

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,640
a battery electrolyte that will enable

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,560
uh you know lithium metal batteries um

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,239
for Aviation okay well this is kind of

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,319
slightly different than what AI has done

62
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,680
in most other places right because we're

63
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,200
asking it to be better than the best

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,480
scientist has been so far which is kind

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,800
of a much harder task than just getting

66
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,480
a picture of an astronaut on the moon

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,080
right now we're asking for the best

68
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,200
possible picture of an astronaut on the

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,959
moon one I want to you know patent and

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,400
sell um and we're never going to have as

71
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,239
much data as some of his other tasks

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,760
right there's a lot more images in the

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:58,159
internet than there are electrolytes or

74
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,239
you know etching materials um to our

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,519
advantage perhaps is that we know the

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,920
rules of the game right physics governs

77
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,799
or should govern everything we do in the

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,239
in the physical sciences meaning that

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,959
there are underlying equations that we

80
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,760
either know and should be able to

81
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,159
exploit or you know can assume are there

82
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,040
even if you cannot explicitly write them

83
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,680
and although that's not necessarily a a

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,720
a foregone conclusion I'll give you more

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,720
um so what are things that AI does today

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,319
and you know maybe your companies do

87
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,560
companies out there do uh what what we

88
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,640
call actual property prediction right

89
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,599
just like um you know you trust a

90
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
Machine Vision algorithm to classify

91
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,480
whether a picture is a cat or not

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,959
because there is plenty of cut data to

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,040
to train it on if there is enough data

94
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,920
in the thousands maybe tens of thousands

95
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,480
of something we can totally train neural

96
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
networks that go from matter to property

97
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,000
and this could be you know toxicity of

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,239
molecules ionic conductivity of crystals

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,879
you know fluoresence of proteins so all

100
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,400
of these materials classes of chemical

101
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,680
classes have had neural networks make

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,439
for them that allow structure property

103
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,599
predictions um we can use AI for

104
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,959
synthesis planning right not just

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,799
telling you well this is a good chemical

106
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,519
but also to plan how to make it in

107
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,600
chemistry because data has been very

108
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,320
structured for a long time the chemists

109
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,160
are very laboriously collecting the way

110
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,919
they make chemicals there are big

111
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,280
databases and there are

112
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,120
retrosynthesis as a product services

113
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,600
today so you can just go to the Internet

114
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,039
and look you know chemical synthesis Ai

115
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,440
and you will find vendors that will give

116
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:41,120
you today the GPT version of chemical

117
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,199
synthesis where you say how would I make

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,039
this chemical and the AI says well buy

119
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
these precursors put them together in

120
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,960
this way you will be able to make this

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,280
molecule that exists today it's

122
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,919
commoditize for molecules for materials

123
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,479
is a little bit tricky right because you

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,960
know when when you say materials maybe

125
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,280
you're thinking of you know steel and

126
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,160
maybe here somebody else is thinking

127
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,199
about nanop particles for drug delivery

128
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,080
right material

129
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:06,800
are a a way more uh heterogeneous class

130
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,520
where we really don't record synthesis

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,320
in the same way right there's no one

132
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,280
unique repository for how to make

133
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,560
materials actually M make materials

134
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,639
could mean casting for some people and

135
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,199
it could make mean so gel for other

136
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,720
people so that's happening right now how

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,919
to have llms large language models read

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,440
this literature and deploy back

139
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,479
protocols to make stuff is happening uh

140
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,600
as we speak uh and then then In The Same

141
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,880
Spirit as these protocols there is llms

142
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,919
or agents for orchestration right where

143
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,600
individual pieces of AI with sort of

144
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,440
narrow Focus tasks coordinate one

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,720
another to orchestrate a more complex

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,280
function that we again thought a human

147
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,800
person would need to do right and there

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,479
is example in chemistry there is example

149
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,319
in in metal organic Frameworks which are

150
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,800
materials at the end of the day where an

151
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,880
agent reads a paper another agent

152
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,120
summarizes a recipe maybe an even agent

153
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,360
talks to the robot to make the chemistry

154
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,160
I'll talk more about that but in general

155
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,560
we're seeing sort of AI being sort of

156
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,160
the glue between different agents some

157
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,400
of which are Ai and some of which like I

158
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,720
said are a traditional simulator I have

159
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,400
a lot on on simulations or maybe all of

160
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,199
these are you know just Googling right

161
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,160
maybe it's an agent just goes and

162
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,440
Googles or goes to the patent database

163
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,280
and checks if this new chemical has been

164
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,240
registered by somebody else so this

165
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,120
orchestration is is definitely happening

166
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,880
as we

167
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,520
and then generative AI right you I mean

168
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,639
we've seen it work for faces in you know

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,240
2018 we already could make we the

170
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,599
community could make photorealistic

171
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,759
faces of madeup people um and over the

172
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:46,160
years we've been able to make you know

173
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,360
chemically

174
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,199
realistic versions of molecules to some

175
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,639
degree and definitely definitely of

176
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,639
proteins right protein design is we're

177
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,919
seeing it pick right now with you know

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,919
cida has raised a billion dollars out of

179
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,199
Noel award the

180
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,759
um David Baker it's definitely happening

181
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,360
right now and materials again are we

182
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,479
design an analo are we designing soft

183
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,919
matter this we've got a broader mandate

184
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,160
uh but the algorithms are coming along

185
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,759
as you can see from the date of those

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,479
papers things things are happening right

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,639
now um and then there is a place that is

188
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,919
particularly interesting to me which is

189
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,720
the combination of AI and simulations

190
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,879
because it turns out with if if we

191
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,680
really know the physics we can make

192
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,960
arbitrary amounts of data right we can

193
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,319
just simulate more we'll pay more

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,039
compute but compute is in is scalable

195
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,280
right you just rent another computer get

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,800
more data so we can generate data in a

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,560
way that most other tasks don't and we

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,440
have this very well defined

199
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,639
computational workflows that can benefit

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,240
from AI so there is in my world in

201
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,319
atomistic simulations when we look at

202
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,720
atoms from one resolution down from from

203
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,520
what Professor Bonnie was saying um

204
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,800
typically we get about three things how

205
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,360
well we're going to get the end energies

206
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,960
and the forces of how these atoms talk

207
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,840
to one another right typically we do

208
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,159
quantum mechanics really really

209
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,319
expensive how many atoms do we get to

210
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,639
simulate right typically we're C you

211
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,240
know tens of thousands hundreds of

212
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,039
thousands some some herculian efforts

213
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,400
can do Millions but but that's already

214
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:20,080
rare and because of the way we simulate

215
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,280
the world in one fento second increments

216
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,400
it takes forever to simulate materials

217
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,039
so we would typically stop at sort of

218
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,560
time scales of nanocs to micros it's

219
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,240
actually very hard to simulate something

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,080
like protein folding that takes

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,519
milliseconds so each and of these all of

222
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,599
these things are being actively

223
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:44,399
researched by foxm in my group but also

224
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,399
meta de mine Intel and Nvidia both you

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,160
know Academic Teams and and tech

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,519
companies are thinking about this Fusion

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,680
of AI and simulation so like I said ml

228
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,279
potentials Mean Machine learning models

229
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,279
that substitute quantum chemistry meta

230
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,040
has released 110 million on data points

231
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,640
to train these models on openly they

232
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,839
just put them out there for everybody to

233
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,040
use um and I I you know I suspect

234
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,760
there's more coming Deep Mind made them

235
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,120
but didn't didn't release them right so

236
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,800
kudos to meta for for opening data and

237
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
boo to to Google for not opening it U

238
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,880
accelerated MD like I said we can only

239
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,519
get to see Nan or microsc of time scale

240
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,399
but if you're looking at a protein that

241
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,480
is responsible for some disease its

242
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,600
Evolution takes milliseconds or maybe

243
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,680
seconds okay well how can we run this is

244
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,560
faster right we do this in my lab for

245
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,560
for battery materials right I want to

246
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,360
understand how lithium moves inside a

247
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,560
battery material but I cannot wait to

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,600
see sort of the time scale in a in an

249
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,519
atomistic simulation so how can I

250
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,040
accelerate while preserving all the

251
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,160
physics play some sort of using machine

252
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,720
learning as a surrogate model for these

253
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,640
simulators and something that again

254
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,959
we're pursuing actively which is

255
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,640
learning the types of Continuum or sem

256
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,160
empirical models that people

257
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,720
parameterize with pdes from the all atom

258
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,920
uh you know fully resolved quantum

259
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,519
mechanical evolution of of systems so I

260
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,800
have a couple of specific examples that

261
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,600
maybe will relate to sort of some of

262
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,360
your interest one is going Beyond

263
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,600
traditional simulations of

264
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,720
surfaces so if you've been close to

265
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,760
material surfaces you will know that

266
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,399
theoreticians typically model material

267
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,079
surfaces as a you know perfectly per

268
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,640
amazing pristin cut of the solid well

269
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,000
that's not how surfaces look like in the

270
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,920
real world right the moment you know

271
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,880
maybe you know at very low pressure when

272
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,800
you're doing epitaxy you know everything

273
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,519
is amazing but the moment things start

274
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,399
happening surfaces undergo

275
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,839
reconstruction you know some atoms move

276
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,040
around they creep up on top of one

277
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
another if you're growing a material the

278
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,560
material is physically stacking up more

279
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,600
layers all of this is Way Beyond the

280
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,920
traditional Assumption of tiny unit

281
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,040
cells that are P pristine um so this is

282
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,240
a place where machine learning can

283
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,800
definitely help and over the last you

284
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,959
know this was last year I put a paper

285
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,959
where we sort of we did the whole

286
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,720
two parts we need good energies and

287
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,120
forces so we train a machine learning

288
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,480
potential on tens of thousands of

289
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,639
quantum mechanical calculations such

290
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,959
that we can scale it to larger sizes and

291
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,040
and longer time scales so we we get sort

292
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,320
of we do Quantum we do AI to make our

293
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,920
energies and forces better and then we

294
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,120
do AI to sample the face space of what

295
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,720
the surfaces could look like um and this

296
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,160
is a diagram of sort of the amount of

297
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,959
learning it takes right this is not

298
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,639
something that people come in and click

299
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,800
a button yet this is active an active

300
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,959
area of research but it's possible so we

301
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,839
can make surrogate models of quantum

302
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,839
chemistry that are fast enough and

303
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,000
scalable enough that in this particular

304
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,480
example we were able to recover the

305
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,200
experimentally known reconstruction of

306
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,200
of a complex material like EST strum

307
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,839
titanium

308
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,200
oxide uh and agree with experiments on

309
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,680
sort of you know when uh as a function

310
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
of the pressure of oxygen and as a

311
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,360
function of the the composition of the

312
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,880
bulk we can get different surface

313
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,279
constructions and the stochiometry of

314
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,240
the surface reconstructions what atoms

315
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,240
they're made of we agreed with prior

316
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,160
calculations but how the atoms are

317
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,480
arranged we actually found more

318
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,240
realistic lower energy more believable

319
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,959
reconstruction that probably work hard

320
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,800
because AI can be more aggressive in

321
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,880
exploring these these spaces so I would

322
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,240
say surfaces used to be a big no no for

323
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,600
a for a ainal accuracy they're they're

324
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,959
at play now in terms of growth in terms

325
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,600
of reconstruction in terms of

326
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,079
functionalization um disorder is another

327
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
challenge that traditionally has been

328
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,720
hard to model in crystalling materials

329
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,320
right the fact that you know the crystal

330
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,000
itself you might have a material that is

331
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,760
perfectly ordered has atoms in a latis

332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,560
fine but then which atoms sit on which

333
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,000
latis can be disordered right and again

334
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,320
if you're in a world where you can only

335
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,279
simulate tens or hundreds of atoms you

336
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,480
can't really access disorder because

337
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,959
every pattern you choose because the

338
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,120
unit cell is so small and it's

339
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,680
symmetrical turns out to be order right

340
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,199
there is no you can't really simulate

341
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,639
this order H with traditional methods

342
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:12,480
well over the last year we have put used

343
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,680
the same Machan potential that I told

344
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,000
you can do energies and forces they can

345
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,240
do alemy and they can interpolate

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,040
between known elements representing

347
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,160
disorder this is a little bit technical

348
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,120
but I would say one of the big Achilles

349
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,000
horses of material Discovery used to be

350
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,480
you you're constrained to making small

351
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,880
unit cells and small unit cells cannot

352
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,600
capture disorder the fact that different

353
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,560
atoms in a in an alloy right you're

354
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,800
thinking about high entropy alloy for

355
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,720
instance where many elements can be

356
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,920
distributed randomly on very on

357
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,920
different positions of the ltis um uh

358
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,959
that cannot be modeled with traditional

359
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,720
simulations easily it's very expensive

360
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,240
but it turns out these machine learning

361
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,800
models not only scale in size but can

362
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,680
play uh this alchemical trick we call

363
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,480
where when we want to simulate a 90 10%

364
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,759
alloy of you know copper and silver we

365
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:13,320
can actually cheat and simulate atoms

366
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,399
that are 90% silver sorry 90% copper 10%

367
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,199
silver and they themselves behave like a

368
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,480
disorder alloy and you know this this

369
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:24,399
recovers experimental trends that are

370
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,120
that are uh nonlinear unexpected in ways

371
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,199
that go beyond classical simulations and

372
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,920
then my last example is well all these

373
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,720
is nice and Dy Rafa but you know at the

374
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,839
end of the day materials need to be made

375
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,560
and well this is exactly where where all

376
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,959
these tools come together with robot

377
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,160
robotization and Automation in the lab

378
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,639
um what we call sort of closing the loop

379
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,480
or autonomous research and and I have an

380
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,320
example here on molecular dice but this

381
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,759
is something that is sort of moving

382
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,720
around through the field we've also done

383
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,320
um polymer electrolytes and different

384
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,759
labs to different classes of materials

385
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,079
you may hear more about it today um um

386
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,120
and at the end of the day this

387
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,800
um this is about like I said connecting

388
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,079
this Ai and computational intelligence

389
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,399
to actual execution in the real world

390
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:17,720
right that that top robot is was made at

391
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:21,360
MIT was in in nature in 2023 by Claus

392
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,120
Jensen lab that bottom robot is from

393
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,759
Berkeley H the top robot makes molecules

394
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,319
the bottom robot makes solid powders and

395
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,600
this is sort of happening right each of

396
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,440
these machines costs you know multiple

397
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,519
millions of dollars and takes you know

398
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,839
multiple years FTE uh to get set up so

399
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,600
this is not trivial yet and and and it's

400
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,560
not commoditized yet but it's happening

401
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,759
um so in this example we made a special

402
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,519
nuran Network that blends Theory an

403
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,920
experiment to predict Optical properties

404
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,959
of dice right so it's a place where we

405
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,160
have tens of thousands of simulations

406
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,399
and we have tens of thousands of

407
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
experiments so we put them together and

408
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,959
we make this neural network that is very

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,759
good at predicting Optical properties

410
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,079
this is just a small piece because then

411
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,120
comes the robot and like I said big

412
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:08,600
shout out to Professor Jensen because

413
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,279
the robot itself driven by sort of all

414
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,399
these pieces of AI talking to one

415
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,360
another achieves what we said a

416
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,480
generative model proposes molecules a

417
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,120
retrosynthesis model tells you how to

418
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:25,160
make them um an actual Master controller

419
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,680
calls the robot to execute the

420
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,440
experiments we measure the properties of

421
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,600
this online all prop properties that are

422
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
amable to this type of robotization

423
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,920
right other properties you know if you

424
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,399
need a synchrotron you cannot do that in

425
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,680
a robot right you need to go to the

426
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,759
synchrotron and then we update the

427
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,639
models and do the same Active Learning

428
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,360
or basent optimization that Professor

429
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,600
Bon just referred to which is we look at

430
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
the models and they themselves identify

431
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,560
the regions that combine the most

432
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,800
informative new experiments to run with

433
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,480
the most optimistic outcomes you could

434
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,079
get right the math of this is well

435
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,160
controlled um you need to decide how

436
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:03,160
much you want to balance the two but the

437
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,280
math of how to balance exploration and

438
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,079
exploitation is well understood so the

439
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,199
model itself decides I really don't know

440
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,679
what's going to happen if I do this plus

441
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,720
this compound looks really really

442
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,559
performant according to the properties

443
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,959
you cared about and in this particular

444
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,559
case we went around the M ground three

445
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,240
times and hundreds of molecules were

446
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,199
made in this collaborative

447
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,679
obviously science

448
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:32,000
paper I will close saying that we at

449
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,160
Peck and I feel excitement about AI for

450
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
science in materials you can see we

451
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,400
we've seen sort of we're at the third

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,200
wave was a small molecules you know in

453
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,640
the in the late 201 it's been proteins

454
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,799
you know pecking now right the main

455
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,960
tools were the idea that this was going

456
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,160
to work was put out in 2018 2019 2020

457
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,080
and now we're in the material design uh

458
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
Peak and you can see these startups you

459
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,679
can see like I said the fact that meta

460
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,440
they just put out a catalysis data set

461
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,600
and

462
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
the day before yesterday Nvidia is

463
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,080
making AI for chemistry where we're

464
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,120
definitely at this sort of pick of

465
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,000
interest in energy and sustainability

466
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,600
and I think manufacturing is the next

467
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,280
stop it's coming the digital twins I was

468
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,240
on on uh two proposals for the digital

469
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
twin but you know the ones that didn't

470
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,200
get it um but it's clear that it's

471
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,799
coming right that's the next Frontiers

472
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,159
okay how do we hook this not just to

473
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,960
scientific research but to real world

474
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,640
scaling up uh and I'm excited to talk

475
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,080
about that too and with that I'll thank

476
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,360
the team and hopefully this a little bit

477
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,360
of time for questions thank you
