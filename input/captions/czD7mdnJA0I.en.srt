1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,600
thank you very much for the kind

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,040
introduction uh it's it's an honor here

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,759
to be among uh so many distinguished

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,839
colleagues and talented students and and

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,199
to be immersed in a almost a full day of

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,039
of great discussions and now have a an

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,080
opportunity to say a few things uh to

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,080
you so this uh this is the second time

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,279
this year that I drop in at at Lids the

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,160
first time it was it was for the student

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,800
conference maybe I should see if if if I

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,800
can apply for a premier 1K uh status

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,680
with lids if if there is such a thing uh

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,520
so uh this this talk will not be

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,120
entirely different from the one uh I

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,079
gave in February uh but it will be a

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,280
sort of a prequel uh and it's a prequel

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,000
in the following

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,879
sense

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,800
uh the control system Society has the

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,399
so-called control system Society uh week

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,079
which contains the uh control history

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,719
forum and its chair by Professor Alberto

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,680
isidori who asked me to prepare a talk

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,479
on the history of PD backstepping for uh

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,720
this year's um control history Forum

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,680
which was in October I felt that that

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,439
was a topic that might be worth uh

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,600
presenting

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,920
here uh and uh since you know history

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,799
really doesn't doesn't make for

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,600
necessarily an exciting topic to make it

33
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,000
also future facing I'm going to

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,079
integrate cre at the end some of the

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,159
elements of what was uh partly seen in

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,880
February and what what I had prepared

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,439
for the B lecture uh a year

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,040
ago uh I have to say that U the content

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,840
of a history lecture is

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,560
necessarily specialist oriented and I've

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,119
tested this talk once at a um plary

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,320
given at the Brazilian control

43
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,520
conference about a month

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,320
ago and uh one piece of honest feedback

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,039
that was given to me by the

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,719
founder by the person who founded the

47
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,640
Brazilian Control Association 50 years

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,680
ago so this is a gentleman in his late

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,959
80s was I understood nothing but I could

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,840
tell it was captivating so my my

51
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,840
objectives here are modest in terms of

52
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,879
uh the the the complete comprehension of

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,280
what I have uh assembled but I have I've

54
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,120
worked very hard for it to be coherent

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,360
and and reflective of how the the ideas

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,239
actually uh developed so the the the

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,800
talk will be uh two for the price of one

58
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:41,040
feature um 34s 3/4 history one quarter

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,360
uh future facing and let me be clear

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,040
that this was originally put together to

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,920
be a history talk in other words well it

62
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,560
would be nice to give a tutorial or a

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,040
survey this is neither it's it's it's a

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,000
it's a an exposition of the historical

65
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,120
progression of uh of certain ideas it's

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,640
for the most part chronological even

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,000
though that's not necessarily

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,599
pedagogically ideal

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,200
always um it's definitely not uh

70
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,599
comprehensive I put the emphasis on on

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,920
on the starts of certain

72
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,200
subtopics um uh and since it's a

73
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,680
historical account the attribution is

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,560
important I was trying trying to give

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,200
specific credit where uh uh that was uh

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,720
that was relevant you will see

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,840
that uh a big part of this this uh is

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,200
concentrated in a certain team and group

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,439
uh of uh of you know mostly my

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,599
associates but it was over the last 10

81
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,080
years that that this started to quite

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,120
rapidly uh expand and I'm very pleased

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,280
pleased by it the Future Part will be uh

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,400
a talk on how machine learning uh has

85
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,720
found its role or how I have found a way

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,120
to uh prevent uh drifting into total

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,159
irrelevance in the age of machine

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,159
learning and connect this

89
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,920
uh Broad and rigorous Theory with uh uh

90
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:13,439
with methods of machine learning so let

91
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,040
me start uh start with uh one slide on

92
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,720
what existed in PD control before the

93
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,000
start of the So-Cal PD backstepping so

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
for for about three to four decades the

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,520
efforts in in PD control were were

96
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:31,000
focused on um uh replicating uh the the

97
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,160
existing methods so so

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
lq uh with operator rard equations

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,039
rather than Matrix rard equations pole

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,600
placement uh there were efforts in uh uh

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,320
extending H Infinity a few of of of

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,440
those uh and um just to give a few

103
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,560
references uh these these three of which

104
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,280
I I note here that uh one of them uh was

105
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,800
co-authored by Professor sanj M whom we

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,360
all I think deeply miss in our field uh

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:08,440
um but all these efforts uh were focused

108
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,320
on um on U extending linear methods to

109
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,520
the infinite Dimension it is hard to

110
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,039
imagine looking at at at at at this uh

111
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,600
literature how it would extend to

112
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,039
nonlinear PDS or how it would be turned

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,800
adaptive in the way uh this this was uh

114
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:30,039
done for for certain linear and

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,240
nonlinear PDS so the root of the PD back

116
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,199
stepping actually is in feedback

117
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,639
linearization in the sense that in the

118
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,400
Fe in feedback linearization you have a

119
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,039
change of variables and feedback in PD

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,520
backstepping you have the same thing so

121
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,840
just a reminder of of of uh of feedback

122
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,840
linearization there is a system up

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,160
finding control with an with an

124
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,360
output uh you introduce a change of

125
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,800
variables with these lead derivatives

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,560
and at the end you end up with a chain

127
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,600
of

128
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,400
integrators where in the last equation

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,240
you have the control appearing and with

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,440
that control you can impose if you wish

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
a linear Clos Loop structure and assign

132
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,960
the behavior any way you

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,680
like now uh the the limitations of this

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,240
approach were immediately recognized

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,880
then people asked what about uh

136
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,880
uncertainties what are you going to do

137
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,120
if you have disturbances or if you have

138
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,840
a parametric uncertainty that is uh

139
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,440
really really large that you cannot

140
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,039
account for it with a single controller

141
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,639
and this question the extension of a

142
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:38,360
conization to these un uncertain systems

143
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,720
uh occupied intensely about half a

144
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,599
decade the first half of the

145
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,960
1990s and resulted in uh in adaptive and

146
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:52,240
robust solutions to uh stabilization or

147
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,039
disturbance attenuation in nonlinear

148
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,639
systems

149
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,960
so

150
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,680
as one of the participants in this

151
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,120
development and uh when I was done with

152
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
that I was looking at what to to do next

153
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,479
and and interestingly there were there

154
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,639
were certain uh applications uh and

155
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,479
activities and Consulting opportunities

156
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,000
in the Aerospace and jet engine industry

157
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
and I

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,039
realized

159
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,360
how narrowly I had been working up up to

160
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,000
that point how broad a space of

161
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,080
dynamical systems is when you step uh

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,120
step away from Odis and and uh look uh

163
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,280
look into to

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,000
PDS so the first thought was the

165
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,759
following so this is a a parabolic uh

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,199
partial differential equation where the

167
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,840
space is X Lambda is an destabilizing

168
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,240
reaction term and you can uh discretize

169
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,400
it in space only you keep uh the

170
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,479
derivative in time and this spatial

171
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,720
discretization reveals that there is a

172
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,840
chain of integrators here you see UI do

173
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,440
equals UI + 1 and you realize oh this is

174
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,240
kind of like larization so what what

175
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,240
this calls for is the going all the way

176
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,919
into the brunoski form the problem is

177
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
that the transformation into the

178
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,759
brunovsky

179
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,800
form uh involves a matrix which when the

180
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
discretization spa step the spatial

181
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,599
discretization step is taken to zero

182
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,879
because you need to do that if Lambda uh

183
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,440
if if the instability gets larger and

184
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,039
larger that this Matrix grows

185
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,360
unbounded so this is illposed

186
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,000
feedback larization taken literally is

187
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,959
illposed for for

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,479
PDS so I realized you need to preserve

189
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,839
the structure there is a there is a

190
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,240
differential operator there this this

191
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,399
lashan that needs to stay you can

192
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,680
transform this you can eliminate uh the

193
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,240
reaction which destabilizes the system

194
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,800
but you need to keep the

195
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,200
diffusion so I did that uh I messed only

196
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,600
with a destabilizing term lamb but I

197
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,079
kept the diffusion I replaced the the

198
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,440
destabilizing reaction with the

199
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,880
stabilizing

200
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,560
one and here's what what happens

201
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:17,040
there uh you obtain a gain which depends

202
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:22,079
on the spatial coordinate X so this gain

203
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:25,480
k um um is is a function of space and as

204
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:29,440
you take H towards

205
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,640
zero uh You observe a Divergence this is

206
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
is not the blow up but you observe a

207
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Divergence of uh of the gain into a two

208
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,880
valued map this is definitely not good

209
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,680
what this seems to be is uh something

210
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,760
that should be converging to a mean of

211
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,720
this uh two valued map but you don't get

212
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,279
it through the discretization so this is

213
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,839
a second me second message that doing PD

214
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,120
control uh where the first step is the

215
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:01,399
so-called lumping in other words the uh

216
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,240
model reduction into not is a dangerous

217
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,519
business we we did prove stability with

218
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
all of this with these discontinous

219
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,040
games with convergence in in the weak

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,040
sense it's a nice exercise in math but

221
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,760
that's not what what an engineer would

222
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,760
would want to see so early lumping is a

223
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,959
bad idea you want to design a controller

224
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,600
for a PD and then discretize the

225
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,079
controller in space rather than the the

226
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,880
other way around so let me um let me now

227
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,160
turn the attention to a slightly more

228
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,839
more General class of of PDs so this is

229
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,920
not now uh diffusion reaction advection

230
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,360
system with a non-local uh term and this

231
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,120
is inspired by Navia Stokes and and

232
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:46,839
certain other other systems in flexible

233
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:49,600
structures and uh in other uh domains so

234
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,480
here's how one goes about developing a

235
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,680
Continuum version of this uh of this

236
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,839
transformation one introduces a

237
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,600
transformation that contains an integral

238
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,480
in space of the state up to the current

239
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,880
position in Space

240
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,560
X if you think of this X as a Tim like V

241
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,399
variable you can you can regard this

242
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,880
almost like some kind of a generaliz

243
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,600
generalization of a convolution in space

244
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,279
rather than than in time so it's not a

245
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,600
totally foreign weird object if you if

246
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,760
you look at this discretized in space

247
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,000
you see that this transformation of U is

248
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,600
essentially the identity minus a lower

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,760
triangular Matrix an invertible matrix

250
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,920
by uh by definition so the

251
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,519
transformation of this system is into

252
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,040
something desirable and the simplest

253
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,120
desirable pedagogical choice would be

254
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,240
the heat equation the simplest of all

255
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,360
the parabolic equations which happens to

256
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,839
be exponentially stable so so far what I

257
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,079
present here is a wish list uh of how

258
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,600
one would want to organize a design but

259
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,200
is that

260
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,360
possible

261
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,639
uh what kind of a kernel

262
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,839
K would it take in this transformation

263
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:10,240
to obtain a transformation into the um

264
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,800
uh heat equation the answer to that is

265
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,680
that this kernel equation needs to

266
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,920
satisfy a certain PD in space I'm

267
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,920
leaving out the boundary conditions the

268
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,800
domain is not a rectangular domain it's

269
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,680
a somewhat unconventional PD which I'm

270
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,480
thrilled to say it's it's a special well

271
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,120
recognized class of PDs called the gura

272
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,720
form PDS and I have not seen a single

273
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,000
physical system for which gura developed

274
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,959
this P this PD more than 100 years ago

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,880
it it appears for the first time in the

276
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,079
cont in the context of of control

277
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,240
engineering so this is the equation that

278
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:51,720
the design the user needs to solve

279
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:55,440
offline before uh applying a controller

280
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,079
to stabilize this PD

281
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,240
now the first question that needs to be

282
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,199
answered is mathematical question is

283
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,279
such a PD well posed and how would you

284
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,920
solve it and the answer to both

285
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,480
questions is the following because of

286
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,880
the gura structure because of the

287
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:16,760
Triangular domain of this PD this PD can

288
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,040
be easily converted from a PD into an

289
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,680
integral equation doubly integral I I

290
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,320
point out where G and K are equivalent

291
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,680
there's just a just a change of the

292
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,000
spatial variables XY into c a i don't

293
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,279
need to bother you with with this this

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,760
is is beyond

295
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:39,040
Elementary so this and this is is

296
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,839
equivalent and this second object is an

297
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,519
object that can be treated with

298
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,440
successive approximations you you start

299
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,000
with a with an initial function for g

300
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,320
equals z then you keep substituting the

301
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,720
the resulting double uh Integrations and

302
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,800
as you keep doing these double

303
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
Integrations on on the initial uh

304
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,759
function which is given by the reaction

305
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,600
term you study the converence of of of

306
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,720
the resulting series you establish this

307
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,480
conversion and this this gives you uh

308
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,880
the answers to both the well posedness

309
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,720
and how and and one way to to compute

310
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,639
these uh these Solutions now what was

311
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,199
really thrilling was that uh for a

312
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,120
constant reaction term uh my student

313
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,959
Andre mishab was able to produce an

314
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,040
explicit solution to this PD which is

315
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,279
this this elegant but not trivial form

316
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,279
it it involves best functions but not of

317
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,800
X or Y but of the square root of the the

318
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,279
the difference of the squares of X and Y

319
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,160
something again uh ID syncratic enough

320
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,959
to excite you as something uh that's

321
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,279
never appeared in physics appearing in

322
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:52,680
in uh in in the in the domain of control

323
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,440
systems now the the original objective

324
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,600
uh for developing back backstepping was

325
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
that with uh existing methods you could

326
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,440
not even start dealing with nonlinear

327
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,279
PDS and perhaps with uh PD backstepping

328
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,680
you could so how do you extend these uh

329
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,839
Transformations uh and designs to

330
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,560
nonlinear PDS so I give here a nonlinear

331
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,639
PDS in F in which capital F could be a

332
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,720
function or it could be a nonlinear

333
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,800
operator and I postulate a

334
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,839
transformation which now instead of a

335
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,360
voltera integral s single integral has

336
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:34,000
this infinite sum of nested uh integrals

337
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:37,040
with increasing um with with products of

338
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,600
of you at different uh um positions uh

339
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:45,399
in space uh CJ and this is step one in

340
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,519
developing a very uh comprehensive

341
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:54,040
theory for um nonlinear backstepping

342
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:56,120
control of um uh of of nonlinear PDS the

343
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,440
target equation again there's no reason

344
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,920
to to take something super complicated

345
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,519
one can like in feedback linearization

346
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,880
go for a familiar desirable linear

347
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,959
closed loop system and and one such

348
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,399
system is the heat equation what does it

349
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,920
take to uh to produce a controller it

350
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,040
takes finding the solutions of uh for

351
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,079
these kernel functions these kernal

352
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,959
functions now satisfy not one but a

353
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:25,720
whole sequence an infinite sequence of

354
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:29,000
PDs on domains that that grow from one

355
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,800
two three up to to unlimited uh

356
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,399
dimension of uh of the domains and all

357
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,120
of this can be bounded can be summed up

358
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,440
can be proved convergent and can be can

359
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,279
be implemented so one slide on that I'm

360
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,519
I'm I'm not I'm I'm I'm going to um

361
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,480
leave it at that so what are the

362
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,079
possible applications I have to say that

363
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,759
for me the driving application that at

364
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,519
that earli stage of the development of

365
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,519
of this was was one that displays

366
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,839
probably a bit of vanity and that was

367
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:06,039
the Stokes is there is there a

368
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,959
more feared and more more more respected

369
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:11,760
PD out there than then nav sto so so I

370
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,600
thought okay this is this is this is the

371
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,439
one uh to drive the development of the

372
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,439
theory and to apply the theory too and

373
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,120
uh and we worked on that on the

374
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:26,039
conversion of this system of nonlinear

375
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,559
uh PDS into a set of three heat

376
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,440
equations with the with the convection

377
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,280
uh retain only uh uh eliminating the

378
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,200
unstable parts or specifically the

379
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,080
unstable wave numbers in in particular

380
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,039
geometry and I'll leave it at that

381
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,640
because Navia Stokes was just one of the

382
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,760
things along the along the

383
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,960
way um let

384
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,360
me no I can I can show this this slide

385
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,520
so this was the parabolic case and up to

386
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:58,480
that point nothing hyperbolic uh was

387
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,679
done and uh and turning the attention to

388
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,919
the h hyperbolic case you want to uh

389
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,360
look at hyperbolic equations that happen

390
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,919
to be open loop unstable if you

391
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,960
introduce uh this kind of a non-local

392
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,440
operator into this system and it's

393
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:19,360
reflective of several applications in in

394
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,159
various wave systems this is open loop

395
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,840
unstable with a backstepping

396
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,840
transformation of the kind that I showed

397
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,400
before with the first order uh with a

398
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,520
with a vola um um integral operator of

399
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,159
the second in kind one can transform

400
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,000
this equation into the uh transport PD

401
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,280
now for the electrical engineers like

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,159
myself what is this what is a transport

403
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,440
PD it's just a delay line that's that's

404
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,120
all it is a delay line in which there is

405
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,240
an initial condition but you're putting

406
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,679
nothing from from Time Zero onward so

407
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,799
this is this is not only an

408
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,760
exponentially stable system but a finite

409
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:00,039
time uh stable system that settles in uh

410
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:04,880
in one unit of of time so uh it's it's

411
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:06,559
um it's a nice uh type of stability to

412
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
uh to achieve and possible to achieve

413
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,440
and I'll I'll skip the details I'm

414
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,000
skipping the details because the the

415
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,559
interesting hyperbolic systems rarely

416
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,679
appear as one hyperbolic PD typically

417
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,679
they they appear as systems of coupled

418
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,200
hyperbolic

419
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,559
PDS uh I will show you some physical

420
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,120
examples but let me show you just just a

421
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:35,400
a a general form of two coupled counter

422
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,240
convecting I emphasize this uh this sign

423
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,240
difference in the convection term to

424
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,159
counter

425
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,120
convecting coupled hyperbolic PDS this

426
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,400
is like a Continuum infinitely many

427
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,559
feedback loops that can have a high gain

428
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,159
so this this can very much go unstable

429
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,760
and it does in in uh various application

430
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,760
domains so this was the first uh I would

431
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,880
I would say say breakthrough in which

432
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,919
Jean Michelle K Jo bastan and my my

433
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,880
student Rafael Vasquez participated and

434
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,039
one has to go to higher order Norms in

435
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,520
space not not just L2 not even H1 but

436
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:17,799
all the way to to the sub Norm Norm H2

437
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,679
to uh uh to achieve stabilization under

438
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:22,080
these kind of nonlinear perturbations

439
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,320
that are not only nonlinear but include

440
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,159
the perations uh involving uh the

441
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,440
differential

442
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,120
operator after you

443
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,320
design a controller for two coupled

444
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,120
systems what do you do well you ask

445
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,919
yourself can I do it for for more

446
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,799
systems that are that are coupled and

447
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,520
and are there applications for that so

448
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,960
the answer is yes we were drawn to that

449
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:51,559
we developed that with uh for for uh

450
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:57,159
coupled systems of N and M counter

451
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:59,720
correcting PDS with a key uh where I

452
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:04,200
want to emphasize that only one of the

453
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,840
two PD subsystems has a control input

454
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,960
that's the interesting part that that

455
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:14,159
you have coupled PDS of which you get to

456
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:17,200
control only one or only M directly and

457
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,840
you have to control the remaining n

458
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,919
indirectly to decouple them in in a

459
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,159
particular

460
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:29,320
way so um this was an effort of of uh of

461
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:32,200
several years and um ended up in in very

462
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,240
results uh but the maybe the more

463
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,880
interesting is what are the

464
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,799
applications well uh originally the

465
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,279
applications that drove couple

466
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,960
hyperbolic PDS came uh from various

467
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:49,279
researchers in France who were working

468
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,159
on the so-called senena um partial

469
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,559
differential equations modeling shallow

470
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,520
water waves such as those appearing in

471
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:59,880
water canals all over Belgium France and

472
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,720
so so on um

473
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,520
this was this was the motivating first

474
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,919
set of applications but then it all got

475
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,360
extended to oil drilling whereby o Dr

476
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:12,200
drilling I mean both the instabilities

477
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,440
in the structural uh oscillations of the

478
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:19,880
drill string and the instabilities in

479
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:23,159
the flow of uh the oil natural gas water

480
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,520
mud multiphase uh flows that tend to be

481
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,679
unstable uh tend to um develop into

482
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:34,039
plug- like instabilities that the damage

483
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:36,799
the equipment uh another set of um

484
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:38,640
applications is in laser Chambers where

485
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,559
you can can have therm acoustic

486
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,760
oscillations just as in combustion

487
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,960
Chambers I'm sorry to to forget to list

488
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,520
combustion here that that that's that

489
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,080
that's so natural in me that that's

490
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:56,360
almost uh obvious and uh and road

491
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,120
traffic uh um that that will say

492
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,720
something about uh um

493
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,720
a bit more

494
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,520
shortly uh so not listed in this this

495
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,799
set of applications is one application

496
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,559
that I would like to to Showcase because

497
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,640
it's simple because maybe there is an

498
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,559
occasional mechanical engineer in this

499
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,000
in this audience and this one is really

500
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:22,799
really clean and elegant this is the

501
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,480
so-called timoshenko beam all of the P

502
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,240
almost all of the PD control theory

503
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,080
sooner or later gets tested on the

504
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,440
so-called Oiler beam

505
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,400
but the timeno beam is the is is the

506
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,200
most complex of the beam of the four

507
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,440
beam uh models and it doesn't even look

508
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,320
like a like a beam it it is actually uh

509
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,200
a system of two coupled interconnected

510
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,600
in both directions wave equations and

511
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,600
this could could be a whole almost a

512
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,720
whole whole seminar I'll have to leave

513
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,240
it at that just saying that this is this

514
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,840
is uh two coupled wave equations with

515
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,120
different wave speeds and with a control

516
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,679
only at one

517
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,279
end

518
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:08,960
um this is done by converting each of

519
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,240
the two wave equations into two First

520
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,919
Solar hyperbolic PDS and then for those

521
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,559
four resulting PDS uh designing a

522
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,360
backstepping controller what's the

523
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,799
motivation for example the

524
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:27,240
um uh for example the attenuation of the

525
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:30,080
oscillations in the cver beams in the

526
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,000
atomic Force

527
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,520
roscopy all right so um after first

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,080
order

529
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:43,279
hyperbolic PDS one realizes that one has

530
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,960
in the process dealt with delay like

531
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,080
effects and one ask themselves what

532
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,679
about systems with delays I mean we're

533
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,440
we're we're Engineers we delays are the

534
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,919
one of the things that that uh worries

535
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,520
us the most and that we need to to to

536
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,760
compensate right around that time a

537
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,080
couple of friends were doing some very

538
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,919
interesting things with delay

539
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,840
compensation Anu here at MIT with a

540
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,559
So-Cal posicast adaptive control merg

541
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,039
Yankovich at at at Ford for for reasons

542
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,240
that that have to do with with the uh

543
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,520
Automotive uh Dynamics and the and the

544
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,840
effect of humans in in the loop and I

545
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,279
said wait a second you know I this

546
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,399
special case might be more exciting than

547
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,320
all of the general PD stuff that I'm

548
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:32,960
that I'm doing so I turn my ATT

549
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,799
attention to that and put a lot of

550
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,760
effort into this this this was single

551
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:44,360
authored work progressing from uh linear

552
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,360
uh ODS with an arbitrarily large delay D

553
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,840
that needs to be compensated to

554
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:53,679
nonlinear ODS with with a arbitrarily

555
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,799
large uh delay I I can't say

556
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,559
uh I have to limit what what I want to

557
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,720
say this is an exciting topic in which

558
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,399
the so-called predictor operator needs

559
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,159
to be uh developed but let me leave that

560
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:09,679
out

561
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:12,480
after uh after that

562
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:17,559
effort I came across several

563
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:21,200
applications uh some in

564
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:25,399
uh in a congested traffic in

565
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,880
communication networks some in uh screw

566
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:32,080
extruders

567
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:35,760
for uh add manufacturing or um

568
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,279
um uh 3D printing in which the delay is

569
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,640
present and it's large but it's not

570
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,120
constant uh it depends on the state and

571
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,720
you don't know up front what the state

572
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:49,279
is so we focused on uh system on

573
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,679
compensating non- constant delays in uh

574
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,720
nonlinear systems as as given here this

575
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,080
was the dissertation effort of my

576
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,880
student nichas bearus

577
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,440
liberus uh

578
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,240
so having uh observed that delays of

579
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,880
arbitrary length at the input or the

580
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,279
output of an a could be compensated the

581
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,039
natural next question is in in research

582
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,440
is I mean if you can compensate that

583
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,240
delay which is the simplest of PDs can

584
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,120
you

585
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,880
compensate less simple among the the the

586
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,880
PDS at at the input uh of an OD system

587
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,279
so I put an effort into

588
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:35,440
compensating par bolic PD equations at

589
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:39,279
the inputs of odies or higher order

590
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,760
hyperbolic uh PDS at the inputs of auds

591
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,919
or Cascades of hyperbolic and parabolic

592
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:49,240
PDS so this was an interesting body of

593
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,760
literature that that uh developed before

594
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,720
I even knew applications for it and

595
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,360
applic applications turned up within a

596
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,799
few years for each and every one of

597
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,799
these these things it's almost rule that

598
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,519
if if the theory is interesting an

599
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,720
application is just a matter of of of of

600
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:09,039
a conversation with somebody who's

601
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:12,519
worked on it before and and knows the

602
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:17,080
model all right so I'm now progressing

603
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:20,159
towards adaptive control um and um I

604
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,600
want to say that the Adaptive control

605
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,720
was the motivation of De for developing

606
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:31,080
uh PD backstepping and was uh finally

607
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:33,799
realized for all classes of of PDs for

608
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,039
parabolic in which the reaction

609
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:40,080
coefficient and this uh um kernel f are

610
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:43,559
completely unknown functions of

611
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,159
space for hyperbolic which where the

612
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,480
coupling between the unstable um first

613
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,200
order hyperbolic PDS are function

614
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,919
unknown functions of

615
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,919
space and for systems with delays where

616
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,880
the delay to be compensated is not just

617
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,039
long but it's unknown

618
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,440
and it can be both underestimated or or

619
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,120
overestimated so this was a lot of Works

620
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,679
years years of work which I just show

621
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,000
with a few slides so it's it's clear how

622
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,200
the this this history uh has

623
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
marched uh let me

624
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,360
now uh show two slides on applications

625
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,880
that have

626
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,039
taken uh more effort and consume more

627
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,640
more time the first of them is parabolic

628
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:30,640
it's um in additive

629
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,679
manufacturing so

630
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,519
the uh change uh the phase change in

631
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,080
materials between liquid and solid was

632
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,720
modeled for the first time in the late

633
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:55,120
1800s by uh by a physicist y Stefan or

634
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,399
Joseph Stefan as as he's also known uh

635
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,279
and uh this model is a very interesting

636
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:03,360
model where the Dynamics in one fa in

637
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,080
each of the phases liquid or solid is

638
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,080
are are governed simply by the the heat

639
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,159
equation with a boundary uh temperature

640
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,519
set to the melting temperature between

641
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:17,640
liquid and solid but the interface is

642
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:21,000
governed by an interesting OD the

643
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:24,159
interface is a scalar spatial position

644
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,679
quantity and is governed by a nonlinear

645
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,960
OD and what's interesting is that this

646
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:32,640
nonlinearity is not given up up front

647
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,840
it's it's the heat flux which comes as a

648
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,159
solution of the heat equation with this

649
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,159
boundary condition but it it is a

650
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,399
nonlinearity so this was this was a uh

651
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,039
this was an effort that that uh was

652
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:48,679
driven by a Manufacturing in the end it

653
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:50,559
was applicable to uh lithium ion

654
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:53,640
batteries it was applicable to

655
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:57,440
estimating the uh uh the temperature

656
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:02,000
distribution in CIS in in large blocks

657
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,480
uh of of CIS where you cannot access uh

658
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,399
the internal temperature and you want to

659
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,760
predict actually the the the melting

660
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,000
rates and how the things uh are are

661
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,000
doing but I want to point out in Lids

662
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,159
that this model of phase change is also

663
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,279
model of certain social uh social

664
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,720
dynamics think of the phase change the

665
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,360
the phase is an opinion on something and

666
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,480
one group of people holding a very

667
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,639
different opinion from another uh group

668
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,080
of people

669
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:35,399
and uh and this phase change occurring

670
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,440
somewhere somewhere in the space in the

671
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:40,919
age space in the income in the education

672
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,000
level space and this needing to be

673
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,639
either estimated though not measured in

674
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,880
internally or controlled and regulated

675
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:52,559
to a desired uh set

676
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,320
point the other uh application uh that

677
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,799
consumed considerable effort uh and and

678
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:01,760
gave good results uh was stabilized ing

679
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,679
stop and go instabilities in traffic

680
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,840
flows we don't need much uh introduction

681
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,679
to that subject I'm I'm pretty sure that

682
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:15,080
Boston is is is no better than San Diego

683
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,399
or LA in that regard uh and that that

684
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,279
subject that phenomenon is modeled by

685
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:23,760
two PDS uh one for the density the other

686
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,559
one for the velocity and where are we we

687
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,760
are in here our Behavior our driving

688
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,600
Style is captured in this term which

689
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,720
which involves the set point that we

690
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,799
kind of our our comfort level uh with

691
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,399
regards to the distance to the driver in

692
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,760
front of us and this pressure term which

693
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,399
takes a bit more to uh to

694
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,880
explain so this this problem was solved

695
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,360
and only solvable with with the with

696
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,919
with boundary control using using

697
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,960
backstepping a number of other

698
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,880
applications came up along the way so I

699
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,559
mentioned already water canals oil

700
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,720
drilling and lithium ion oil drilling is

701
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,960
relevant because back stepping was used

702
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,320
actually uh in experiments uh by the

703
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,720
Norwegian company stat oil in in several

704
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,039
kilometer long um

705
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:21,159
pipelines um to to to estimate uh the um

706
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,679
the downhall pressure uh it was also

707
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,639
used in in a project with RPA on

708
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,799
lithiumion batteries maybe 10 years ago

709
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:30,600
uh in partnership with with a with the

710
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:36,960
Robert Bosch

711
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:41,080
um um Outpost the the the the the US uh

712
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:45,639
um uh Institute um of the Robert Bosch

713
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:47,360
uh company so uh there have been some

714
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:51,679
applications of PD back stepping that

715
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:56,080
may may be quite nonobvious in vehicle

716
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,840
swarming uh the limit of having many

717
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,519
vehicles is a

718
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:06,840
PD uh and uh once one goes to that limit

719
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,639
things get easier they become more more

720
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:13,280
elegant the Clutter of a complicated

721
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,599
graph cleans up uh and and and you get a

722
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,119
PD and uh if you have a leader that's

723
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,639
your boundary input and that that leader

724
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,960
can can uh perform stabilization and can

725
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:27,280
p can perform also

726
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,679
deployment the instability of the Swarm

727
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,359
is something

728
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,679
typical of this effort typically you

729
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,200
will see swarms that are stable if left

730
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,839
alone they will be uh they will be

731
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,639
stable but you don't get interesting and

732
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,440
complex deployment shapes with stable

733
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,359
agents you get interesting shapes when

734
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,800
you have agents that don't want to be

735
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,399
near neighbors they want to run away

736
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,679
from everybody and you sort of reain

737
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,599
them in with boundary control and and

738
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,680
these these figures speak for for

739
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,720
themselves uh as as deployment figures

740
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,480
in

741
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,480
3D uh extremum seeking is a topic I

742
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,640
could have chosen because it's so

743
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,359
interesting you know so so so so

744
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,040
worthwhile to talk about something that

745
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,480
that's that's gone on to to to uh result

746
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,880
in you know thousands of patents and

747
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,520
Industrial applications but I just want

748
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:25,079
to say that uh PD backstepping has had a

749
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:28,359
role uh in extending extremum seeking to

750
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,960
systems that have not AI

751
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,480
but have PDS that need to be

752
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,240
compensated uh and that's the work uh

753
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,240
with Thiago Ru Oliva let me now get to

754
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,880
to to the uh merger of PD backstepping

755
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,880
with machine

756
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,640
learning

757
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:52,480
so uh today I don't think that a meeting

758
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,240
that I had uh had a conversation that

759
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,280
did not involve machine

760
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,760
learning and everybody has a different

761
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,960
role everybody's learning a different

762
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,079
thing uh so I have to tell you what is

763
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,880
my thing what am I learning learning

764
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:12,040
here so

765
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,640
uh one one thing that after you spend

766
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,200
decades in a field as a as a theorist

767
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,000
one thing thing you don't want to do

768
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,680
when machine learning comes along as a

769
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,119
disrupt disruptor of of your area one

770
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,040
thing I don't want to do is walk away

771
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,200
from everything is just start from

772
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,280
scratching just forget about the the the

773
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,760
the this complicated stuff that that

774
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,720
relatively few people can understand and

775
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,119
and and re redo it uh so that everybody

776
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:42,319
can so I found a role for machine

777
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:46,040
learning in supporting the modelbased

778
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:48,119
designs in other words there are a whole

779
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,880
bunch of modelbased designs that I sh

780
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,000
that I've shown you and they are

781
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,440
essentially Transformations they're

782
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,119
mappings from Models into feedback laws

783
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,480
so that mapping is something I want to

784
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,200
learn and automate before starting to

785
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,119
work on this I did not even fully

786
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,720
comprehend the complexity of these

787
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,440
mappings I've just been producing them

788
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,440
producing and producing them and and it

789
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,400
was only when I started thinking about

790
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,920
machine learning that I that I uh

791
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,720
started thinking about about uh their

792
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,760
internal structure and complexity so for

793
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,359
instance you've I I started with a

794
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,040
reaction diffusion equation where the

795
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:31,520
reaction coefficient is a function of

796
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,760
space Lambda of X my control design is a

797
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,920
mapping from the reaction coefficient

798
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:41,280
into the gain function gain kernel k a

799
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,599
lowercase k and I denote this mapping

800
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,280
with the calligraphy K this is a

801
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,440
nonlinear operator from an uh

802
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,040
onedimensional domain an interval from 0

803
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,640
to one to a triangular domain for the uh

804
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,560
for the gain

805
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,880
Cur well that is what I want to

806
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,200
um learn and approximate and you will

807
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,800
see

808
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:12,480
why uh I've been Computing these

809
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:15,359
gains lowercase k for a given Lambda for

810
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,160
two decades but then I asked myself what

811
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,920
is the mapping so that I don't have to

812
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,560
to compute it next time but I just plug

813
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,880
in into a into a formula uh which is is

814
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,839
a neural network approximation of of

815
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,920
that mapping in other words find the

816
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,440
mapping once and for all and you you

817
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,400
will see why once and for all matters so

818
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,240
before I I show show those details let

819
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,680
me uh make sure I don't run out of time

820
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,200
to to acknowledge the the the

821
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,480
collaborators so the moment an

822
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:52,720
interesting new idea comes up uh for a

823
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,200
topic that has a 20 plus year history

824
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,440
the possibilities are enormous and there

825
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,160
is so much to do for so many people

826
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,359
people so instantly within within within

827
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,599
6 Months 8 months uh these and now other

828
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:10,200
people have uh joined in uh in in these

829
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,079
these efforts uh some really incredible

830
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,520
Talent uh among them I I will not sing

831
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,280
out anybody

832
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,640
individually uh so let me now now move

833
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:27,400
on to illustrate what I'm talking

834
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:27,400
about so these La last 10 or so minutes

835
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,119
these last 10 minutes give enough time

836
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,520
to show one

837
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,680
example so I will not be going to the

838
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,720
most general of those those designs that

839
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,280
that I've shown you to to to to show you

840
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,400
how how we do that I'll go to the

841
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,480
simplest one among them there isn't a

842
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,359
simpler example imaginable

843
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,440
worth presenting pedagogically to

844
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,440
introduce this this notion

845
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,839
the the more complex things have already

846
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,560
been you know there is there is

847
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,880
considerable development on on more

848
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,400
complex

849
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,319
systems but this is The Benchmark uh A

850
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,839
system that is notationally simple but

851
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:21,079
conceptually definitely not trivial so

852
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:23,920
this is a transport PD with a

853
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:26,480
recirculation any chemical engineer in

854
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,920
in the room will not need much much

855
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,520
elaboration on

856
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,760
this uh but recirculation can can can

857
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,839
occur in in in more than just chemical

858
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,119
reactors that they can there can be

859
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,480
feedback uh being applied even from

860
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,839
routing apps to the drivers and

861
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,720
influencing the behavior of drivers

862
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:53,280
along the entire um freeway so you see

863
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,960
how the outlet of this PD is being fed

864
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,079
back everywhere within the domain with

865
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,319
this gain daa of X which I highlight in

866
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,280
red because it represents danger this is

867
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:09,599
the destabilizing feedback from the

868
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,800
recirculation and if the words do not

869
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,319
suffice I I show you here what what I

870
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,760
mean by destabilizing there are these

871
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:18,599
oscillations who which which grow as

872
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,160
time progresses if you apply if you

873
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,880
don't apply any control at the boundary

874
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,079
that can be actuated and the boundary to

875
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,480
be actuated is xal

876
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,359
1 okay okay

877
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:36,040
so let me

878
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,040
now step from the motivation to the

879
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,280
methodology I'm going to step step back

880
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,599
to something incredibly

881
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,599
familiar and

882
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,960
arising in a surprising manner in this

883
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,599
domain and this is the sensitivity and

884
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:56,240
the complimentary sensitivity functions

885
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,880
from our basic undergraduate or graduate

886
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,800
level robust control

887
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,920
courses when I mean when I say

888
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,560
sensitivity and complimentary

889
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,520
Sensitivity I mean exactly those that

890
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,079
that you know under those names and you

891
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,839
know that their their sum is the

892
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:14,480
identity operator it it won't be long

893
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,680
until until we hit the you know

894
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,240
Centennial of bodies work on on on these

895
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,680
uh these functions and the uh uh

896
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,119
performance limitations but I want to

897
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,960
talk about not the sensitivity functions

898
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,800
but the sensitivity operators not the uh

899
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,760
not the laplus transform of the impulse

900
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,400
response but the

901
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,960
operator from the impulse response of

902
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,640
the open loop system into the impulse

903
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,400
response of the closed loop system so

904
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,480
the sensitivity operator is this mapping

905
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,800
from the function beta into what you see

906
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,760
as the inverse laas transform of one

907
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:58,240
over minus uh the lapas transform beta I

908
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,559
use the positive feedback convention for

909
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,200
for reasons that that offer some

910
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,240
convenience in in notation and likewise

911
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,200
the complimentary sensitivity operator

912
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,640
is the identity minus the sensitivity

913
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,680
operator and it's given by uh by this

914
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,040
you know most famous of our formulas

915
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,920
formulas uh the laas transform divided

916
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,400
by laas transform plus plus uh by one

917
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,559
plus the laas transform um

918
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,680
so uh I don't think this question has

919
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,160
ever been asked because it wasn't

920
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,720
necessary to ask it uh in the context of

921
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,680
uh linear control to my knowledge but in

922
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,640
the context of what I use it for it

923
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,240
needs to be answered and that question

924
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,680
is are these continuous

925
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,200
operators and I answer with this this is

926
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,160
a theorem something that needs to be

927
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,319
proven I I I don't put any label on it I

928
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,000
establish that these are not just

929
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,559
continuous operators but they are

930
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,280
lipshits uh operators it's good to

931
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,960
actually have a uniform lipshits uh uh

932
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,839
uh

933
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,760
constant these lipshits uh constants are

934
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,640
valid for all input functions that are L

935
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:15,480
Infinity bounded uh by the constant C uh

936
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,319
capital B and which are themselves lip

937
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,680
sheets functions of their argument and

938
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:22,000
their argument is X so it's potentially

939
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,880
confusing I'm talking about the liip of

940
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,480
an operator and imposing a condition of

941
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,760
ousness of the input to the operator to

942
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,119
totally different

943
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:36,359
uh lip shitness con uh Concepts so these

944
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:38,200
are the lipit uh constants uh um for for

945
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:40,359
the sensitivity and the complimentary

946
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,960
sensitivity operator one more thing I

947
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:46,480
want to show

948
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,839
you uh follows from the recent work in

949
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,319
neural

950
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:53,359
operators uh an area in which there are

951
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:56,400
many authors but I'm

952
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:59,680
employing a theorem of one particular

953
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,440
group of authors car dakis at uh Brown

954
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,240
University and his authors for the

955
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:08,160
so-called Depot net uh form of a neural

956
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,200
network which says the

957
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,599
following so there's a theoretical

958
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,920
result it takes tens page tens of pages

959
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:18,240
to to prove unfortunately and it's an

960
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:22,200
existence results it says

961
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,680
that the actual operator capital K can

962
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:29,040
be approximated arbitrarily closely with

963
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:31,440
a neural network to an arbitrarily small

964
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,680
error uh

965
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,160
Epsilon and that's it this this is the

966
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,920
result uh provided provided that the the

967
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,800
input space is uh Compact and the

968
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,720
compactness is is ensured by assuming

969
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,359
that the inputs are uh lipes themselves

970
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,280
and bounded uh by

971
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:54,400
B uh I know that somebody will ask me

972
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,880
sooner or or later you know that's an

973
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,200
existence result but how big is the

974
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,599
neural network what kind of neural

975
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,160
network and so on this is not my area of

976
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,640
of specialty and this topic is

977
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:09,440
progressing rapidly whatever I say say

978
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,680
now might be an obsolete answer in in a

979
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,520
in a few months what I can tell you

980
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,400
though is that these being existing

981
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:20,720
results they are

982
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:24,160
conservative for example for uh I I know

983
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,599
that a sufficient condition for the

984
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:31,480
number of nodes in a neural network for

985
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:34,359
a PD whose um um recirculation

986
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:40,079
coefficient is bounded by capital B is

987
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:44,559
on the order of B to the power B now if

988
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:47,160
that b is 20 that's an enormous number

989
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:49,760
it's a sufficient condition but there is

990
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:53,319
now also a necessary condition the

991
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,440
necessary condition is roughly that you

992
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:59,559
need at least e to the power B nodes

993
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,520
so this is the truth about approximation

994
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:06,319
Theory it has nothing to do nothing to

995
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:08,960
do uh with with control or stabilization

996
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,359
there is a price to pay for

997
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,599
approximating

998
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:17,960
functions that can Peak very high that's

999
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,400
essentially uh this so let me now now

1000
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,200
come back to to this

1001
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,920
PD so that is the

1002
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,839
PD and the control of that PD progresses

1003
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,839
using uh PD backstepping I've shown you

1004
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:36,319
the PD backstepping uh transformation as

1005
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:40,319
the uh difference between the identity

1006
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:42,920
operator and a certain uh voltera

1007
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:45,960
operator of the second kind but I'm I'm

1008
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:49,240
now showing you that for this particular

1009
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,599
example this backstepping transformation

1010
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,079
is actually the

1011
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,720
convolution of the sensitivity operat

1012
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:58,200
acting on beta with a state very

1013
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:01,400
interesting

1014
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,880
and the control law is the convolution

1015
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,280
of the complementary sensitivity

1016
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:10,400
operator acting on the recirculation

1017
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:13,000
function uh with the uh with a measured

1018
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,280
state in the Target system the

1019
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,160
recirculation is wiped out by these two

1020
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,160
ingredients namely the backstepping

1021
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,400
transformation and the feedback law so

1022
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:27,319
now I want to get to to the key part uh

1023
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,119
of of this which I probably

1024
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:34,280
did not emphasize very much uh back in

1025
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:37,160
February and that is the simultaneous

1026
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:40,599
offline and online learning taking the

1027
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:44,040
form of adaptive control for for PDS

1028
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:49,040
with unknown functional

1029
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:51,480
coefficients uh if you you may recall

1030
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,880
that I was showing you a certain PD of a

1031
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:58,319
second order uh for uh the gain kernel

1032
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,440
labeled by lowercase k and that that PD

1033
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:05,000
can be uh converted into an integral

1034
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,760
equation uh whose state is capital G and

1035
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,799
so on so there are some some complicated

1036
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,680
PDS to solve which you cannot solve at

1037
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:17,480
every time instant as you estimate the

1038
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,280
parameter in real time so this is where

1039
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,839
the machine learning will be crucial in

1040
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,200
enabling adaptive control so let's

1041
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,760
suppose that this

1042
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,520
beta uh for which if known I could

1043
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,240
always design a controller is an

1044
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,160
actually an unknown function and let me

1045
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,880
denote the estimate of that unknown

1046
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,200
function of X as beta hat this now

1047
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,960
becomes also a function of time because

1048
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:44,960
it's estimated adaptively in real

1049
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,799
time how would you estimate it let me

1050
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:52,280
first get this out of the way how do you

1051
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:55,799
estimate uh this unknown function of

1052
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,760
space uh there are several approaches

1053
00:49:55,799 --> 00:50:01,200
and Anu knows this there's a there's a

1054
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,000
whole Forest of of of uh system

1055
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,599
identification

1056
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,599
methods even in continuous time or I

1057
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,680
would say especially in continuous time

1058
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,520
it's it's nice and elegant and and and

1059
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:17,200
pretty and one of them takes this form

1060
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:20,359
it's a it's a leono based gradient like

1061
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,400
update law in which Anu for sure and

1062
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:24,599
hopefully others recognize the The

1063
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,240
Familiar ingredients something that's

1064
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:28,200
called a regressor something that's

1065
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,280
called regulation error and something

1066
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,480
that's called the normalization exactly

1067
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,440
the details don't matter I need I need

1068
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,119
you know 10 to 15 minutes to get into

1069
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,440
those details but the structure is

1070
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:43,599
familiar this object what is it it's not

1071
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,520
a PD because there are no partial

1072
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,599
derivatives of beta hat there's only a

1073
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,480
Time derivative there are no spatial

1074
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:55,160
derivatives but there are integrals in

1075
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:58,520
in space so it's a nonlinear infinite

1076
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,440
dimensional orderin AR differential

1077
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,079
equation all

1078
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,359
right I will show you how this works

1079
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:07,079
let's get the theorem out of the way the

1080
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:11,480
one theorem I want to show you is this

1081
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:14,119
one because it it it's it it's it's such

1082
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:17,720
an effort to prove

1083
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:20,119
it um so the theorem in the most

1084
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,680
stripped down form there there are some

1085
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:23,280
assumptions certain things need to be

1086
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,599
small enough in the in the design the

1087
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,359
gain cannot be too high blah blah blah

1088
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:32,440
uh I I I I want the the key thing to be

1089
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:36,040
clear the main result is that this

1090
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:39,480
system is leonov stable in the sense of

1091
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:44,880
there existing a class K uh infinity

1092
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:48,000
bound on the norm of the entire plant

1093
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,720
State and the parameter estimation State

1094
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,599
expressed in in terms of a bound uh that

1095
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,040
contain the initial value of that Norm

1096
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,400
so this is how you want to claim

1097
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,359
stability and adaptive control every

1098
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:03,960
time and in particular when you're

1099
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:04,720
you're dealing with with a with a PD and

1100
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,160
in

1101
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,119
addition what you really want as an

1102
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,760
engineer is not just just stability you

1103
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,920
don't want just a bound you want to

1104
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,720
regulate something to a set point in

1105
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,559
addition set point regul regulation in L

1106
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,200
Infinity Norm namely pointwise in space

1107
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,920
is is

1108
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,040
achieved let me show you some

1109
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,799
simulations and then then I'll tell you

1110
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,839
come back to to to to close with with a

1111
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:34,960
few remarks on on the proof of this the

1112
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:38,119
so here's how how this works in open

1113
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,559
loop the system is unstable and you've

1114
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:43,839
seen already one version of this

1115
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:47,799
oscillating uh growth of the system

1116
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:52,000
State when an Adaptive control uh is

1117
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:54,960
applied you see this transient in which

1118
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,920
what's bad in open loop begins to

1119
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:03,119
emerge and is then suppressed an is

1120
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,839
smiling because I think I hope she

1121
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,640
credits me for being honest showing you

1122
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:11,520
the the ugly truth that you cannot learn

1123
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,280
things without getting in trouble first

1124
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,559
so I let the system get in trouble a

1125
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,240
little

1126
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,240
bit uh and

1127
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,839
um so here's what happens at the same

1128
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:29,200
time with the parameter estimate the

1129
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:32,599
parameter esate is

1130
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:36,520
learning and once it has learned a good

1131
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:39,760
enough parameter uh functional uh

1132
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:42,480
estimate the controller immediately says

1133
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,640
okay things are things are now now

1134
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,440
working and suppresses the instability

1135
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,480
and the moment the instability is

1136
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,799
suppressed the information the trouble

1137
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,480
is gone the learning is over and the

1138
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:55,440
parameter estimate is never learned

1139
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,440
perfectly and that's fine so

1140
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,119
no assumptions of persistency of

1141
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,839
excitation but uh regulation to uh to

1142
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:09,079
zero through a through a several step

1143
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:12,559
process of of uh of sort of uh incipient

1144
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:15,119
instability learning then stabilization

1145
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:19,079
and then then complacency of the update

1146
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,480
law because has no reason to learn

1147
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,920
anymore the proof this is what I'm proud

1148
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,880
of no I mean simulations are are great

1149
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,040
but the they they they they take

1150
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,520
100th of of what the proof takes in

1151
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,119
terms of in terms of time so uh the

1152
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,319
proof is complicated because there are

1153
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:40,720
three types of perturbations in in in

1154
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:43,200
adaptive control of this kind one comes

1155
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,960
from the fact that the the the PD for

1156
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,720
the for the kernel is not being solved

1157
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,240
online exactly but it is approximated

1158
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:52,440
with a with this machine learning object

1159
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,640
with the neural operator so there's that

1160
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,040
approximation error there's also the

1161
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,680
parameter estimation error which is

1162
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:02,000
killed by the update law and finally

1163
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:05,280
there's uh there's an error coming from

1164
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,680
the time derivative of the output of the

1165
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,200
neural operator uh which is being fed by

1166
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,359
the parameter estimate uh estimate uh

1167
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,599
beta

1168
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:19,040
hat so let me

1169
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:21,520
summarize the ability to replace solving

1170
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:25,400
the PD at each time step for each new

1171
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:28,160
estimate by a neural operator which is

1172
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,480
trained offline

1173
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,440
in a matter

1174
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:35,720
of minutes I mean this minutes are a

1175
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,520
long time with today's tech technology

1176
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,359
on GP on on on laptops with gpus this

1177
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,880
this this offline training takes minutes

1178
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:44,400
on on lap on older laptops it takes

1179
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,680
hours

1180
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,480
okay uh so this speed

1181
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:54,319
up uh this elimination of the numerical

1182
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:57,280
solution at each time step speeds up the

1183
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:59,640
implementation uh about three orders of

1184
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,240
of magnitude and that is what makes the

1185
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:05,319
difference between adaptive control for

1186
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:08,680
PDS being just an ocean which it was

1187
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:10,440
until a couple years ago and being

1188
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,520
implementable with that I I thank you

1189
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:18,310
for your attention and

1190
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:21,420
perhaps we can we can take a question

1191
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,420
[Applause]
