00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
The quantum advantage occurs when a

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,160
quantum computer can perform a

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,559
calculation in a reasonable time that a

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,800
classical computer is unable to complete

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,599
in any practical sense. It's important

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,920
to note this definition does not state

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,080
that the calculation performed should

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
meet any threshold of usefulness.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,960
Therefore, what we want to focus on

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,240
instead is a different milestone, one

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,560
known as quantum economic advantage. By

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,119
that I mean when a quantum computer

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,079
solves a commercially relevant problem

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,320
in a manner that is cheaper, faster, or

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,640
better than a classical computer.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,440
Imagine a scenario such as trading in

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,680
the financial markets. It's possible a

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,239
business would pay more for a quantum

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,719
computer to execute a multi-billion

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
dollar portfolio optimization task

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
because it provides even a small

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,399
improvement in time relative to

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,879
classical devices.
