14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,600
>> I'm finishing assignment two and we will

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,760
spend the next couple of weeks grading

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,239
him. Uh but uh you know, that was pretty

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,120
fun on Friday. So, so I think both

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,719
pretty well and um

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,399
you know we we've been talking these

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,440
past couple of uh oh actually

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
>> yeah we hope um we've been talking the

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
past couple of weeks about you know

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,840
serious games games games games games

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:53,840
games games games games games games

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,719
games games games games games games

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,920
games games games games for education

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,199
game as an art form as a means of

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,199
expression and we're going to be

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,720
continuing some of those uh discussions

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,280
later on um but the whole idea is sort

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
of give you um to sort of prep you for

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,720
the situation where uh you're going to

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,159
make a game for a client and for this

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,799
last assignment you're actually going

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,560
going to be making a game on a based on

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,680
a problem that these guys are going to

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,520
be talking about actually.

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,119
>> Sure.

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
My name is Jim Cartran. I'm a clinical

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,280
psychologist. uh work at Beth was at

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,840
Beth Djan just started at Brighamin

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,159
Women's Hospital um in one of the

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:38,240
Harvard mafia hospitals and um my area

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,560
is using interactive media for um for uh

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,400
both uh clinical training but especially

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,720
for treatment of clinical problems. So

47
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,920
building computer programs to help treat

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,520
uh clinical disorders in psychology.

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,240
>> Okay, it's my understand

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm a psychiatrist at UMass. I trained

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,200
in the same uh uh place like used to

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,119
work as uh and my focus is primarily

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,759
clinical. I'm I'm an attending

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,039
psychiatrist in a variety of setting

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,120
settings inatient outpatient and uh uh

56
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,080
what I brought up to Jim and then Philip

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,319
was a practical question that I'm going

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,879
to try to uh present uh which is helping

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,640
psychiatry residents deal with angry,

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,599
agitated and potentially disordered

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,760
patients as I'm going to say later. uh

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,000
this is a uh significant and largely uh

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,319
unknown issues. Certainly uh the

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
research is uh picking up and people try

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,840
to understand uh the extent of the

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,400
problem and uh um but I see more I'll

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,920
say it for for the presentation. So u

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,959
thank you for having me here. So um when

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,239
they contacted me um that there was the

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,239
initial interest in trying to make some

71
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,720
sort of digital uh uh piece of software

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,879
to to be able to help the the training

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,480
residents um in in learning how to deal

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:04,080
with violence or violence in in in in u

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,599
in mental in mental institutions um and

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
um and immediately the first thing I

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,400
thought well before we jump right into

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,000
digital let's try doing something in

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,319
analog first let's try um uh prototyping

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
something first but it also occurred to

81
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,680
that um in the real world of game

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,840
design, there's actually a lot more jobs

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
in game design outside of the game

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
industry and inside the game industry.

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,959
Uh there are a lot of companies out

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
there that are basically looking for

87
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,560
solutions, some of which may be games

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,879
and uh you might end up working uh in in

89
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,920
in some of those um in some of those

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,440
capacities. A lot of folks in

91
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,280
advertising for instance who are

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,239
involved in games. a lot of folks who

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,920
are interested in uh improving teaching

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,920
methods or improving uh simulations, you

95
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:55,680
know, working on um trying to think of

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,840
an example uh public awareness uh and uh

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,879
uh people who are also interest who who

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,959
are now working in website design and

99
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,879
you know v various online services who

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
are trying to think about how to make

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,640
their experiences a little bit more

102
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,920
gamelike. There are really really good

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,159
ways of doing them and there are really

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,400
really bad ways of doing them. And for

105
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,079
the most part, what we're hoping is that

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,280
if you end up getting one of those jobs,

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
you're you're going to be able to bring

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
some of your personal insight as having

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,080
actually done game design as opposed to

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,400
just copying what games have done and

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
and and just assuming well it kind of

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,040
looks like a game therefore it is game.

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,680
uh you guys that now. So, so, so this is

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,639
this is kind of get your feet wet in in

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,199
terms of designing something uh the

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,040
designing for somebody else's needs. Um

117
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
the the important things to keep in mind

118
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
is, you know, who's who's going to be

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,600
playing your game or who's who who's

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
this game intended for and in what

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
context are they going to be playing

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,240
your game and what are the particular

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
problems that you're trying to address?

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
what's what what's the part of of the

125
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,840
system that you're trying to to simulate

126
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,280
uh and what kinds of things do what what

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,199
what kinds of insights do you hope

128
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,720
people are going to be able to get out

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
of that the problem they're going to

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,400
talk about is huge is that um if you

131
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,120
notice I uploaded actually like four

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,199
readings to the class web only one of

133
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
them required but all of them are useful

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm going to be uploading more these are

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,240
all reference material for your team to

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,000
use um however you you wish because the

137
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
problem is so huge and vast You don't

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
have to solve the whole problem. You

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,639
pick one thing that you are excited

140
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,840
about, that you're interested about, and

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,560
that you think that you might have a

142
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,320
good strategy. And then do the the usual

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,080
brainstorm. We're going to be going

144
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,560
through brainstorming and team selection

145
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,120
pretty much this this week. Um, and uh

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,280
and try to identify some small part that

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,000
might be, you know, addressable with a

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,000
card game, world game or I'll talk a

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,280
little bit about uh role playing games

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,360
uh in a couple of weeks. So um with that

151
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
being said, I'm going to hand it over to

152
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,840
you guys.

153
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
>> Great. So who's first?

154
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,199
>> Uh Caesar will take the lead on this.

155
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,479
>> Okay. So we'll try to take turns to uh

156
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,120
talk about uh about violence and

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,039
psychiatry in particular. So uh as

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
Philip pointed out, violence is a is a

159
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,520
large is a large issue. uh what I'm

160
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,919
going to try to focus on is uh as I

161
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
mentioned earlier uh the relevance in in

162
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
dealing with uh psychiatric patients

163
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,600
especially psychiatric patients on an

164
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,240
inatient unit uh which is what uh you

165
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,600
know what they actually request or the

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,919
question for me uh came from um and uh

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,600
obviously uh violence can be looked at

168
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,000
in in a variety of uh of ways and uh uh

169
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,240
I think in in one of the handouts that

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,319
uh that I sent to Philillip, violence

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,639
and mental illness. They talk about uh

172
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,919
the biological the psychological

173
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,960
theories, the the social uh uh dimension

174
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,120
of uh of violence and how it can be

175
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,000
understood. If you look at the human

176
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,800
development and no matter what theory

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,479
you uh you consider either trai

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,479
traditional drive-based theory like

179
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,680
pride or or Ericson stages uh each seems

180
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,039
to define a certain um developmental

181
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,240
goal and and often achieving or

182
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,560
achieving in a faulty way that goal uh

183
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,759
can create uh um the potential for

184
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,039
aggression and sometimes violent um a

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,759
little child or or an adult whose uh

186
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:38,160
dependent oral needs are frustrated may

187
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,400
try to take over and and get those uh u

188
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,199
u you know those met in a way or

189
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,199
another. So

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,039
what I use as if you want the metaphor

191
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,080
for uh for uh uh the origins of violence

192
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,120
is the communication uh breakdown. at

193
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,599
some level uh something doesn't happen

194
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,199
right between you know the person who

195
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,000
gets angry and uh those around him or

196
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,199
her. Uh so in a more in the most generic

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,680
way basically communication as Lasso

198
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,319
said is about who says what to whom and

199
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,560
what channel and with what effect. Uh

200
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,639
the breakdown can occur at many levels

201
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,199
and again this is the the generic

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,400
reform. I hope uh I'll I'll make it

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
clear what I mean and especially uh what

204
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,240
can be done at a practical level when

205
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,560
you're let's say the resident on call uh

206
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,719
at night and the staff calls you up says

207
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,399
so and so is getting out of control

208
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
she's she's raising her voice

209
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,120
threatening pounding walls wanting to

210
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,680
get out refusing medications how do you

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,200
approach such a person and again the

212
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,160
intervention can happen at different

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
levels and actually one uh one goal of

214
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,519
uh of the training

215
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,560
uh or or potentially the game uh that

216
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,600
you might consider is what to do. How do

217
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,720
you establish when to engage fully uh by

218
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,640
yourself with outside help when the

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,760
intervention is minimal and you just

220
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,240
bring uh pens with you, restrain the

221
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
patient, use pharmarmacology. So, it's a

222
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,680
continuum of interventions. I'm going to

223
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,000
just focus on what to do when you can

224
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:19,279
actually engage the patient. Um

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,440
again continuing the the metaphor uh is

226
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,800
what people have what Walter Fish has

227
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,680
described as as this type of uh uh

228
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,959
narrative uh rationality as opposed to

229
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,880
the uh um to the traditional rational

230
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,680
paradigm that defines people as uh as

231
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,279
thinking beings that have actually uh to

232
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,440
make make decisions and and uh um and

233
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,080
base their actions on evidential

234
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
reasoning for aggression people. We

235
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,640
analyze the situation and come up with

236
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,600
the best possible outcome. Walter

237
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,080
Fischer talks about uh uh the fact that

238
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,480
we are all storytellers that we try to

239
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,399
to interact to understand others based

240
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,720
on a narrative that we have about

241
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,240
ourselves and about others. My my

242
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,160
assumption and again this is just the

243
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,320
introductory metaphor if you want that

244
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,519
at some point uh violence can be caused

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,839
by by a disruption uh in in this

246
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,760
narrative. Things don't make sense

247
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,160
anymore. We feel u misunderstood. We uh

248
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,480
we feel the victim of an injustice. And

249
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,160
th those principles apply to uh to

250
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,480
somebody who's who's struggling with a

251
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,399
mental illness where things are, you

252
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
know, have a much narrower window of

253
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,000
opportunity than than the for people who

254
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,760
are able to flexibly adapt to the

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,760
demands of of reality. Um,

256
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,040
so

257
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,959
we all know who this is and uh uh the

258
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,279
reason I I put it up and I have to admit

259
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,079
I haven't looked into the copyright uh

260
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,399
part of this uh I know there are uh

261
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,279
longer and longer copyright rules for

262
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,240
using cartoons so you'll have to forgive

263
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,920
me. Uh my point is that this is an angry

264
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,640
person. Uh and uh as a as someone who's

265
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,600
communicating, I think we get uh quickly

266
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,079
and and and clearly the fact that his

267
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,279
emotional range may be intense, but it's

268
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,600
fairly narrow. Uh doesn't cover white

269
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,000
light broad spectrum and and the

270
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,640
communication is fairly simple. He's in

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,800
distress. He's he's imposing his point

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,839
of view. He needs space. He uh he uh

273
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,320
could uh become uh very aggressive and

274
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,399
assaulted. I think that uh the language

275
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
is very simplistic. How would we

276
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,560
approach the Hulk and and trying to calm

277
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,680
him down and change his color? Well,

278
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,680
again, that's the end of my health.

279
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Um

280
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,880
briefly and and please feel free to

281
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,079
interrupt, jump in uh I can make this

282
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,800
presentation as long as short as as as

283
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,240
you want me to. There are many slides

284
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,000
but don't I'm not going to go through

285
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,560
every single line. I'm just using this

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,240
as a as if you want as a stimulus for uh

287
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
for the conversation especially from

288
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
from your perspective and from from your

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
needs. As I said I'm a clinical uh

290
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,839
provider. I'm a psychiatrist. I deal

291
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,240
with patients uh all the time many of

292
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,720
whom uh are angry or potentially angry

293
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
or potentially assaulted. And and I may

294
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
do things some you know after so many

295
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,000
years instinctively but sometimes I have

296
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,959
to think through okay this is the

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,200
situation. How do I do to to maximize uh

298
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,760
the benefit for for the patient I'm

299
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,279
treating and to keep myself safe? I've

300
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,279
been assaulted just once in in 15 years.

301
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,920
And it was like in the movies. Um a VA

302
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,360
patient, former Green Beret, who got

303
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,600
upset to the system and picked up a very

304
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,279
heavy armchair and you know lifted above

305
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,120
his head and I we we uh established eye

306
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,200
contact and I think he wondered what

307
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,480
should I do with this puny little little

308
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,720
doctor? Should I squash him or not? And

309
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,200
uh and in the end, I guess it was a

310
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
last, you know, split-second moment, he

311
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
decided to throw it, you know, to my

312
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,000
side. A large section of the wall came

313
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
down. So I looking I I was wondering,

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,399
you know, I could have been that wall

315
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,800
coming down. He ran out. It took him,

316
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,040
you know, a while to to be, you know, be

317
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,120
able to catch up with him and two

318
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,480
cruisers full of police officers to

319
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,760
subdue him. So I guess no communication

320
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,079
there. Uh he was just subdued. what's

321
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,880
the magnitude of of the problem? Uh I

322
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,560
think it's substantial and actually more

323
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
than 10 years ago there were some

324
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,680
isolated reports of of how significant

325
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,279
uh uh uh the problem was in terms of uh

326
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,720
trainees and especially psychiatry

327
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:51,040
trainees being uh uh the target of of

328
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,279
verbal and physical violence. Um

329
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,240
uh on this first page I I talk about

330
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,040
medical students. Uh in one study you

331
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,399
know numbers are relatively small uh but

332
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,680
again uh the study is uh uh 14 years

333
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,920
old. Um

334
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,440
a survey of psychiatry residents showed

335
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,000
that assault or threats of violence uh

336
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,760
are clearly one of the most difficult uh

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,160
events in their training. And some were

338
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,160
wondering retrospectively this is the uh

339
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,560
uh the right field for them. Actually

340
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,160
some students may wonder reading this

341
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,600
literature whether psychiatry is the

342
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,360
right field for for them to go into. Uh

343
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,079
and as you as you see uh uh the fourth

344
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,079
um in the fourth article almost

345
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,720
twothirds of psycho residents were

346
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,560
assaulted at least once during their uh

347
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,800
their training.

348
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
And obviously like with any kind of

349
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,480
dangerous situation, the risk of

350
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,120
post-traumatic symptoms can be

351
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,760
substantial either an acute stress uh

352
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,040
response or longerlasting long

353
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,639
longerlasting issues. The idea of uh

354
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,760
improving their training and their

355
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,040
ability uh to deal with the situation uh

356
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,199
has multiple benefits. Those who know

357
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,360
what to do are are almost never

358
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,040
assaulted. Not only that, if they happen

359
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,199
to be exposed, the likelihood of

360
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,920
developing post-traumatic symptoms, you

361
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,079
know, goes down significantly. So, uh I

362
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,720
don't think I need to to demonstrate uh

363
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,639
that point any further. Uh the assault

364
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,519
rate in a in a more detailed a

365
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,480
relatively more recent study, 10 years

366
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,959
old, pretty old. Uh you see, uh that

367
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,519
overall the number of assault rate was

368
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,279
30 to 40%. uh men tended to be slightly

369
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,240
more frequently assaulted than than

370
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,920
women. Uh

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,800
>> can you define what what assault means

372
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,760
exactly?

373
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,240
>> Uh what qualifies as an assault?

374
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,959
>> Assault um basically means kind of

375
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,000
laying hands on on the person and uh uh

376
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:54,000
the assault resulting in an injury uh of

377
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,120
of any kind. Skin, you know, being kind

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,800
of uh broken through or or some kind.

379
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,160
just just holding the per the the

380
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
clinician wouldn't be an assault.

381
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,720
>> Well, it would be an assault because uh

382
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,519
that such a kind of grabbing action

383
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,600
could actually result in a in an injury.

384
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,120
Um and uh um I think it would be uh

385
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
probably very limiting to talk only

386
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,839
about physical injuries especially since

387
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,120
the psychological consequences are often

388
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,920
uh the longerlasting and much more

389
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,800
significant. I think what the surveys uh

390
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,040
have shown also is that how unprepared

391
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
uh trainees in the mental health and

392
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,959
outside the mental health field are.

393
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,079
Actually often this is reduced to a few

394
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,959
lectures especially during orientation

395
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,560
and then they are thrown into the uh you

396
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,759
know lion cage and they learn on the job

397
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,880
u and uh many of these findings are

398
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,440
retrospective many trainees felt that

399
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,360
well I didn't say anything because I

400
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,600
thought I was supposed to just toughen

401
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,680
up and bite the bullet and move on or

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,440
this is part of the job I chose this

403
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,320
it's my fault or maybe I did something

404
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,160
wrong. Maybe I was the one who uh made

405
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,880
it so that the assault happened. So, a

406
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,079
lot of reasons that were just again not

407
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,839
looked into. Um fear of being

408
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,880
scrutinized. How come that I'm the one

409
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,240
who want assaulted among 10 10 trainees?

410
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,679
Uh how how I'm going to explain this? I

411
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,199
was so frightened that I cannot even

412
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,720
remember clearly what happened to me. So

413
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,039
there are a variety of reasons why

414
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
people who are in training and again I'm

415
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,600
focusing on and again with a ve on on a

416
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,919
very small segment uh specific group of

417
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,000
of trainees in a in medical and psychic

418
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,760
training but I could easily think of of

419
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,520
other situations of people who are kind

420
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
of exposed to the potential for violence

421
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,280
and and where you know such training

422
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,480
could be helpful

423
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,480
uh until now and for the most part the

424
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,840
data that I was able to collect that

425
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,039
most people you know looking at this

426
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,559
have been able to collect is fairly

427
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,919
limited Um there are certain you know

428
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,320
limited number of programs

429
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,120
methodologically the research is is

430
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,760
quite faulty. You can just talk uh about

431
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,240
you know how uh you know how limited the

432
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,799
generalizability of the findings are uh

433
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,400
and often people talk about what

434
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,880
happened in the past. So clearly the

435
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,200
recall bias is a major limiting factor

436
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,840
in understanding um what what happened.

437
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,760
Also as uh Jim asked me so how do you

438
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,000
define assault? One of the biggest

439
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,080
problems with with most research in this

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,600
field is that uh defining assault

441
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,840
aggression is done in very ways. Uh it's

442
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,280
hard to compare different uh uh

443
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,760
different studies. Uh so

444
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,160
this is a compilation of uh of what

445
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,480
people in you know different areas have

446
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,559
have thought about in terms of improving

447
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,960
their psychiatric training. And as you

448
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:53,200
see most often uh in the last few years,

449
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,320
the idea of using simulation uh to uh

450
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,120
expose the trainees to a uh to a

451
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,440
protected environment that has really

452
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,320
defined boundaries and consequences and

453
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,559
basically uh that can be repeated almost

454
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,440
in identical fashion in order to gain

455
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,840
proficiency. Uh you know is is coming up

456
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,400
more and more. Uh what uh many training

457
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,880
programs uh are doing is to use

458
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,080
standardized patients that are uh that

459
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,360
use actors um and that of course will

460
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,760
behave in a in a uh uh kind of

461
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,679
programmed fashion. They may get up to

462
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,600
you and make fists, but hopefully

463
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,000
they'll not get so much into the role

464
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,799
and end up punching you. So

465
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,280
>> I think this is the real challenge is

466
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,120
that there's there's different levels of

467
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
of learning. You can learn kind of a

468
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,160
list of facts, things to do if your

469
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,600
patient starts to get agitated and

470
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,039
threatening. And you know, you can learn

471
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,480
that and take a test on it and forget it

472
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,440
the next day, especially if it doesn't

473
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
come up for you right away. Um, and then

474
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,400
there's there's the question of

475
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,840
internalizing it so you actually have a

476
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,520
not just a kind of a working knowledge

477
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,760
of really understand what you should do

478
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,320
in different kinds of circumstances. And

479
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,919
that's where the um the idea of role

480
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,160
playing with live role plays for the

481
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,160
trainees for the residents and mental

482
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,880
health providers can really be helpful

483
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:15,760
so that they've had some se semblance of

484
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,120
this kind of um training. Um but it's

485
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,160
the the tricky thing with these role

486
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,120
plays is it's not easy to ensure that

487
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,280
everybody receives you know high quality

488
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
access to you know well-trained actor

489
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,919
you here in you know Harvard Medical

490
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,440
School they probably do probably but you

491
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,280
know there's a lot of places and if you

492
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,880
expand beyond psychiatry to every mental

493
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,320
health center in the country every case

494
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,960
worker who's going out to visit a

495
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,000
patient at their home or social worker

496
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,960
you know they're definitely not getting

497
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,720
this kind of training and so you know

498
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,640
the ones really I think you said before

499
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,080
are really well trained are the nurses

500
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
actually because they they they get a

501
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,360
different kind of training that's really

502
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,440
pretty effective it sounds like but the

503
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,799
mental health care providers often have

504
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,320
no training and then they're the ones

505
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,039
who are kind of in a closed room with

506
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,200
the person who can become really violent

507
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,919
especially at their home or in inatient

508
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,679
unit.

509
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,760
>> Yeah Jim was making reference to that

510
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,600
psychiatrist at MGH who last year was

511
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,120
stabbed by a patient in the outpatient

512
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,039
clinic in a rather

513
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,880
>> you don't hear about this last year.

514
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,880
>> Can you just describe the situation?

515
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,400
Well, it was late in the evening when

516
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
most things like this have this

517
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,799
potential of happening and this was a

518
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,919
new evaluation for uh this psychiatrist

519
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,120
in the life of the clinic at MGH and

520
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,120
basically he he was angry from the

521
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,480
beginning and was able to staff

522
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,880
repeatedly. Uh an offg guard, you know,

523
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,960
person just happened to walk by.

524
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,440
>> Was that police officer? Uh yeah, he was

525
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,520
one of the security uh uh people for

526
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,520
that particular clinic and he came

527
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,159
apparently had a gun. I don't know how

528
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,799
often offduty security people carry

529
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,120
their guns with him but he opened fire

530
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,799
and killed the the patient. So he was

531
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,799
charged I think

532
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,000
>> yeah eventually was cleared but for

533
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,840
using excessive force.

534
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,159
>> What happened to the psychiatrist? Well,

535
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,520
psychiatrist was admitted and uh to a

536
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,000
hospital and required, you know,

537
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,600
extensive surgeries and I think um she

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,480
was stabbed in the chest and in the neck

539
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,200
and it was a fairly gruesome. She

540
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,919
survived and I think she's back at work.

541
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,640
But this is an extreme case and uh I'm

542
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,799
afraid that uh many of the things that

543
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,440
we talk about and principles that we may

544
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,559
come up with may not necessarily be uh

545
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,559
uh so helpful other than thinking back

546
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,799
at a level intervention. It's quite

547
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,640
conceivable that for somebody who

548
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,000
charges at you, you won't be able to

549
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,360
talk him down. You won't be able to use

550
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,200
any of the uh nice deescalation

551
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,919
principles that I'm going to talk about

552
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,080
in a few minutes. But figuring out what

553
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,520
to do, I think it remains important.

554
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,320
>> Um so I have a question. You mentioned

555
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,720
that nurses have sort of like a

556
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,080
different training system for this and

557
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,240
and it seems to be effective. Like what

558
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,080
what what is that training? like what is

559
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,039
different about what nurses get taught

560
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,440
in the

561
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:11,039
>> Well, um there are some in most states

562
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,840
there are uh regulations that um try to

563
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,159
implement some level of training for

564
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,320
designed specifically for patients who

565
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,880
get out of control and that's not in

566
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,120
only psychiatry. uh emergency room uh

567
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,919
teams have probably the most one of the

568
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,159
most kind of the highest rate of of

569
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,559
assaulted patients across uh across

570
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,080
diagnostic boundaries. Often psychiatric

571
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,480
patients especially patients using

572
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,880
substance abuse will will uh will get

573
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,200
out of control emergency room. So if you

574
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,679
want to become emergency physician or

575
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
you if you work in the field an EMT or

576
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,679
another capacity you'll have to deal

577
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,000
with these situations. what what makes

578
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,080
the nurses uh somewhat better trained is

579
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,720
that uh um they often are the frontline

580
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,240
uh uh staff dealing with out of control

581
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
patients and I think that's probably

582
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,400
pretty probably sad because physicians

583
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,080
should be equally you know and trainees

584
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,960
and physicians in training should be

585
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,159
equally well well trained but uh but on

586
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,000
the nursing front uh there has been some

587
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,279
progress in Massachusetts the department

588
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
of mental health uh has some method of

589
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,600
retraining there's a lot of red tape

590
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,559
there. But there are a lot of um helpful

591
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,600
helpful aspects uh including aspects

592
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:27,120
related to self-defense

593
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,200
and I wish I I could have presented a

594
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,400
recording of of a of a training session

595
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,159
for staff. Uh it's when I went through

596
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,799
it I I thought it would be something

597
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,960
like a very spectacular kind of kung fu

598
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,120
how you do it. But in fact uh the

599
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,960
emphasis is how to keep yourself safe

600
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,440
and believe it or not how to keep the

601
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,039
person safe. the person that you're kind

602
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,520
of blocking the way punches uh the

603
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,440
person that might be trying to kind of

604
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,559
strangle you or or keep you in a

605
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
stronghold or or scratch you or you know

606
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,320
rip your your hair again even when you

607
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
try to intervene or you're trying you're

608
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,640
trying to protect yourself and keep the

609
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,480
other other person safe. So no punching,

610
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,039
kicking, no kind of spectacular

611
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,480
kind of stunts in that respect. But

612
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,720
again that also I feel could be you know

613
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,520
an interesting topic for for simulation.

614
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,080
How do you kind of interact with uh

615
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,440
especially since again I'm I'm a total

616
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,520
kind of outsider in the field but I um

617
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,960
having kids you know they they were

618
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,880
asking me the other day about

619
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,480
Microsoft's connects uh connect um and I

620
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,000
thought that was really interesting

621
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,799
because the level of interaction with uh

622
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,720
kind of computerenerated uh interfaces

623
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,840
is very is very interesting and

624
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,679
certainly would be a that to be attacked

625
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,159
by by somebody from the TV

626
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,159
person.

627
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,720
>> It sounds like nurses get better

628
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,679
training because the states require them

629
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,080
to have better training.

630
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,200
>> Yes.

631
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,600
>> Okay. That's correct.

632
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
>> All right.

633
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,400
>> That that's in part of it. And I've been

634
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,200
trying at at UMass to to suggest that

635
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,000
not only the staff physicians get

636
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,520
exposed to the training but even the um

637
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,360
psychiatry trainees and other trainees

638
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,360
especially in an emergency medicine.

639
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,640
they they should all really, you know,

640
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,840
know about it.

641
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,760
>> I suspect some of this has to do with

642
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,440
with the benefits of being in a union,

643
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,520
which the union can demand that the

644
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,799
nurses receive this better training

645
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,080
where the physicians are not in the

646
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,159
union.

647
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,480
>> Uh, and it's also about numbers. I mean,

648
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,640
on the on any unit, you know, the you

649
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,039
have uh six, seven nurses per one

650
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,600
physician uh and the nurses are they're

651
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,640
in shifts around the clock. So the lackl

652
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,080
of being exposed to a uh to an out of

653
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,840
control you know much higher usually on

654
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,400
on these units people intervene as a

655
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,640
team uh and there's a team leader that

656
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,279
tries to you know applies many of the

657
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,080
principles I I hope to talk about uh and

658
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,480
then if there is need for seclusionary

659
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,480
strength then that has to be done in an

660
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,760
automated fashion and and things are

661
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,360
clearly much much clearer as I said on

662
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,640
the nursing front maybe because they're

663
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,520
doing it all the time because there are

664
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,480
some ty relations maybe because they're

665
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,600
unionized and

666
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,440
you know at least half of the literature

667
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,679
uh really comes from from the nursing

668
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,279
direction. So uh so that's a that's a

669
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,520
tangent

670
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,320
just want to write on the on the connect

671
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,440
uh uh uh comment that you were making. I

672
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,000
mean we will be talking a little bit

673
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,840
more about live action games. So, um,

674
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,440
that's kind of how you prototype how you

675
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,760
prototype something that's going to be a

676
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,919
motion gesture computer game. You don't

677
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,480
obviously actually having to write code

678
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,799
to do that. That sort of body

679
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,200
recognition is kind of annoying uh and

680
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,000
and expensive, but it's but you can test

681
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,760
out a lot of ideas uh just by having two

682
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,799
people play physical game. Of course,

683
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,000
safety becomes the biggest concern for

684
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,440
players as well. It's kind of

685
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,960
interesting because in this particular

686
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,720
case, you're trying to teach someone how

687
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,720
to prevent damage to both parties at the

688
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,320
same time, which is an interesting it

689
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,279
actually kind of helps you with the

690
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,559
design of of of a live action. Now,

691
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,159
that's only one problem. That's not the

692
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,559
you go into more details about the kinds

693
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,880
of things that you can do to prevent it

694
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,320
escalating into actual combat. Combat is

695
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,880
one of those things that

696
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,679
>> and the idea is basically to do you know

697
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,080
your best to not end up at that

698
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,000
particular extreme of of a direct kind

699
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,520
of combat which is not uh uh you know so

700
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
ideally you don't have to go there and

701
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,960
as I said in 15 years I've been

702
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,279
assaulted once I'm sure I was lucky uh

703
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,720
people see think that my eyebrows are

704
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,080
intimidating so

705
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,840
don't uh you know tend to to get very

706
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,240
you know, friendly and and and and

707
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,600
again, I'm going to, you know, sell a

708
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,039
few, you know, tell you about a few

709
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,520
pearls and a few tricks that I I

710
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,120
personally use. It may not be, you know,

711
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,760
they may not be helpful for for

712
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,720
everybody over time. You develop your

713
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,120
own style. The idea is to to uh be able

714
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,200
to make an assessment and try to take

715
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,200
preventative steps. And I think that

716
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,039
that's the secret. And this is what I

717
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,360
hope, you know, better training, maybe

718
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,320
the use of simulation and and kind of

719
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,679
gaming could be could be helpful. Okay.

720
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:26,000
So, uh now I'm going to just uh you know

721
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,120
I'm going to jump into uh uh talking

722
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,559
about prevention and uh uh I not

723
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,960
prevention but identifying how you

724
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,000
assess and how you think about the

725
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,159
potential for violence and uh and these

726
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,720
are some some known uh um risk factors

727
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:47,120
for aggression. Obviously the history of

728
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:50,399
violence uh is is the top um how recent

729
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,679
how frequently uh you know those people

730
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,320
become uh assaulted what's the pattern

731
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,159
of escalation what are the associated

732
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,200
symptoms what happens when before

733
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,520
somebody gets uh becomes assaulted. Why

734
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,440
is this important? because you can you

735
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,200
can do and at all you should do quickly

736
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,440
before you know engaging with the

737
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,320
patient uh an assessment at that level

738
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,000
and it will help you uh figure out how

739
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,720
deep to get involved how likely you are

740
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,880
to gasolate the patient versus saying oh

741
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,679
I don't need this I need help let's go

742
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,799
in as a team you know so uh so that that

743
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,720
makes it important uh people often talk

744
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,880
about violent threats and fantasies

745
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,000
young people uh tend to be more

746
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,679
assaulted and there's no surprise also

747
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,320
older people who have uh uh dementia uh

748
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,200
and get uh more disinhibited and more

749
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,799
likely to become reactive. Uh I always

750
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,039
like to tell the story of a patient with

751
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,279
dementia. I was moonlighting and he

752
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,720
swung at me as I was passing and then I

753
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,679
went to talk to him. So what happened?

754
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,679
Well, I don't know. He just passed by me

755
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,000
and I was upset and he was the closest.

756
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:01,120
So I thought I would try to talk. Uh so

757
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,880
um there was no way for me to to predict

758
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,919
that it wasn't a serious thing. It

759
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,919
wasn't the predatory type of of uh of

760
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,919
assaultiveness where somebody plants you

761
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,000
know you know doesn't like you goes

762
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,320
after you

763
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,279
colleague of mine was attacked by a

764
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,200
patient patient watched when people were

765
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,480
not around

766
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,799
went into the doctor's room locked the

767
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,600
door and started contacting. So that's a

768
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,320
totally different animal. Uh so the

769
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,000
distinction between impulsive, affective

770
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,159
when you want or uh you know type of

771
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,679
aggression and the predatory you know is

772
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:44,080
essential to um

773
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,600
in some uh subcultures violence is is uh

774
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,960
is not allowed certainly much more much

775
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,000
more frequent. Um people uh of a lower

776
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,640
socioeconomic status uh may may be more

777
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,640
likely to become uh assaulted. Patients

778
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,279
of a limited cognitive ability

779
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,679
especially when institutionalized may be

780
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,919
more likely to to become assaulted and

781
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,159
then it's a uh many many diagnosis

782
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,240
uh increase the likelihood of assault.

783
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,159
Uh the top are psychotic disorders like

784
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,720
schizophrenia. Uh mood disorders like

785
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,880
bipolar uh I told you about what uh we

786
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,799
call cognitive disorders especially

787
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,440
dementia and confusional states. um

788
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,919
patients that have had traumatic brain

789
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,840
injuries or that have have you know have

790
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,279
epilepsy may be more likely a real

791
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,679
problem with Iraq veterans coming back

792
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,320
or rack or Afghanistan veterans when

793
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,480
they have had an IED explode under their

794
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,240
vehicle and they've had a brain injury

795
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,679
and now they have a lot of just

796
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,200
admission about violence and they can

797
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:54,480
just go off sometimes very unexpectedly.

798
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,200
The frontal lobe exerts an inhibitory uh

799
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,200
influence on our ability to uh to

800
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,760
function and that allows us to plan to

801
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,720
think ahead to sequence events. Often

802
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,799
when uh the exe this is the executive

803
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,039
function of of our frontal lobe when

804
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,120
he's impaired either you know in a

805
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,440
trauma or after surgery you know or uh

806
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,399
being in a in an accident or becoming

807
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,120
demented that ability to

808
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,840
uh to operate in that fashion maybe

809
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,919
violence is a is a possible uh side

810
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,399
effect. Substance abuse I think are are

811
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,640
the top of the list. Uh because of the

812
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,320
disinhibition both during the

813
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,799
intoxication phase and during the

814
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,159
withdrawal phase people tends to become

815
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:42,559
very agitated and assaulted. There are

816
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:45,200
certain personality disorders. Uh so uh

817
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,799
when uh when we think as about a

818
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,039
personality disorder we have this

819
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,679
enduring maladaptive patterns of of

820
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,840
relating to you know to the to you and

821
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,279
to others and to the world.

822
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,279
You know the obsessive compulsive

823
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,279
personality disorder likes to have

824
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,600
things organized, planned, nothing. Even

825
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,960
going on vacation is an exhausting task.

826
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,720
Nothing has to happen randomly.

827
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,879
Uh grandio personalities really need

828
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,599
this kind of feeding coming from from

829
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,560
all directions. Uh they they need to be

830
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,800
in the limelight. they they use people

831
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,560
not as good people but as people that

832
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,440
kind of uh provide sustenance their own

833
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,359
self-esteem. two uh two type of uh

834
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,560
personality disorders uh are

835
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,240
particularly likely to uh promote

836
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,399
violence. Uh the antisocial

837
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,879
uh and you may have heard the term

838
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,839
borderline personality disorder which is

839
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,879
basically uh at core has uh significant

840
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:49,599
instability in emotions in interpersonal

841
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,760
relationships and identity and uh

842
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,159
basically their lives are are a mess.

843
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,639
often they feel abandoned, they feel put

844
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,760
down, they uh they may get briefly

845
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,000
paranoid and often uh they make they

846
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,480
become assaulted. So again I'm throwing

847
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,720
a lot of uh a lot of terms and

848
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,760
definitions at you. I don't want to you

849
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,520
know make this u lecture about

850
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,000
psychiatry but these are conditions that

851
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,640
I think u are helpful uh to think about.

852
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,079
Yeah.

853
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,720
>> People with delusional disorders like

854
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,920
schizophrenia get violent. Is it usually

855
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,359
because they're frustrated about

856
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,119
something or is it because they suddenly

857
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,079
have some sort of delusion about their

858
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,640
their clinician that involves uh great

859
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,560
question,

860
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,400
>> you know, requiring them to to take some

861
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,560
sort of action that is violent?

862
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,800
>> I think both. I think even people that

863
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,640
have a psychotic disorder have the right

864
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,920
to, you know, feel the victim of an

865
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,680
injustice or feel frustrated or u many

866
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,440
of the reasons that I I I talked about

867
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,880
could could happen. But in particular uh

868
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,680
I think the other point is equally

869
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,240
important that they may act on a on a

870
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,240
delusional delusional conviction or

871
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:01,760
their psychosis may also have uh may may

872
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,359
have hallucinations and uh command

873
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,200
auditor hallucinations uh are known to

874
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,160
often be the forers of the violent

875
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,240
attack. You talk about me and say things

876
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,200
you know or the voice tells me I'm going

877
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:20,160
to go after you. uh you do it and the

878
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,880
person feels uh uh uh hopeless to uh uh

879
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,119
to resist that. I discharge the patient

880
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,160
who's doing great. Next day he comes

881
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,520
back, went home. The boys told him that

882
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,160
he needs to uh hurt his mother otherwise

883
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,400
he will get disembowled. So he started

884
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,640
punching her and then chased her with a

885
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,640
with a knife. She had to hide in you

886
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,079
know behind you know in in the

887
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,640
neighbor's house until the police

888
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,680
arrived. Uh there is an interesting

889
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,560
threat control override pair that that

890
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,680
people have looked at violence u have

891
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,640
described as uh being sometimes the

892
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,760
proximal uh cause for violence. People

893
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,640
feel directly threatened uh and they

894
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,720
also uh have this overpowering you know

895
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,040
urge that they need to act on that

896
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,240
cannot resist. It's a controversial

897
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
concept. But I'm not for sure why I

898
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,920
would give it give this particular

899
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,480
association a a higher status than than

900
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,560
other convictions about the neighbors,

901
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,560
you know, watching me and uh and or

902
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,040
planning to kill me or putting together

903
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,320
a variety of clues that my friends are

904
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,160
really trying to to to get rid of me and

905
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,760
then I need to protect myself. But but

906
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,920
you're absolutely right. What's

907
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,359
interesting, even though patients with

908
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,960
chronic psychotic disorders may have

909
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,040
their reasons to um to become assaulted

910
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,440
in the overall bigger scheme of things,

911
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,000
when you look at actual uh violent

912
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,480
assaults committed in in society,

913
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,480
they're responsible for a tiny one. So,

914
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,240
it's it's an interesting way of looking

915
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,480
at numbers. Yes, they could uh

916
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,240
become violent, but the reality is that

917
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,880
the their numbers, you know, in terms of

918
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,240
the actual violent acts very small. But

919
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,960
anyway, this may just be a kind of

920
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,040
statistical uh trick.

921
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,240
>> You're talking about the number of cases

922
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,280
of violent episodes where compared to

923
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
the general population.

924
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,480
>> Exactly. Okay. So,

925
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,640
>> exactly. That's that's exactly the point

926
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,440
I'm trying to make. And then there are

927
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,760
uh various acute findings when you

928
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,200
examine the patient on on what what we

929
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
call the mental status examination.

930
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,680
Obviously, hostility, suspiciousness,

931
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,000
agitation are all associated with uh

932
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,160
with violence.

933
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,160
In terms of uh uh one one I want just to

934
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,359
focus one minute on on the so-called

935
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:46,560
aggressive attributional style. Um how

936
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:49,440
do we uh uh respond to stress in when we

937
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,079
have the per perception of uh uh of

938
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,640
threat? Um

939
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,400
this is the uh um threat override uh

940
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,000
delusion that I mentioned but I think

941
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,960
that's that's probably relevant and

942
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,720
command explanations

943
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,040
what happens in conditions of

944
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,320
uncertainty and many of the patients or

945
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,880
people may have to think in a distorted

946
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,920
fashion. I was talking at the beginning

947
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,440
about uh um

948
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,200
the uh communication breakdown.

949
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,280
You have the layer of the mental illness

950
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,599
that that shrinks your options. You have

951
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,839
a particular situation to deal with uh

952
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,960
that makes you even more likely to

953
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,200
become uh uh uh to become assaulted. And

954
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,119
and this constellation of cognitive

955
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,280
distortions may make you more likely for

956
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,200
you to uh to become assaulted.

957
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,839
neglecting the base information which

958
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,320
kind of assigns a high weight to to

959
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:48,000
certain events that otherwise uh you

960
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,839
know are you know are low frequency uh

961
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,800
attending uh only to facts that would

962
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,359
confirm your assumptions I think. Go

963
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,000
ahead.

964
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,960
>> Oh okay. So if uh the psychiatrist's

965
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,560
office calls to reschedule appointment

966
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,320
the person assumes that this is because

967
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,000
the psychiatrist doesn't like him.

968
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,520
>> Exactly. this guy, this this person

969
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,720
doesn't want to treat me. They don't

970
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,520
like me. They don't want me to be their

971
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,839
patient because they rescheduled me.

972
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,119
>> Ignoring facts that could disisconfirm

973
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,680
your hypothesis. Um, I just talked to

974
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,920
the psychiatrist who who was nice to me,

975
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,160
but still the fact that that he called

976
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,839
and canceled is the overriding, you

977
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,280
know, explanation that he doesn't like

978
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,800
me. or focusing on on common events just

979
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,320
because you remember them, which is an

980
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,160
interesting way of explaining the fact

981
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,280
that you remember them kind of brings

982
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,520
them up in the in the rank. Uh, and

983
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,920
other disisconfirming evidence is

984
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,520
totally kind of ignored. It's like the

985
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,440
assumption that the train on the other

986
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,119
platform always always seems to arrive

987
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,359
first because those are the ones you

988
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,160
remember or kind of the garden ride with

989
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,160
grass is always

990
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,920
uh and I talked about uh about

991
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,920
medication and street drugs some are

992
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,000
more likely to be associated alcohol

993
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,800
just by the sheer volume and especially

994
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,720
because withdrawal is so violent uh you

995
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,040
know it's it's a significant issue the

996
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,359
intoxication phase your level of

997
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,920
coordination you know your perception of

998
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,599
facts. You know, it's it's just uh

999
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,599
they're so off that you're more likely

1000
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,400
to to lose control. Uh anti-depressants

1001
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,000
um have an interesting impact because in

1002
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,160
people that have an underlying tendency

1003
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,160
to swing in their moods may actually

1004
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,359
augment those things. You may have heard

1005
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,280
of of the of the news of

1006
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,640
anti-depressants promoting violence and

1007
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,160
suicide in adolescence. Uh and while

1008
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,640
statistitians are still scratching their

1009
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,440
heads to figure out the exact numbers uh

1010
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,280
the truth is that mood is very unstable

1011
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,520
in in adolescence uh and uh often

1012
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,359
initial depression may turn out to be

1013
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,520
something else. You give somebody an

1014
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,680
interdepressant call him or her for

1015
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,680
followup in six or eight months in

1016
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,680
meanwhile lots of things happen. And I

1017
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,760
think in those cases when actually uh

1018
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,319
those young

1019
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,240
adolescents committed suicide, it was

1020
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,160
not so much about anti-depressant

1021
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,760
causing it. Probably the depressants

1022
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,319
made the symptoms worse. It was very

1023
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,040
poor followup and and poor diagnostic.

1024
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,839
But anyway, this is getting too too

1025
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,520
technical. Uh I included this in the

1026
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,319
last minute. This is an interesting

1027
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,240
summary of of a nationwide uh study uh

1028
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,960
focusing on violence violence risk

1029
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,920
assessment. Um

1030
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,720
let me um just say two minutes about

1031
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,200
useful measures in assessing dynamic

1032
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,240
violence. Um people have looked at

1033
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,319
violence uh in two ways. They have put

1034
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,920
together all those factors that I that I

1035
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,520
presented initially and uh uh they have

1036
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,920
looked at retrospectively that those

1037
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,040
would become violent and they compiled

1038
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,280
um the history clinical risk assessment

1039
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,520
scale. The problem is that when you're

1040
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,599
dealing with somebody those scales even

1041
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,400
though they may give you a good image of

1042
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,000
what happens in the long run uh they may

1043
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,640
not help you deal with the immediate

1044
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
situation. So clinical scales have have

1045
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,160
been used in IL you know one developed

1046
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,319
in Norway uh the other one the dynamic

1047
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,359
appraisal developed in Australia. This

1048
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:24,160
these are the items for the HCR20

1049
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,920
uh and it's almost like a repetition of

1050
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,079
what I said earlier in terms of risk

1051
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,079
factors. This is the historical risk

1052
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,240
factors and these are validated skills

1053
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,240
that have been used for for more than 15

1054
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:39,200
years. The clinical scale uh is the the

1055
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,960
dynamic part of the HCR. Uh and then the

1056
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,040
risk management scale is trying to

1057
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,920
project in the future what do you have

1058
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,760
to do in order to uh ensure safety what

1059
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,760
could go wrong and and

1060
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,599
>> so so the value of these scales is kind

1061
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,560
of sizing up the likelihood of this

1062
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,079
person becoming violent um in the

1063
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,839
absence of other information. Now the

1064
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,280
best predictor is probably what they're

1065
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,359
actually doing behaviorally in front of

1066
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,920
you. you know, they're reaching for for

1067
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,520
something heavy, you know, that's, you

1068
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,920
know, I take that into, you know, weigh

1069
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,200
that heavily. But, um, but in the

1070
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,359
absence of anything else, you know, that

1071
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,960
the people who meet a certain, I guess

1072
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,520
you could say, certain profile are more

1073
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,280
likely to be violent and as a

1074
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,280
psychiatric patient than others.

1075
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,359
>> This is a dynamic scale that looks at

1076
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,319
what happens in front of you. As you

1077
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,400
pointed out, u, you're considering

1078
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,480
confusion, irritability, how boisterous

1079
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,640
and how verbally threatening the person

1080
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,560
is. uh the most recent one is the

1081
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,880
dynamic appraisal of the situational

1082
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,319
aggression that has seven factors that

1083
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,480
seems to be the best uh one assessment

1084
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:45,200
or uh prediction of violence over the

1085
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:49,200
over the next 24 hours. Uh and uh this

1086
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,400
is an interesting psychopathy uh kind of

1087
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,440
index. Psychopathy uh is uh has an

1088
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,160
interesting history. I think the the the

1089
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,400
current uh version that we will talk

1090
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,280
about is the antisocial personality. Uh

1091
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,720
but basically refers to people with uh

1092
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,960
with minimal capacity for empathy uh

1093
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,079
whose kind of moral dimension is fairly

1094
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,880
fairly primitive who engage in stealing,

1095
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,800
cheating, violence and don't have a lot

1096
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,800
of kind of uh moral drawbacks to do it.

1097
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Uh it seems to be associated with

1098
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,079
violence not surprisingly. And this is

1099
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,640
actually a factor analysis that you know

1100
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,359
identifies those two uh those two

1101
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,839
dimensions. Um now just at the end I

1102
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:39,760
want to talk about uh uh the

1103
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,440
deescalation principles uh that I

1104
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,680
actually I'm trying to incorporate in

1105
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:50,000
standardized patients u because the

1106
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,240
these should be uh fairly easy to to uh

1107
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,800
at least present and then maybe

1108
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,119
hopefully to to teach the residents how

1109
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,240
to use uh in terms of dealing with

1110
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,800
educated patients. So, and actually many

1111
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,480
of many of them are are are used by by

1112
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,200
staff u how to how to start the

1113
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,079
interaction with a um with a violent

1114
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:16,000
patient, how to position yourself within

1115
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:19,920
kind of arms length uh uh probably at 45

1116
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,520
degrees u for two reasons.

1117
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,400
uh one to uh um if in case you're

1118
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,560
attacked to offer a much smaller surface

1119
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,319
uh of the impact and also to allow you a

1120
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,079
way to escape if you have to. Um not

1121
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,680
obviously to block the exit or stand

1122
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,319
over if the person is kind of kneeling

1123
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,760
down or or in the bed. Never turn your

1124
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,079
back. Uh what to do with your hands?

1125
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,480
Never make fists or kind of keep your

1126
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:51,119
arms crossed or behind you or in your

1127
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,520
pockets uh to kind of appear as uh um as

1128
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,240
non-threatening as possible. How to

1129
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,240
regulate the the eye contact? If it's

1130
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,880
too intense, it can become bothersome.

1131
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,119
If it if it lacks completely, then

1132
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,160
people could uh conclude that you're not

1133
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,160
really interested or involved. Um

1134
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,800
>> the thing that that's um important to

1135
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,200
keep in mind with a um psychiatric

1136
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,640
patient is well, a couple things. One is

1137
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,920
that mental health uh patients are much

1138
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,200
more likely to be the victims of

1139
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,560
violence than actually to commit

1140
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,480
violence. And this is, you know, that's

1141
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,720
really the outlier, the unusual case

1142
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,400
where the psychiatric patient becomes

1143
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,160
violent. But obviously, it's an

1144
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,160
important situation. It does happen

1145
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,000
frequently enough to be a real concern

1146
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:37,040
for the the providers for their

1147
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,280
well-being. Um but then um

1148
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,640
the I think I've lost lost my train of

1149
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,000
thought here and basically there's

1150
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,680
there's different levels of what you

1151
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,839
have to understand how to do. One, how

1152
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,760
to protect yourself and then two, how to

1153
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,880
protect the patient. It's almost like if

1154
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,960
your child who's 11 years old comes at

1155
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,240
you swinging, it's really different than

1156
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,160
if you're getting bugged on the subway

1157
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,760
in terms of what you're going to do.

1158
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,960
Now, the person who's sitting in your

1159
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,240
office might be a lot bigger than your

1160
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,240
11-year-old, but you kind of get the

1161
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,119
idea. You're not you're not trying to

1162
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,920
punish them. You're not trying to uh you

1163
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,520
know inflict any more harm on them than

1164
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,119
is absolutely needed in order to stop

1165
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,680
the situation and for you know you to

1166
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,280
get out or let them out.

1167
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,240
>> Yes. And and that's important and that's

1168
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,880
somewhat counterintuitive because when

1169
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,319
uh I think an interesting aspect I'm

1170
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,680
just thinking or trying to think in

1171
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,960
terms of potential simulation uh and and

1172
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:32,160
targets for for a training uh paradigm.

1173
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,359
I think an important aspect is to uh uh

1174
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,880
for the person who's going through the

1175
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,359
training to understand himself or

1176
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,160
herself. How what's the reaction when

1177
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,079
you're threatened and how to uh to

1178
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,000
continue to think on your feet and and

1179
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,240
take decisions that are not based on a

1180
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,200
kind of flight or fight or tendon

1181
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,680
befriend you know attitude. Uh this is

1182
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,079
not about dealing with with a common

1183
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,640
situation. This is uh when you have to

1184
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,720
maintain your ability to uh to remain

1185
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,880
therapeutic and helpful and to minimize

1186
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,800
harm to yourself but certainly harm to

1187
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,040
to the other person. And the truth of

1188
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,760
the matter is that many people in this

1189
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,920
situations react the way they have that

1190
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,680
they have always done. I mean, I I I

1191
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,800
gave Jim the example of a social worker

1192
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,800
I work with who every time when she's

1193
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,240
confronted by

1194
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:24,400
a patient. She gets angry and and she

1195
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,880
gets defensive and and tells things, you

1196
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,880
know, to her that I find are are hurtful

1197
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,720
and are just kind of, you know, adding

1198
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,760
gas to the fire. I need to intervene

1199
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,079
between the two of them. It's almost

1200
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,559
like uh, you know, I'm there the umpire.

1201
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,200
I say, "Okay, time out. Stop. We need to

1202
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,520
do something else." And I I I try to

1203
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,359
explain to her, she just doesn't uh

1204
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,000
doesn't get it or you know can't

1205
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:48,480
theoretically figure it out but uh you

1206
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,319
know doesn't uh doesn't do a good job at

1207
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,880
it. When we are angry or frightened our

1208
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,359
behavior, our the way we talk, the way

1209
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,319
we track changes and that can those

1210
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,599
things can uh be major triggers for for

1211
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,599
the other person. So

1212
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,760
>> yeah, if you're if you're s stay really

1213
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,680
calm and the other person's escalating,

1214
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,920
that's a real dampening force on that

1215
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,640
other person from escalating even more.

1216
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,400
And it's really really hard to do

1217
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,200
that. Stay professional and recognizing

1218
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,720
that this this aggression is a really a

1219
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,520
medical symptom just like if there were

1220
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,720
bleeding on the floor that you know the

1221
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,640
difference obviously is that it could

1222
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,000
actually hurt you the provider. But you

1223
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,119
know you need to to recognize as a

1224
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,960
medical symptom that needs to be dealt

1225
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,960
with as opposed to taking it really

1226
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,319
personally or or you know getting

1227
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,880
violent act.

1228
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,319
>> Yes. Uh

1229
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,480
how do you hear? How do you uh uh

1230
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,559
obviously being calm, centered, self-

1231
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,079
assured is always helpful. It's it's the

1232
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,839
message that that you're you're you're

1233
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,640
conveying. often uh if you respond you

1234
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,640
know to anger by being fearful or anger

1235
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,160
yourself you know obviously this will

1236
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,559
just kind of escalate uh or if you're

1237
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,960
fidgety and you know pacing and

1238
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,119
gesturing yourself and and wondering so

1239
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,440
what do I do now I think uh the other

1240
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,440
person will clearly pick up that that

1241
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,359
feeling uh touching

1242
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,280
uh most often than not is not a good

1243
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,800
idea even though I mean instinctively we

1244
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,960
would like to kind of calm calm the

1245
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,280
other person down or wonder what it is.

1246
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,359
This is how we learn to show kind of

1247
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,000
empathy and that we care, we want to

1248
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:27,119
help. Well, it may not may not be a may

1249
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
not be a good idea.

1250
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,599
So, uh and then

1251
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,400
this could be a topic in itself. Um

1252
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,040
active listening would be uh the most uh

1253
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,079
u if you want the buzzword in terms of

1254
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,599
the verbal deescalation uh principle.

1255
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:47,040
often when I uh when I'm called and many

1256
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,200
of my colleagues are called to deal with

1257
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,200
such a situation I introduce myself I uh

1258
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,480
I'm telling the person no matter how

1259
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,040
agitated he is why I'm here uh and I'm

1260
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,280
trying to understand uh I may not

1261
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,359
respond or react to you know the

1262
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,119
person's curses or threatening behavior

1263
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,839
of course I try to maintain a safe

1264
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,079
distance and I continue my assessment I

1265
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:12,480
can I deal with this or I need help or I

1266
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,319
I need to stop and and and find another

1267
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:20,640
way. Uh and I give that person feedback

1268
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:22,559
about uh what I see, how he or she makes

1269
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,319
me feel. I feel, you know, you're

1270
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,760
threatening. I feel uncomfortable. I

1271
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:29,200
think we need to stop. Do you want to

1272
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:33,760
talk? What are the issues uh that that

1273
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:37,040
you're dealing with? And um I also

1274
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,680
explain uh and set limits on on what is

1275
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:44,440
acceptable and not acceptable. often

1276
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,440
that combination works. Um

1277
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,040
I listed phacotherapy and seclusion is

1278
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,160
trained because they're part of the

1279
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,640
process and I think uh I would like u

1280
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,559
people you know who are trained you know

1281
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:01,319
uh for this to understand that those

1282
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,319
things are available. Um,

1283
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,520
any questions so far?

1284
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,680
>> I I've just got a couple of comments on

1285
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:17,760
the position of the table. So,

1286
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,359
>> yeah, we can do that. And also, I wanted

1287
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,119
to suggest see what you think about

1288
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,680
this. If someone would like to play the

1289
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,040
role of a patient, I can meet with you

1290
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,880
briefly and just kind of prepare you to

1291
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,960
do that. If anybody's interested in

1292
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,720
taking on the role of the aggressive

1293
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,480
you'd like to do. Okay. So, why don't

1294
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:36,800
you and I step up for just a couple

1295
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,079
minutes and then you're talking.

1296
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,079
>> So, that's going to be a bit of a role

1297
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:45,520
play demonstration.

1298
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,559
>> No, that's okay. So, uh, so I mean

1299
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,400
there's a couple of things that that

1300
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,920
that that have been brought up that

1301
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,079
already immediately seem to be possible

1302
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,400
places where you guys can think of what

1303
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,520
what you're going to do your project on.

1304
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,359
Um that's that's uh that's identifying

1305
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,119
factors of course that I mean there's a

1306
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:06,240
whole bunch of different schemes that

1307
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,640
you that that that and different u

1308
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,359
metrics that that people have been using

1309
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:14,480
uh all the way from from known

1310
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,400
personality types to you know to social

1311
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,160
economic factors and and personal

1312
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,920
history. you can make some some some

1313
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,839
kind of kernel of war game, you know, I

1314
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,559
can imagine some some sort of like can

1315
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,839
you figure out enough information before

1316
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,880
it's too late, that sort of kind of

1317
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,960
thing. Um, the dynamic assessment of

1318
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,960
violence seems to be more of a time

1319
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,960
pressure kind of thing because it's like

1320
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,319
you almost have to like figure it out on

1321
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,119
the spot, right? But the factors are

1322
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,520
very different. But I thought it's like

1323
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,040
identifying um activists. The the

1324
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,680
deescalation

1325
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,200
um the active listening thing is kind of

1326
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,000
interesting because it almost seems like

1327
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,720
you could make it a word game or a face

1328
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,800
to face kind of party game kind of thing

1329
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:59,280
out of that of the can you remember what

1330
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,599
you're supposed to do with you know in

1331
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,319
conversation with each other without

1332
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,000
missing any of the any of the points and

1333
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,119
and that might be something that they

1334
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,559
could do. So that that would be like a

1335
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,000
live action game but not necessarily a

1336
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,440
physical game. It would be like you know

1337
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,200
like more like a party game you can

1338
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,960
imagine working.

1339
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,480
>> I mean one one way I uh I this is by the

1340
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,800
way I didn't want to go there to make

1341
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,440
this too long but this these are some

1342
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,880
parts of a standardized uh patient that

1343
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,440
I'm putting together. that I'm going to

1344
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,160
try actually to uh to talk to the

1345
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,240
simulation department at the mass to you

1346
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,200
know train an actor and this would be

1347
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:38,960
kind of the goals for uh you know the

1348
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,480
training modes um and I'm really

1349
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,480
particularly interested in how people

1350
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,280
respond when they're exposed to an angry

1351
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,280
situation or even to an angry face. What

1352
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,760
do you have to do in order to deescalate

1353
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,839
the patient? And what I'm what I what I

1354
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,599
think to you I'm going to suggest to the

1355
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:57,520
actor is that uh

1356
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,839
uh you are in the room and you're pacing

1357
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,680
up and down and you're very angry and

1358
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,280
you're allowed to use some generic swear

1359
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:08,240
words and uh uh and to have a number of

1360
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,440
complaints. Could be a number of them.

1361
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,680
Nurse was too late to give the

1362
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,040
medications. The girlfriend didn't come

1363
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:17,520
in time. Uh you owe money. you you just

1364
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,799
had a job interview today and you missed

1365
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,799
it because you're in the hospital. Could

1366
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:23,119
be a number of things. And then uh and

1367
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:27,680
then the person approaches approaches

1368
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:30,160
you. Uh the trainee should uh

1369
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:33,040
follow some rules in terms of the verbal

1370
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,839
and non-verbal deescalation. If that

1371
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:39,839
person is able to to engage you, you can

1372
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:44,000
become uh uh less angry, less agitated,

1373
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:47,040
more interested, uh face, they seem less

1374
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,680
uh uh lower your voice. If the trainee

1375
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,599
is just uh uh doing the right wrong

1376
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,760
things, you either stay at the same

1377
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,319
level or get more and more angry. Of

1378
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,640
course, it's fairly demanding for a uh

1379
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,760
for a for a standardized for an actor

1380
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,599
because the nonverbal elements are easy.

1381
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,280
How you regulate the distance, you know,

1382
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,760
how you look, how you approach, you

1383
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,000
know, you inhibit, you know, your

1384
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,760
natural tendency to kind of pat the

1385
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,680
person on the shoulder, whatever. But

1386
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,160
but the verbal aspects are more

1387
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,599
difficult.

1388
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,000
>> Improvising dialogue at the spot is

1389
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,400
hard.

1390
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,559
>> Exactly. But at the same time the goals

1391
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,680
of the dialogue are not

1392
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:26,160
>> u because you should probably find out

1393
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,640
what's going on even though let's say

1394
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,480
the the actor will try to tell you about

1395
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,119
his life and how miserable things are

1396
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,440
and you know uh I lost my job and you

1397
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,520
know I was kicked no but you need to try

1398
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,359
to bring the person to what really

1399
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,079
happened. I think that's very very

1400
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:44,559
helpful because you're you're pinning

1401
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:47,440
down a particular conflict that

1402
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:50,400
triggered it. uh uh and if you're able

1403
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,599
to do that then you can take some steps

1404
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:57,599
okay I I have a patient right now who

1405
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:59,520
has difficulty expressing herself and

1406
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,480
systematically there is one particular

1407
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,960
shift where the staff is not patient

1408
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,040
doesn't wait for her you just need to

1409
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,040
give her a little bit more time and she

1410
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,359
gets upset and and angry and starts

1411
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,359
facing and I have to every time say

1412
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,440
please listen to her or she comes up to

1413
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:17,760
me she tells me the story and then I go

1414
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,680
back to the staff. Okay, people just

1415
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,920
don't don't have the patience or don't

1416
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,119
care. Okay, so that's that's just a

1417
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,760
simple intervention. This is why you

1418
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,760
need to find out what's going on. Okay,

1419
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,359
and then if you can get more information

1420
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:33,200
about what brought the person to this

1421
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:36,720
place. Uh,

1422
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,880
okay. We prepared him and

1423
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,000
>> she did a role play before

1424
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,720
>> I showed this because this is a little

1425
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,359
bit.

1426
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,359
>> Yeah,

1427
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:44,960
>> you want to do it? You've been trained.

1428
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:46,799
>> No, no, no. You're you're the expert

1429
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,400
actually.

1430
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:53,400
>> Okay.

1431
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,400
All right. Let's see what happens to me.

1432
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,119
>> Hello.

1433
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:05,920
>> I'm uh I'm Dr. C.

1434
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:08,720
>> It's John. And I was John. I was born in

1435
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,160
oneonone with him. Why isn't he here?

1436
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,079
Why?

1437
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,400
>> Who Who's this person? I don't know.

1438
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,520
>> There's John. I only want to speak to

1439
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,240
him.

1440
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,319
>> Well, nurse Johnny is not not available.

1441
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,839
>> Why is he available? Why? Only only I

1442
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,839
can talk to.

1443
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,599
>> I don't want to talk to you right now.

1444
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,200
>> How can I help you?

1445
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:33,119
>> Get a job.

1446
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:35,200
>> Okay, I can try to see if he's around.

1447
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:40,960
>> Get right now.

1448
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:44,559
>> Okay, but what else can I do? Um,

1449
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,960
the medication stop not good. Try to

1450
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,280
poison all me dead.

1451
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,280
>> What does medication do?

1452
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,280
>> Desc.

1453
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,640
So tell me what what kind of problems do

1454
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:02,240
you have with medication?

1455
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,680
>> Kind of poison you owe me dead.

1456
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,440
>> So you don't think the medication is

1457
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:09,440
helpful?

1458
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,440
>> Of course not. You already killed me.

1459
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,200
What else can I do to help?

1460
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,200
>> Family. Family.

1461
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,079
>> You want me to contact the family?

1462
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,839
>> No. I hate them all. They're all against

1463
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,559
me.

1464
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:36,319
>> Must be very hard to not have anyone to

1465
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,839
talk to or feel comfortable with. That's

1466
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:44,079
why I want to have a chance.

1467
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:46,160
>> But I'm sorry you're struggling so much.

1468
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,839
>> And I know we haven't met before, but

1469
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,799
I'm here and trying to to be helpful to

1470
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,680
you.

1471
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:55,720
>> You want to kill me, don't you?

1472
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,720
>> No, I don't think I want to.

1473
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,799
So, we have a number of options.

1474
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,400
And I think you're you're looking angry

1475
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:15,760
and you're scaring people. Why?

1476
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,280
>> You're scaring me.

1477
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,520
>> Of course, you're just laughing behind

1478
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,200
me. You're not scared. Just laughing.

1479
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,359
>> No, I think you're you're a big strong

1480
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:26,240
guy and and when you get angry and

1481
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:29,599
upset, you can intimidate him. Uh, and

1482
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,960
there are other other way to push me

1483
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,520
>> scared me.

1484
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,280
>> Well, I'm not trying to hurt you. Uh,

1485
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,920
but we need to come up with a solution

1486
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,160
because you could get hurt and uh and

1487
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,440
other people could get hurt. So, we need

1488
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,280
to do something about that.

1489
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,160
>> Who would be better off? Dead. Everyone

1490
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,040
wants to be dead.

1491
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,440
>> Well, I understand you're you're quite

1492
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,920
destructive today

1493
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,200
and I want to help you. I may not be

1494
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,440
able to

1495
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,440
right away.

1496
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:09,400
I'm going to try to get the nourish that

1497
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,400
you want.

1498
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:16,559
But uh what if I cannot get what's the

1499
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:19,960
next best thing?

1500
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,960
>> I don't know.

1501
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,240
Would he help to uh uh contact your

1502
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,240
family?

1503
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,799
>> Okay, I can try to reach out to her.

1504
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,200
And uh do you think that if you change

1505
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:39,760
the medications, maybe you can uh try a

1506
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,520
combination that could be helpful?

1507
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,160
>> So, it's not poison.

1508
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,480
>> Okay, I hear you. You don't like the

1509
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:50,079
medication. You think it's uh it's

1510
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,680
hurting you, but it's helped in the past

1511
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:56,640
and maybe a different combination could

1512
01:02:51,680 --> 01:03:00,440
be more uh will be better.

1513
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,440
>> Maybe maybe

1514
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:11,520
thank you. We can do all this.

1515
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:15,240
[Applause]

1516
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,240
>> Oh, we have to put the fire.

1517
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,880
You want to hire him? Very

1518
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,640
good.

1519
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,760
>> Um

1520
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,680
uh I have a question actually about the

1521
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,920
uh the the disruption of narrative uh uh

1522
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,319
model of why violence occurs. Is that is

1523
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,480
that pretty much accepted as as like

1524
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:45,520
this this is the way you find

1525
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,640
>> I just made it up for this.

1526
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,359
I was just wondering if there are

1527
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,720
competing uh different theories might be

1528
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:53,359
useful for people to understand more

1529
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:57,280
than one model or is that pretty

1530
01:03:53,359 --> 01:04:00,480
the the narrative perspective is uh if

1531
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:03,280
you want a a cry from the past I think

1532
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,880
the last 20 years uh from science and

1533
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,680
certainly medicine have been dominated

1534
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,319
by by hard hard evidence

1535
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:12,319
>> actually uh uh the evidence-based

1536
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,799
medicine has been kind of taking over

1537
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:18,880
the entire world as as if you want the

1538
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:21,039
ultimate standard. So there are

1539
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,400
lists of the strength of the evidence

1540
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:28,480
and uh uh randomized

1541
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,319
control designs are are the best and

1542
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,079
clinical impression anecdotes are the

1543
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:38,079
worst. So in this on this map

1544
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:41,520
um the narrative or a personalized story

1545
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:45,280
about the patient uh may not may not be

1546
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,280
if you want the accepted uh model today

1547
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,480
but I think in dealing with individual

1548
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:52,240
cases I feel that makes a lot of sense

1549
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,039
when you have to deal with somebody

1550
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,680
who's very distraught

1551
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,839
>> if I tell him that the best available

1552
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:03,280
evidence was published two years ago and

1553
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:05,839
showed that you know 20 milligrams of

1554
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,640
Adilify would work best for psychosis.

1555
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:12,480
I'm not so sure that that you would you

1556
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,480
would feel the warm at the end of it,

1557
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,280
you know, but the reality it could be

1558
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,599
that that evidence is right. He's

1559
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,280
psychotic and he tried a very various

1560
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:24,079
medication. Some of them made him fat

1561
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,240
and pushed his triglycerides up and and

1562
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:29,039
raised his blood pressure. If I switch

1563
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,440
him to ailify and you know in two months

1564
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,359
he'll get better. But dealing with the

1565
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:37,680
immediate issue

1566
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:39,359
uh I think is just uh uh it's something

1567
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,039
else and and that knowledge about

1568
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,799
medication while while helpful in the

1569
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,119
long run would not make it very good. So

1570
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:47,119
this is why I kind came up with a if you

1571
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,319
want uh for the purpose of this meeting

1572
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:55,440
with a with a way of kind of creating a

1573
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:58,240
metaphor uh that could sustain my verbal

1574
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:02,559
and non-verbal if you want espiration

1575
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:05,280
I'm trying to uh to create some sense

1576
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:08,160
some coherence some meaning some meaning

1577
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,960
to to that interaction and in doing that

1578
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,920
I'm empathic and I'm trying to to

1579
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,920
channel theuh the energies in a way that

1580
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,599
uh that it's almost like a beginning.

1581
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,160
He's distraught. He's ready to give up.

1582
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:22,240
He's ready to to shut himself away from

1583
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,480
the world. I'm trying to reach out to

1584
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,559
him without becoming his friend, without

1585
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,839
becoming his brother or father. Uh but

1586
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,400
I'm trying to and I think in a sense I'm

1587
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:35,359
restoring the meaning of his narrative.

1588
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,520
>> Somebody cares, somebody reaches out.

1589
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,839
So because it seems like a very

1590
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,799
interesting system for people uh for

1591
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,799
designers to play with like the the the

1592
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,599
idea of trying even though there is this

1593
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:49,920
distorted narrative and you may uh you

1594
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,440
may not know enough about the narrative

1595
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,680
to be able to act on it but you can find

1596
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:57,039
out things about it by talking to the to

1597
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,359
to the patient and what you're really

1598
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,520
trying to do is make things fit within

1599
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:03,520
that person's narrative.

1600
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,039
you're filling the blanks that were kind

1601
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,280
of somewhat destroyed by

1602
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:09,280
>> by events and it could be variety of

1603
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,559
events

1604
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,839
>> and at times you have to use the

1605
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,760
imagination in a sense it's almost like

1606
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:15,599
the intuition I mean I know the

1607
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:19,119
principles in every case but how I'm

1608
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,799
going to do it it's it's not

1609
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,400
pre-programmed

1610
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,480
>> and it seems like that's that's that's

1611
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,720
also something that you could play with

1612
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,440
from a design point of view and this

1613
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,680
this idea of it's disrupted narrative

1614
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,359
and then how do to put it back. You

1615
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,799
know, the spec putting the pieces back

1616
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,760
together might be something that you can

1617
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,839
do.

1618
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,359
>> Um, that may be the reason, and that's

1619
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:42,559
not the speculation. I'm just making

1620
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:44,240
this up. Why why uh adventure games are

1621
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,760
are so powerful

1622
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,440
>> because in a sense, you're finding a

1623
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,680
substitute narrative

1624
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,240
>> uh that is much more controllable than

1625
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,960
your own.

1626
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,359
>> Yeah.

1627
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,760
>> Uh and for for the time of the game,

1628
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:57,920
you're you're you're there. It's almost

1629
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,559
like kind of you're buying a few

1630
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,760
minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes of of a

1631
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,680
different story line.

1632
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,520
>> Actually, one of our researchers, you

1633
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,280
look specifically at adventure games and

1634
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,599
and her point of view is that playing an

1635
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,839
adventure game is like being a performer

1636
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,520
who hasn't been given the script. Uh,

1637
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:15,440
you know, you're you're still an actor

1638
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,679
in the story and you have to figure out

1639
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,239
what that story is um in order to move

1640
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:22,239
along. So, so that that fits really

1641
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:24,319
well.

1642
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,799
Um there there's one other thing that I

1643
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,319
do want to bring up. Um obviously I

1644
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:30,000
don't want any of these games that you

1645
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,120
guys are working on to be quizzes to be

1646
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,640
like really fun quizzes even. Uh you

1647
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:38,960
know it's like no that's that's not what

1648
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,199
this class is about. I do want you guys

1649
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,799
to be designing games uh you know not

1650
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:45,199
just

1651
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:47,679
pursuit psych psychiatry version you

1652
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:50,319
know that that's that's kind of

1653
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,679
pointless. We we have had um games in

1654
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,520
the past in this class where people

1655
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,199
basically pulled questions out of a hat

1656
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,920
and had to answer them and there were

1657
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,839
like various penalties that were kind of

1658
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,960
fun but that's not what I've been

1659
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:05,359
teaching you guys. So so so try to think

1660
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,679
about systems try to think about um all

1661
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,759
these things that that they want uh

1662
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,279
their traineees to learn you know think

1663
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,159
about how they can engage with the

1664
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:17,759
system you know in some small way uh and

1665
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:21,520
and that's and that be a project.

1666
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:22,719
Great. Well, ask a question of u what

1667
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,640
are your thoughts or what are the field

1668
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:28,440
thoughts I guess on lying to people to

1669
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,440
like mitigate a situation?

1670
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:35,520
>> Well,

1671
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:40,159
um I would call lying a distortion. Uh

1672
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:41,920
and it's very uh in a genetical way. And

1673
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:44,159
uh

1674
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:48,000
when people lie, they they have to make

1675
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:50,799
a decision. Uh often People lie for a

1676
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,839
variety of reasons. What I always seem

1677
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:56,719
surprised by is the reason to to make

1678
01:09:53,839 --> 01:10:00,880
friends, to get friendly, to resolve a

1679
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:03,679
situation. Okay? And uh

1680
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:07,120
I don't believe in lying as as a as a

1681
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,760
communication tool. Uh even if it if it

1682
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:12,239
may make things easier in the short run,

1683
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:15,280
certainly clinically, it's not it's not

1684
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:17,760
it's not helpful. Uh I was telling you

1685
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,400
about patients with borderline pathology

1686
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,520
that have this affective and relational

1687
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:26,480
instability that is basically taking

1688
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,640
over their life. They are some of the

1689
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,560
most accurate lie detectors that you can

1690
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,159
imagine. You cannot design something

1691
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,600
more perfect than that, especially

1692
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,760
having been in the system for a long

1693
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,080
time. They can they can feel the light

1694
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:41,199
even before it comes up and then if

1695
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,679
you're going that path, you're dead.

1696
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:45,840
>> So this role play for example, if you

1697
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:47,840
told Bobby, "Well, let me go get John."

1698
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,760
on your way here for a minute and then

1699
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,440
you and you know that John isn't working

1700
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,199
right now. He's nowhere in the hospital,

1701
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,120
but you just told him that to so you can

1702
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,640
get out and then you get security to

1703
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,480
come back in with you and then we can

1704
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,440
subdue him or something. That's a great

1705
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:03,679
example. Uh and that happens all the

1706
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,159
time because often when you're in this

1707
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,679
place, many of your requests are

1708
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:11,120
unreasonable.

1709
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,800
Uh so you need to set some limits. Uh

1710
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,159
and eventually you'll end up setting

1711
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,080
some limits. he could have continued to

1712
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:18,400
escalate until kind of attacking me,

1713
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:21,840
breaking everything in the room. I

1714
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:24,800
usually tell them about uh how they make

1715
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,800
know others feel uh how unacceptable

1716
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,840
some of the behaviors are and what are

1717
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,600
the consequences. Okay. Uh so I'm I'm

1718
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,600
going to probably tell you if this

1719
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,600
continues I don't have any other choice

1720
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,600
but to call security and you end up in

1721
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,520
these strengths and with the chemical

1722
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,840
medication given to you injectable you

1723
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,000
could take it by mouth. So I'm coming up

1724
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,040
front with the with how the next few

1725
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,880
minutes the proximal future looks like

1726
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,199
as opposed to trying to kind of fudge it

1727
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,719
and kind of get on his friendly side and

1728
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:54,640
oh I don't mean anything but the

1729
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,840
security will put you in strength. You

1730
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:01,120
know what I mean? So I don't want to to

1731
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,400
buy him out by just becoming a friend if

1732
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:07,360
that involves lying. That's some people

1733
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,120
do it when you're in a corner. You're

1734
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:12,400
okay. So what do I do now? A little lie

1735
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,600
won't hurt any. Maybe it's just my my

1736
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,920
>> Yes. And what you just mentioned too,

1737
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,000
that sort of like good cop, bad cop.

1738
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,840
Well, you know, I wish we could have

1739
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,520
more conversation here, but security

1740
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,440
needs to put you in your security is the

1741
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,800
bad guy when you know that's exactly

1742
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,280
where you want the patient to be anyways

1743
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,280
because they're not

1744
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,199
>> I'm okay, but you know Jim, you know, he

1745
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,560
doesn't he's the director and he's going

1746
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,920
to, you know,

1747
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,000
>> so does that answer your question?

1748
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,360
>> Yeah. But I mean, would you like Yeah.

1749
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,880
Yeah. Would you

1750
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,480
>> I guess the followup is like would you

1751
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,880
ever seek you put medicine in someone's

1752
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:45,760
food or do something just

1753
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,960
>> it's not only uh you know a loss of

1754
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:52,320
waiting to happen

1755
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,360
of a of a major magnitude uh but I don't

1756
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,000
think it's right

1757
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:58,640
>> for me even though even though probably

1758
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,320
reality is that family members and

1759
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,560
sometimes even providers and nursing

1760
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,400
homes may uh may do that but I think

1761
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,480
it's a

1762
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,920
>> and you may you may need to treat the

1763
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,440
person against their will, which which

1764
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,960
is often meaning putting them into

1765
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,560
physical restraints, which is usually

1766
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,760
like lover kinds of things that can, you

1767
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,679
know, kind of a straight jacket thing or

1768
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,520
maybe to a bed and maybe physically

1769
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,440
inject them with something to really

1770
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,560
sedate them. But you should always be

1771
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,320
telling them what you're going to do,

1772
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,080
right? And and the reason why you're

1773
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,360
doing it even if they don't have any

1774
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,120
choices.

1775
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:31,520
>> And if you feel that the person is

1776
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:35,199
unable to to comprehend, you know, the

1777
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,880
then you may need to kind of work

1778
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:39,920
towards the being a guardian will take

1779
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,840
decisions for that person. So, and it's

1780
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,239
not necessarily that the legal field has

1781
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,560
pushed itself very hard in this field.

1782
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:48,400
But I think it's it's fair. Okay, you

1783
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,880
meet the person where the person is at

1784
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,800
and try to be helpful. And I think in my

1785
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,960
view, there's no substitute for being

1786
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,640
upfront and think what's going to

1787
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,120
happen. You may not he may not be my

1788
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,040
best friend, but he knows exactly. I'm

1789
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,800
telling the patients often ahead what's

1790
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,920
going to happen in the sense that I'm

1791
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:07,440
giving them choices. Uh so if I end up

1792
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,679
taking them to court for a commitment,

1793
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:12,080
they know that and they would be

1794
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,440
surprised. You would be surprised how

1795
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,280
you know how angry they are at the

1796
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,800
beginning and how okay they are later

1797
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,880
and how often they come up to me and

1798
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,960
said you know thank you. I was in a very

1799
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,320
bad place but you know and I know I

1800
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,320
didn't want to and I fought you all the

1801
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,760
way but I think that was the best

1802
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,480
solution for me and I don't necessarily

1803
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,480
do that to get that uh you know thanks.

1804
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,000
I just do it as a principle. This often

1805
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,080
doesn't come. So it's not like people

1806
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,600
are grateful. Often they leave the

1807
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,800
hospital

1808
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,560
you let me share a little bit of this uh

1809
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,920
um this change is just a few minutes.

1810
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,960
This is the project I'm I've been

1811
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:47,360
working on uh a lot for NASA which is

1812
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,800
basically to develop a mental health uh

1813
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,040
support system for the long duration

1814
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,640
space crews. And this was kind of a

1815
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,960
whole other topic, but just one piece of

1816
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:58,000
this was teaching the astronauts how to

1817
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:00,080
manage um conflict, interpersonal

1818
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,960
conflict more effectively

1819
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,320
for state.

1820
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,480
Astronauts being a very different

1821
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,280
population from who we're talking about.

1822
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,400
We don't have any sound.

1823
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:12,880
>> Oh, it's just probably turned down.

1824
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,600
Is it turned up on your computer?

1825
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,600
>> Um, let's just see.

1826
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,600
>> I just checked the muse.

1827
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:26,159
It's probably just turned on really.

1828
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:29,199
>> Oh, I'm sorry. It just turned off. Um,

1829
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:30,159
you can't go there and then I'll I'll

1830
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:33,159
adjust it.

1831
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,159
>> Okay.

1832
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,120
>> Should we be doing something at this

1833
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,840
point?

1834
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,840
>> Uh, not yet.

1835
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,960
Welcome to the virtual space station,

1836
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,960
where you can access training and

1837
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,360
resources to help deal with the stresses

1838
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,280
of long duration space flights. In the

1839
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,440
training simulator, you'll interact with

1840
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,280
virtual crew members to learn and

1841
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,280
practice managing some of the problems

1842
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,760
that might come up on longduration

1843
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,679
missions. The resources module has more

1844
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,760
advanced training that you can do to

1845
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,840
learn about adapting to the stresses of

1846
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,640
living in isolation, plus interviews

1847
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,880
with long duration flyers. It also has a

1848
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,960
number of ebooks and audio books on

1849
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,120
dealing with stress, plus survival

1850
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,360
stories about polar missions and other

1851
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,280
adventures. In the self- assessment

1852
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,080
module, you'll find questionnaires that

1853
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,840
can help. I'm going to

1854
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,000
>> skip out of this. Um, this is basically

1855
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,120
the whole the whole uh interface, but

1856
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,920
what I'll show you here is our

1857
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:34,000
simulator.

1858
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,920
This is the training simulator. Click on

1859
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,480
the topic you would like to learn about.

1860
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:41,280
Then the coach or mentor for that topic

1861
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,440
will take over and guide you through.

1862
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,159
>> This is the conflict management part of

1863
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:48,800
the simulator. We recommend that you do

1864
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:51,120
the 10-minute briefing first. After you

1865
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,280
complete each simulation,

1866
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,920
>> I am greenhouse, your conflict

1867
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,320
management coach. Here's how these

1868
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,840
simulations work. You are flight

1869
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:04,880
engineer one or F1 and your crewmate

1870
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,960
Chuck is flight engineer 2. We'll be

1871
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,600
giving you three choices of what to say

1872
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,159
or do. You can roll your mouse over them

1873
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,000
to hear how they're said, even though

1874
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,640
some options are more likely than others

1875
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,400
to reduce the conflict. I recommend that

1876
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,040
you try out options you might not choose

1877
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:23,280
in real life. That's because all paths

1878
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,000
in these simulations lead to teaching

1879
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,679
focus. You can click the backup button

1880
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,920
anytime if you want to change your

1881
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,920
choice and go down another pathway. You

1882
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:35,199
can click on the fair fighting manual at

1883
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,440
any time to read some tips. You'll also

1884
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:39,679
find this manual in the resource modules

1885
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,320
library. Now, as you go through the

1886
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:45,760
simulation, I'll be right here coaching

1887
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:47,679
you along the way. Okay, back to the

1888
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,600
simulation.

1889
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:52,000
It's 4 months into your mission with

1890
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,080
five and a half left to go. So far, the

1891
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,080
mission's been going pretty well. But

1892
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:59,719
you're both tired having had to sleep

1893
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,719
shift last night.

1894
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:09,920
>> Hey, is your display getting squirly?

1895
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,600
Shoot. Mine, too. Damn, I can systems

1896
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,880
down.

1897
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,719
That was the wrong cabling.

1898
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,960
And when I was installing the recorder,

1899
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:20,080
I disconnected the A10 cable. I mean, I

1900
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,159
fixed it right away, but I think it

1901
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,960
screwed up the whole system.

1902
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:28,600
Hey, look. If ground calls up, don't

1903
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,600
tell them about the cabling.

1904
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,000
Ah, this is a tricky situation. You

1905
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,400
believe it's important to tell the

1906
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,640
ground what happened. At the same time,

1907
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:41,440
you don't want Chuck to get in trouble.

1908
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,080
What's your response?

1909
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,440
>> So, here

1910
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,360
>> they'll spend hours trying to figure

1911
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,320
this out. We got to tell what's wrong

1912
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,679
with telling the ground.

1913
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,320
>> Okay, but you're putting me

1914
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,840
>> make a choice.

1915
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,520
>> Okay, you're putting me in a bad

1916
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,239
position.

1917
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:57,640
But thanks. You're a real friend. I read

1918
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,640
you big time.

1919
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:08,640
Yeah. Houston, this is FE2. Go ahead.

1920
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,920
Uh, no. Negative. I have no idea.

1921
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,960
Yeah, I know. Well, I already got the

1922
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,400
reboot started, right?

1923
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,280
I guess it's too early to say what the

1924
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:19,280
effect is.

1925
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:23,640
Roger that. I'll let you know if it

1926
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,640
happens again. two up.

1927
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:29,520
>> You're feeling very anxious having just

1928
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,360
heard Chuck lie to the ground. You're

1929
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,840
worried that this might backfire on you

1930
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,400
if the ground finds out that you knew

1931
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,320
what happened. This makes you very angry

1932
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,840
at Chuck. How would you like to respond?

1933
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,440
>> So, the reason I'm showing you guys this

1934
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,120
is that this is one one approach I've

1935
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,880
taken to to teaching how to how to

1936
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,320
handle an interaction with somebody

1937
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,080
through sort of a simulation. Now, this

1938
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,440
is obviously not a game. There's no

1939
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,560
score. There's no time limit. It's more

1940
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:56,880
of an interactive movie. Um, but with

1941
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,719
with the teaching points here, just just

1942
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,400
like what Caesar's giving you is, you

1943
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,400
know, we can give this to an astronaut

1944
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,320
um and they'll read it in 5 10 minutes

1945
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,600
and say, "Yep, got it. What's the next

1946
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,360
thing?" That doesn't mean they actually

1947
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,320
can use it. They remember it. They've

1948
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,600
absorbed it. So, and that I'm not saying

1949
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,280
that this is the way that you should do

1950
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,800
your games, but just that this is one

1951
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,719
approach that we've taken um

1952
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,640
to try to get them more involved with

1953
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,880
with the kind of material in more of a

1954
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,159
kind of a sim simulated way. We can just

1955
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,679
maybe do one or one or two of these.

1956
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:27,199
What would you like to do here?

1957
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,520
>> Chuck, we

1958
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:32,480
>> Chuck, we need to talk about this. I'm

1959
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,640
just to talk about it. Brown doesn't

1960
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:36,880
need to know every single little detail.

1961
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,760
All right. Plus, if we do tell them,

1962
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,120
next thing you know, we're going to be

1963
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,199
all over the news.

1964
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:43,679
>> This was a good choice. Even though

1965
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:46,159
Chuck seems exasperated, you know what's

1966
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,920
going on in his mind. Understanding what

1967
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:50,320
each other is thinking goes a long way

1968
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,320
to solving conflict. Chuck is concerned

1969
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:54,960
about the ruckus this might cause and

1970
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,960
about negative media attention. But now

1971
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,360
you have something to work with. What's

1972
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,360
your next move?

1973
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:06,159
>> Sure. I know you don't. You've been

1974
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,760
doing excellent work. So far, I can see

1975
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:12,239
you're really scared of them.

1976
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:14,080
>> I know you don't I know you don't want

1977
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,520
to draw a lot of attention, but what do

1978
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,080
you think will happen if they figure it

1979
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,080
out?

1980
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:21,280
>> Yeah. Okay, you got a point. I'd be fry,

1981
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,800
especially if it looked like I was

1982
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:26,560
trying to cover it up.

1983
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:30,600
You know,

1984
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,600
this really is a team issue.

1985
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,920
On the one hand, you seem to get chart

1986
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,600
to come around to your perspective that

1987
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,320
the ground really needs to know what

1988
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,400
happened. On the other hand, he's asking

1989
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:44,640
you to share the responsibility, even

1990
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,640
though it really wasn't your fault. You

1991
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,280
have mixed feelings. You don't want to

1992
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,880
be blamed for a mistake you didn't make,

1993
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,960
but you're concerned about keeping a

1994
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,320
good relationship with Chuck. How are

1995
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,800
you going to respond?

1996
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,480
>> Just do one more of these and wrap up.

1997
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:03,560
I'm sorry, Chuck, but this was your

1998
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:03,560
mistake to take responsibility for

1999
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:18,760
>> visible ground control.

2000
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,760
That's a good idea.

2001
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:26,560
>> Houston has too.

2002
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,159
Houston, I think we found a problem. The

2003
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,719
instructions you set up for the recorder

2004
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:32,560
had some serious problems. When you

2005
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,760
follow the recorder connect procedure,

2006
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:38,080
you can end up disconnecting A10. May

2007
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,320
need to be validated.

2008
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,080
>> Copy that, FB2. The procedure team ran

2009
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,480
through this in the mockup, but they can

2010
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:47,880
give it another look.

2011
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,880
In any organization,

2012
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:53,360
sometimes this can help to create a bond

2013
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:56,159
within the work group because everybody

2014
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:57,920
has a common enemy. But even though

2015
01:22:56,159 --> 01:23:00,159
scapegoating the ground may keep the

2016
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,320
crew unified for a while, this is

2017
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:04,480
serious cost.

2018
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,880
Obviously, a rift between space and

2019
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,920
ground,

2020
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,840
>> you kind of get the idea.

2021
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,159
>> We we'd like to be available by email in

2022
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,600
case you guys have any questions.

2023
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:16,000
Well, I'll I'll I'll I'll send our

2024
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,440
contact information to the fast list and

2025
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,719
um we're probably going to spend the

2026
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:22,320
rest of the week. So, uh so we're not

2027
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:26,000
quite sure exactly what we're working on

2028
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:29,760
yet, but you know, hopefully hopefully

2029
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,920
article uh on web

2030
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,000
and uh I just have a couple more admin

2031
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:37,480
to deal with. Uh, I want to thank you

2032
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,480
guys very well.

2033
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:44,080
[Applause]

2034
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,360
So, uh, let's see. On next Wednesday,

2035
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,080
which is the Wednesday right before

2036
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,440
Thanksgiving, um, I think a couple of

2037
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,520
folks are probably going to be like

2038
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:55,199
heading out for the

2039
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,719
>> Okay. Yeah. So, um, there because I've

2040
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,639
been hearing some like naffy stuff about

2041
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,400
like what the TSA might be doing and

2042
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:04,159
what people will be doing with in

2043
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:06,000
response to TSA. Uh yeah,

2044
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:07,840
>> getting to the air to the airport early

2045
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,400
if you're flying out might be a good

2046
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:13,199
idea. Um because if everybody decides to

2047
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,639
refuse the uh the back scatter scans and

2048
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,360
the body searches, then we're talking

2049
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:20,400
about some of the utilities. Anyway, um

2050
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:22,560
so I think what I'm going to do is

2051
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,080
actually call up once it's passed. Um

2052
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:28,320
and uh but if the people if there are

2053
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:30,159
teams who are really wanting to do a

2054
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,080
live action game and they want to sort

2055
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:34,320
of get a head start on that, talk to me

2056
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,159
directly and maybe what we can do is we

2057
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,880
can just sort of like uh meet up with

2058
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,639
you guys as a team and sort of come talk

2059
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:43,920
uh try to get some ideas across do like

2060
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:46,000
a brainstorming with with me. Um I will

2061
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,880
still get to talking about live action

2062
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,120
games um the following week. Uh uh I'll

2063
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,159
schedule uh one of the classes uh for

2064
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,480
that. So, we're not going to miss that

2065
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:56,239
topic uh at all. Just going to be I just

2066
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,679
worry that if we get to it too late and

2067
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,120
you're making a live action game, then

2068
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:02,560
you don't actually have enough material

2069
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:06,960
to work with. Um let's see. So, that's

2070
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:09,520
the class on Friday. And oh, and uh

2071
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,920
finally about this assignment, if it if

2072
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,120
if the subject matter, you know, is a

2073
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:16,239
little uncomfortable for you to work

2074
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:18,560
with and you know, and and and and you

2075
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:22,639
can't really find something that that uh

2076
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:24,000
in in this fairly large large uh top

2077
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,080
topic that you will be comfortable

2078
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,480
working with. You can't find a team. Uh

2079
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,239
again, talk to me directly and you know

2080
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,880
and and and we can work out some some

2081
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:34,560
some other assignment. I can't say that

2082
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,280
I have an assignment in my back pocket

2083
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:40,800
already to uh to go and more likely than

2084
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:43,679
not I'm halfassing it too.

2085
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,719
I would much prefer uh folks to to to

2086
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,880
work on this problem because I think

2087
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:49,199
it's fascinating and it and I think it's

2088
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,400
a pretty big problem that you can like

2089
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:54,880
find some small uh small parts but if

2090
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:56,239
you are I don't want to put anyone I I I

2091
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,639
don't want to make anyone uncomfortable

2092
01:25:56,239 --> 01:26:04,000
do their homework basically. So just

2093
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:06,960
talk to me and pick this up. Okay.

2094
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,960
>> Thank you. Please.
