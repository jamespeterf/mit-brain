1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,720
What do I wish candidates would ask me

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,040
when they're applying to MIT Sloan?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,440
It's tough to say, but I think that the

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,440
biggest thing is what do what are we

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,680
looking for, right? Exactly. How can

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,279
they stand out in the pool? The reality

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
is is that we're not looking for

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,359
something specific. There's not a magic

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,039
part of the application that's going to

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,880
make you stand out. It's you that's

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
going to make you stand out. We want to

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,400
get to know you as an applicant and you

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,399
need to showcase that throughout each of

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
the application components, being

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,480
thoughtful and careful with how you use

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
your examples throughout all of the

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,200
different cover letters, resumes,

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,160
videos. We cannot wait to get to know

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,360
you. The question is, do you belong at

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,280
MIT Sloan? The answer is yes, you belong

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,000
here. There is no one MIT Sloan student

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,399
that we're looking for. We intentionally

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,480
create this environment that has people

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
of all different backgrounds, lived

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,879
experiences that can bring their own

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,239
perspective to the classroom and to the

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,320
community. Whoever you are, whatever

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
your background is, you belong here and

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,240
we can't wait to meet you. A question I

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
wish applicants would ask more often is

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,320
which part of the application is often

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,720
overlooked by candidates?

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,640
Not only are we looking for evidence of

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,759
your success through the essay

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
questions, the letters of

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,000
recommendation, your transcripts, and

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,320
your resume, but there's also a lot of

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,040
hidden real estate in the application.

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,759
There's lots of short answer textbox

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,240
questions in the employment section, in

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
the academic history section, even in

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,799
the academics and awards section. So,

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,880
make sure you spend a little extra time

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,960
making sure that all of the things you

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,799
include in your application complement

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
one another, not just repeat one

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,119
another. I want you to know that this is

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
just the beginning of the admissions

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,439
process. The application provides you an

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
opportunity to really highlight your

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,079
strengths and experiences and how you

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,840
might contribute to this loan community.

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,560
The admissions committee will review all

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,880
applications and invite a selected group

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,799
of folks to interview with us. In an

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,800
interview, we have the opportunity to

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,879
dig deeper into the experiences that

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,239
you've highlighted in your application.

59
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,720
As we get to know you through the

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,400
application and interview processes, we

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
look forward to learning more about what

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,400
makes you you professionally and

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
personally.
