hanik for decades government and

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,320
Industry have looked at hydrogen as a

12
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,719
potentially game-changing tool pool in

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,120
the Quest for clean

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,879
the Clinton Administration energy sector

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,079
observers and public policy experts have

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,600
extoled the virtues of hydrogen to the

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,760
point that some people have joked that

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,520
hydrogen is the energy of the future and

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,480
always will be even as wind and solar

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,879
power have become commonplace in recent

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,399
years hydrogen has been held back by

23
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,359
high costs and other challenges but the

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,000

kilogram to produce and the hydrogen

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,879
shot stated goal is to bring that down

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,519
by 80% to $1 per kilogram within a

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,959
decade the hydrogen shot will be

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,360
facilitated by $9.5 billion in funding

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,000
for at least four clean hydrogen hubs

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
located in different parts of the United

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,120

infrastructure law still D noted that it

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
took more than 40 years for solar and

79
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,440
wind power to become cost competitive

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,400
and now industry government National Lab

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,840
and academic leaders are hoping to

82
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,720
achieve similar reductions in hydrogen

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,319
fuel costs over a much shorter time

84
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,920
frame in the near term she said

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,440
stakeholders will need to improve the

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,840
efficiency durability and affordability

87
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,120

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,959
water using today's renewable and

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,640
nuclear power sources over the long term

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,319
the focus May shift to splitting water

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,959
more directly through heat or solar

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,799
energy she said the time frame is short

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,599
the competition is intense and a

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,799
coordinated effort is critical for

96
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,439

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,720
also touched on EC equinor's efforts to

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,400
build a decarbonized energy Hub in the

132
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,479

140
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,720
acknowledg that the biggest challenge

141
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,639
facing potential hydrogen producers is

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,240
the current lack of viable business

143
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,240
models resolving that challenge requires

144
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,120
cross industry collaboration and

145
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,080
supportive policy Frameworks so that the

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,560
market for hydrogen can be built and

147
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,280
sustained over the long term she

148
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,120

external strategy and Communications

151
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
leader for da noted that the company

152
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,280
already produces hydrogen in multiple

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,240
ways for one dowo operates the world's

with hydrogen one of the byproducts of

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,440
the process also bear showed a slide of

159
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,680
the 1891 patent for the electrolysis of

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,240
brine water which also produces hydrogen

161
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,000
the compan still engages in this

162
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,759
practice but Dow does not have an

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,280
effective way of utilizing the resulting

164
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,319
hydrogen for their own fuel just take a

165
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,720
moment to think about that bear said

166
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
we've been talking about hydrogen

167
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,720
production and the cost of it and this

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,479
is basically free hydrogen and it's

169
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,960
still too much of a barrier to somewhat

170
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,759
recycle that and use it for ourselves

171
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,560
the environment is clearly changing and

172
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,319
we do have plans for that but I think

173
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,080
that kind of sets some of the challenges

174
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,240
that face industry here however bear

175
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,360
said hydrogen is expected to play a

176
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,919
significant role in Dow's future as the

177
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,080
company attempts to decarbonize by

178
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,360
2050 the company she said plans optimize

179
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,960
hydrogen allocation and production

180
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,400

183
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,000
hydrogen ready bar noted that hydrogen

184
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,120
fuel is not a Panacea but rather one

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
among many potential contributors as

186
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,000
industry attempts to reduce or eliminate

187
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,960
carbon emissions in the coming decades

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,800
hydrogen has an important role but it's

189
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,800
not the only answer she

190
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,720
said this is real

191
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,960
Colleen Wright is Vice President of

192
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,120
corporate strategy for constellation

193
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,720
which recently separated from Exelon

194
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,919
Corporation Exelon now owns the former

195
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,800
company's regulated utilities such as

196
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,080
Commonwealth Edison and Baltimore Gas

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,879
and Electric while constellation owns

198
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,639
the competitive generation and Supply

199
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,520
portions of the business wrri stressed

200
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,360
the advantages of nuclear power in

201
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,960
hydrogen production what she said

202
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,639
include Superior economics low barriers

203
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,599
implementation and scalability a quarter

204
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,960
of emissions in the world are currently

205
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:05,800
from hard to decarbonized sectors the

206
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,800
industrial sector steel making heavyduty

207
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,720
Transportation Aviation she said these

208
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,199
are really challenging decarbonization

209
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
sectors and as we continue to expand and

210
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,800
Electrify we're going to need more

211
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,759
Supply we're also going to need to

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,560
produce clean hydrogen using emissions

213
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,560
free Power the scale of nuclear power

214
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,319
plants is uniquely suited to be able to

215
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,560
scale hydrogen production rate added she

216
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,560
mentioned constellation 9M Point site in

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,560
New York state which received a doe

218
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,719
grant for a pilot program that will see

219
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,800
a proton exchange membrane PM

220
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,919
electrolyzer installed at the site we're

221
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,039
very excited to see hydrogen go from a

222
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,519
research and development conversation to

223
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,200
a commercial conversation she said we've

224
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,160
been calling it a little bit of a middle

225
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,920
school dance everybody is standing

226
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,680
around the circle waiting to see who is

227
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,640
willing to put something at stake but

228
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,600
this is real we're not dancing around

229
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,320
the edges there are a lot of people who

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,040
are big players who are willing to put

231
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,040
skin in the game today
