1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,799
so now let's talk about how a medical

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,839
doctor can make a diagnosis of

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,120
ulcerative colitis so first thing that

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,719
happens is uh your doctor takes your

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,960
medical history and does some blood work

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,760
then there's a colonoscopy which again

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,400
is just a tube that's inserted kind of

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,600
into the gastrointestinal tract into the

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,119
colon and there's a camera on it and we

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,560
can look uh at the inside of the colon

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,560
and assess the level of inflammation and

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,079
finally uh a pathologist can do

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,480
hystology on the colon tissue so let's

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,920
introduce hystology so how this works is

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,680
a biopsy is taken from the colon and

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,840
that's just a small piece of colon

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,760
tissue and that tissue is cut up into

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,520
smaller pieces and put on a slide and

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,480
then examined under a microscope to look

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,359
at uh cellular and tissue features from

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,760
that piece of the colon so uh

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,359
Pathologists have many Tools in sort of

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,640
their toolkit for studying uh tissue and

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,040
one of the most common tools they use is

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,799
this stain called h& this stands for

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,759
hematoxylin and Ain and these are two

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,840
stains that when mixed together can

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:18,280
provide contrast to a tissue uh section

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,400
so here we're looking at a uh colon

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,960
tissue biopsy and it's been stained with

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,799
this hematoxilin and Asin stain and the

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,520
hemx hemotoxylin stains the cell nucleus

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,560
uh this blue purple color and the Ain

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,520
stains every other part of the cell pink

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,399
so here you can see individual nuclei

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,439
and then everything else is pink and

37
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,720
what this does is it gives you this

38
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,119
really nice view of the tissue so here

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,079
we're looking at colonic Crypts which

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,360
are intestinal glands made up of

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,399
epithelial cells that line your entire

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,640
colon and this is a really common

43
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,920
structure that we see all over the colon

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,840
and it's really important for the colon

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,360
function now the colon itself has a

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,399
somewhat complicated organization so

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,240
let's walk through it so here's the

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,479
colon tube and it's made up of multiple

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,719
layers and these layers are the mucosa

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,759
the sub mucosa and the muscularis

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,400
propria so the mucosa is the innermost

52
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,560
layer and this is where uh food or

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,480
partially digested food gets pushed down

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,640
the track and there are colonic CPS that

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,680
line the mucosa then below the mucosa is

56
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,800
the sub mucosa and this is a dense and

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,400
sort of irregular kind of connective

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
tissue and then finally uh there's the

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,120
muscular propriate which is a thick

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,599
layer of muscle which is involved in

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,720
peristalsis which is pushing uh food

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,239
down the gut tube so now if we cut a

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,720
crosssection through the colon and then

64
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,319
have a pathologist do an h& stain of

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,640
that colon tissue uh piece we get this

66
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,000
nice cross-section and now here is the

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,080
inside of the colon where food and

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,519
microbes are kind of living and then

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,280
here's the outside of the colon and the

70
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,760
h& stain reveals the three layers so

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,440
here we have the mucosa which is made up

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,480
of these Crypts which are these circles

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,720
you see all along the surface and then

74
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,720
below that is the submucosa and then you

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,120
see the muscle layer and what you can

76
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,159
see is that the h& stain really reveals

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,200
the structure and organization of the

78
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,040
tissue so now let's go from the outside

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,000
in with the colon starting with the

80
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,920
muscle layer so here's a zoom in of h&

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,319
of colon muscle and there's two layers

82
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,239
this longitud layer and the circular

83
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,519
layer and again this is important for

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,200
pushing food through the gut and then in

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,799
between the layers there's this nerve

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,480
fiber or myenteric plexus and this does

87
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,640
a lot of things in the colon but one of

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,920
the things it's doing is kind of

89
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,159
controlling again that peristalsis the

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,599
movement of food through the gut now

91
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,480
let's go one layer in into the sub

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,760
mucosa the sub mucosa is this dense and

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,879
irregular connective tissue that has fat

94
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,040
cells blood vessels immune cells and

95
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,599
nerves here is a blood vessel

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
highlighted and you you can see it's

97
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,760
very red there are red blood cells in

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,040
there uh here's a nerve cell that's been

99
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,840
highlighted and then finally let's go to

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,720
the innermost layer which is the mucosa

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,360
and the mucosa has a somewhat

102
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,040
complicated structure the first layer of

103
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,000
the mucosa is the epithelial layer and

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,959
that's made up of these glands here or

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,800
the colonic Crypts and they're shown

106
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,160
here and here and this is a really

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,360
fascinating layer um at the base of

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,960
every single colonic Crypt there are

109
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,120
stem cells and these are are

110
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,520
regenerating the entire lining of the

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,880
colon every 5 to 7 days so the colon is

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,919
one of the fastest regenerating tissues

113
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,160
in the body and that's needed because as

114
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,720
food goes down the colon it's basically

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,520
sloughing off a lot of the cells in this

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,600
epithelial layer so this layer needs to

117
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,479
be regenerated constantly below the

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,800
epithelium in these colonic Crypts

119
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,039
there's the lamin propria which consists

120
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,639
of many immune cells and connective

121
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,120
tissue and then finally there's a layer

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,479
of muscle called the muscularis mucosa

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,800
which separates the mucosa from the sub

124
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,600
mucosa and this is important for local

125
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,600
motions of the colonic Crypts

126
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,759
here so in ulcerative colitis there are

127
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,120
dramatic changes to the normal uh colon

128
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,600
histology we see so in this cartoon on

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,280
the left we have healthy colon and on

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,960
the right we have ulcerative colitis and

131
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,199
there are sort of three big changes that

132
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,160
happen histologically one is cryp

133
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,360
distortion

134
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,759
so we go from these normal look colonic

135
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,560
crys to distorted ones or crys that have

136
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,919
these

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,639
abses um there's also epithelial changes

138
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,319
that happen uh such as metaplasia so

139
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,680
metaplasia is the appearance of a new

140
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,120
cell type that's not normally found in

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,960
that tissue and then finally we also

142
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,880
have immune infiltration so immune

143
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,720
infiltration means that immune cells are

144
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,280
showing up and this is because you know

145
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,000
ulcerative colitis is a disease with

146
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,919
chronic inflammation and these immune

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,479
cells are showing up and causing

148
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,960
inflammation in the mucosal layer and so

149
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,639
this could be neutrophils which we

150
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,560
talked about earlier which are kind of

151
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,000
responding to the bacteria in the colon

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,080
uh also other cells such as plasma cells

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
which is a type of B cell okay so here

154
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,280
we're looking at a histology image of

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,440
ulcerative colitis and on the right for

156
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,360
comparison we see healthy colonic Crypts

157
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,520
so there are several tissue features

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,479
that a pathologist can immediately spot

159
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,120
when looking at this h& stain of Al sort

160
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,400
of citis uh first they might say that

161
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,319
okay there's these Crypt abses where if

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,039
you look at the Crypt it looks like

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,360
there's some cells in the center of the

164
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,560
crypt and those are neutrophils which

165
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,240
are these immune cells that are

166
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,120
responding to bacteria that's

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,080
infiltrated into the mucosa uh the

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,319
pathologist will also spot that there's

169
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,039
ulceration so the formation of these

170
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,520
ulcers in the mucosa and this is where

171
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,479
ulcerative kitis gets his name and then

172
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,280
finally uh pathologist would point out

173
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,479
that there's basil plas cytosis so what

174
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,720
this is is the accumulation of plasma

175
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,919
cells which are a type of immune cell

176
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,840
and they are in the base of the mucosa

177
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,720
and they are these small blue cells that

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,080
have been stained by the h& and they

179
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,120
have very prominent blue nuclei as

180
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,759
another example here we're looking at

181
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
CPS that have undergone Distortion and

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
branching so you see this sort of

183
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,840
branching structure and again you can

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,319
pair this to the healthy colon you just

185
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,400
see these dramatic changes we also see

186
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,440
things like panth cell metaplasia so a

187
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,360
panis cell is a cell type that lives

188
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,120
near your intestinal stem cells and it

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,120
protects the stem cell against microbes

190
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,280
and normally these cells are not found

191
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,479
in the distal colon but during uler of

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,639
colitis you get this metaplasia where

193
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,680
the cell type appears and you can see

194
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,960
this if you look very closely in this

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,039
bright pink color that's a Telltale sign

196
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,039
that there's a pan the cell there
