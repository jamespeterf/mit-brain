1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,599
I'm excited to introduce our next

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,759
speaker, Leon Glicksman, who is a

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,000
professor of building technology and

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:19,320
mechanical engineering post tenure here

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,320
at MIT. Let's hear for Leon.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,880
Thank you, Jim. Um, he didn't mention

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,279
one of the important attributes I have.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,880
I'm a MIT lifer. Uh and if you have some

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,719
time later on I can tell you about what

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,800
Kendall Square looked like when I was an

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,520
undergraduate. It was a little different

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,840
than what we see now. Uh progress goes

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,000
on. So uh Jim asked me to talk about

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,559
this I think because I was the founder

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,440
of the building technology program which

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,760
is a uh a collaboration between the

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000
department of architecture, department

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,399
of mechanical and civil engineering. And

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
the idea is to try and bring those

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,079
engineering and science principles in to

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,000
the issues related to architecture. Um,

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,840
and in fact, Professor Reinhardt, who

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159
talked to you this morning, is one of

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
the distinguished faculty members in in

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,040
our group doing work in these particular

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,280
areas. Um, what he maybe didn't know, I

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
also did work before that in the heat

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,119
transfer lab. So, I'm going to try and

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,920
bring both of those kind of elements in

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,400
in the uh in the talk today. Uh, a

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,320
little truth in advertising. The way is

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,720
described as essential explore best

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,040
practices and emerging frontiers. Well,

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,439
emerging frontiers, we've got quite a

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,479
few when we talk about cooling within

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,360
this uh this realm. Um but best

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,640
practices, the problem we're facing is

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
I've just pulled out of one of the

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,240
literatures. This are some of the

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,040
tradeoffs or are options you have for

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,880
advanced cooling techniques. And and

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,439
certainly years ago when we're talking

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,759
about traditional kinds of data centers

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,719
um the issue about cooling was really

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,119
sort of hot K hot aisles cold aisles

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,320
kind of a thing using air cooling as a

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,640
way of cooling the system. Now in

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,119
present days and as we talk about future

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,280
trend we're talking about much higher

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,360
energy levels and we're talking about

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,000
challenges of really some different ways

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
of dealing with this. Um so what I'm

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,920
going to try and do is give you sort of

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
perspective both from the point of view

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
of heat transfer. What are some of the

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
basic heat transfer uh things that we're

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,480
dealing with as we look at a few of

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,840
these uh advanced kinds of techniques

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,519
which are available um and also what can

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,040
we say from the point of view of

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,599
building HVAC in terms of dealing with

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,920
issues related to the to the cooling.

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,319
And again as you've seen I'm sure and

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,239
know about there's all of these huge new

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,000
data centers which are going up and

66
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,480
there's the questions related to the

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,160
engineering of the uh and some of the

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,680
particular components. Um and if we do a

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
comparison between conventional

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,879
buildings and data centers one of the

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,920
things we see is very different kinds of

72
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,120
of of uh uh things that we're looking

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,879
after. Uh the building HVAC is

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,599
traditionally a very conservative

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,959
industry, very difficult to introduce

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,319
new technologies. Um uh people who build

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,840
buildings are really concerned about

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,560
minimum first cost. Um possibly energy

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,720
efficiency and the like. Uh but that's

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
uh that's not a particular concern.

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,000
Obviously in the data center we're

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
talking about rapid changes, new

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
technologies, major invest in

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
investigations and and and investments

85
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,159
in these types of things. Um uh also

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,120
when we're talking about uh buildings,

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,840
we're talking about energy per square

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,640
meter or floor area which may be 40 to

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,159
85 watts per square meter. Uh if we go

90
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,560
to labs, it's somewhat higher. And then

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,360
finally in clean rooms uh where we're

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,280
talking about where we essentially uh

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,439
develop some of these new integrated

94
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,439
circuits and the like we may get to high

95
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,280
energy levels but nowhere near the

96
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,519
energy levels when we talk about data

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,000
centers. So again different order of

98
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,920
magnitude in many cases a different way

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,959
of approaching the solution to these

100
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,280
kinds of problems. Um and as as you look

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,439
at the data center cooling systems, it

102
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,479
really sort of breaks down in my mind as

103
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,680
to three specific components if you

104
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,840
will. At one hand, uh we have the heat

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,520
transfer from individual chips. How do

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,479
we where we now are talking about

107
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,479
smaller and smaller integrated uh chips,

108
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,400
higher and higher power levels, how do

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,880
we deal with the heat transfer and

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,479
maintain these at some reasonable

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,320
operating temperatures. Second is um if

112
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,040
we can cool these, how do we transfer

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,240
that energy from the rack and from the

114
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,600
individual chips to the exterior. Uh and

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,240
third is what do we do at the exhaust

116
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,960
end of it? How do we essentially uh

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,000
exhaust this to the atmosphere or

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,600
possibly find some useful applications

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,479
for this kind of thing? um uh this the

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,479
the intermediate one the transfer energy

121
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,560
is one that requires some very serious

122
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,639
engineering but in general we're talking

123
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,720
about a water coupled system that's

124
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
going to use from individual racks to

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,440
the exterior and I think in some cases

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
the bigger technical challenges are at

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
the two extremes what do we do for

128
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,320
individual at the v individual chip

129
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,160
level and the other extreme is where we

130
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,919
have these huge amounts of thermal

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
energy which we're exhausting to the

132
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
environment how do

133
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
deal with that both from an

134
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,680
environmental point of view and how do

135
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,080
we possibly get some useful applications

136
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
from that that system. So if we first

137
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,759
talk about at the chip level surface

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,840
cooling of advanced devices u there are

139
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,440
different technologies which people have

140
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,000
looked at um this is a a review a recent

141
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,639
review that came out and one of the

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,759
techniques is what one might call direct

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,720
contact cooling and that's a a situation

144
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,639
where we have a chip and directly in

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,280
contact with it is some kind of cooling

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,840
medium usually a liquid in some form

147
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,000
which is used for there Um now included

148
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,080
in that was the conventional air cooled

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
system that we've talked about briefly.

150
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,000
Um and again that's relatively

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
straightforward. Again hot aisles, cold

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,440
aisles to do that. There are some issues

153
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,639
of engineering there um uh to make sure

154
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,759
the air goes where we want it to go. Uh

155
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,720
uh and uh some issues is uh here's an

156
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,880
underfloor uh cooled system and then a

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,880
system that brings the air to a

158
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
refrigeration unit which cools the air

159
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
back down. Again relatively

160
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
straightforward in the design of that

161
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,919
particular kind of system. The problem

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,639
that one gets into in the air cooled

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,120
system uh if we look at the purple bars

164
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,680
um the amount of fan power which is

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
required uh as we look at more advanced

166
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,319
systems we're talking about much more

167
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,919
energy required for the fan power to

168
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
essentially circulate the air in these

169
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,000
kinds of systems. The last bar if you

170
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
can see on the right hand side the lower

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,160
one is a water cooled system or again

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,199
the energy requirements as percent of

173
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,800
total power in the system is much lower.

174
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,479
Um

175
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
uh just to do a little bit of heat

176
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
transfer and there won't there won't be

177
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,840
any tests at the end of this hour but

178
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,840
just give you some some background in

179
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,160
heat transfer. Basically when we're

180
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,080
talking about direct contact what we're

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,960
talking about is hot surface. to be the

182
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,479
surface of the chip with the with the uh

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,639
electrical energy uh developed there and

184
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,120
then a cool fluid which is adjacent to

185
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,400
it. It may be force flow. It may be

186
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,039
essentially uh uh natural uh uh

187
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,680
circulation which required. Um and the

188
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,000
rate of heat transfer between the hot

189
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,919
surface and the cool fluid is going to

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,720
be a function of the surface area

191
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,759
required. And the temperature difference

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,280
between the surface of the chip and the

193
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,199
fluid temperature and by fluid

194
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
temperature I mean the bulk temperature

195
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,759
of fluid not the fluid directly adjacent

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,759
to the surface but the bulk temperature

197
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,479
of the fluid as it flows by the

198
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,360
particular surface. Um and if we want to

199
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,960
get a more technical we have a uh

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,840
component which is called the convective

201
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,840
heat transfer coefficient. Um basically

202
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,479
all the physics in terms of this cooling

203
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,759
are really wrapped up in that particular

204
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,840
um and those of you who have ever uh uh

205
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,599
dealt with this in many cases when we

206
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
get to convective heat transfer all they

207
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,000
know about is g that one correlation

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
after the other but what we're going to

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,520
talk about is the physics rather than

210
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,800
than that. So just order of magnitude

211
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,080
things. If we're talking about air

212
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,159
cooling, um we have a typical value for

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,039
what that heat transfer coefficient is.

214
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,800
Or maybe a better way to look at this is

215
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,880
given a certain temperature difference

216
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,200
from the surface to the fluid of say 20°

217
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,839
K. Uh we can get an idea of what the

218
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,640
heat transfer per unit area is. In this

219
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,920
case, it's about uh a tenth to 210 of a

220
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,320
watt per square centimeter. Um now if we

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,160
want to compare with what we need if we

222
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,279
look at some ideas of what the energy uh

223
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,760
uh is in these modern chips again as uh

224
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,440
uh as the number of transistor counts

225
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,600
keeps going up the amount of power

226
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,680
required and that's the upper curve that

227
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,640
you see there uh which can be read from

228
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,920
the lefth hand scale um that continually

229
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,800
goes up and also the uh heat flux which

230
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,440
is again the power per unit area

231
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,279
increases considerably from uh average

232
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,519
in 2000 maybe u uh the order of 10 now

233
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
in the orders of hundreds of watts per

234
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,279
square centimeter. So we're talking

235
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,440
about a huge increase in that heat flux

236
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,440
rate. And again just to get an idea of

237
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,760
more modern things I tried to get some

238
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,120
numbers from the recent Nvidia chip u uh

239
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,240
numbers which are quoted as something

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,640
like 2700 watts and uh the area given

241
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,519
there. So we get something order of over

242
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,360
300 watts per square centimeters. So

243
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,880
again much higher heat flux rates that

244
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
we have to deal with in this kind of

245
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,320
thing. Um and there is the issue of just

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,560
what really is going on in Nvidia but uh

247
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
we can we can make some guesses on that.

248
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,320
So one of the ways that people are

249
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,320
talking about in the now and in the

250
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,040
future is some way that we can directly

251
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,200
immerse the electronics in fluid. Now

252
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,800
this would have to be a dialectric fluid

253
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,000
obviously that doesn't conduct

254
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,160
electricity. um uh and the hope is with

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,079
this kind of direct immersion or a

256
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,640
system of this sort we can get much

257
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,640
higher rates of heat transfer. So if we

258
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,200
want to look at what are some of the

259
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,800
heat transfer mechanisms first of all we

260
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,279
would have simply natural convection

261
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,680
that's we have a heated surface and

262
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,800
because the fluid next to the surface

263
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,959
temperature goes up uh its uh density

264
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,440
goes down and we have a buoyancy effect

265
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,600
so in fact the fluid will start rising

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
and what you see on the right hand side

267
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,839
is a graphic of the temperature

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,959
distributions adjacent to the surface of

269
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,680
a heated surface and you can see that um

270
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,880
uh uh the fluid tends to rise on that

271
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,920
particular surface and we can get if we

272
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,959
had a liquid like water we can get heat

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,040
fluxes of the order of maybe one to two

274
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,640
watts per square centimeter. Again, not

275
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,120
good enough for the kind of things we're

276
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,440
talking about for advanced systems. If

277
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,320
we go to a force convection where

278
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,320
essentially we force a fluid over the

279
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,560
surface of the chip, we can get to the

280
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,399
order of 10 to 20 watts per square

281
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,880
meters for this kind of thing. So we're

282
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,200
approaching the kind of uh of uh uh uh

283
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,800
uh performance we want. And then finally

284
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,920
what people are talking about now is

285
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,079
using boiling changes of phase as

286
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
essentially a way of doing that heat

287
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,839
transfer for that surface of the chip.

288
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,160
And what I've shown here on this plot is

289
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,160
um the heat flux and and look at the

290
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,079
left hand scale of that watts per square

291
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,839
centimeters as a function of the

292
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,640
temperature difference. This is the

293
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,480
temperature of the uh surface relative

294
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,720
to the temperature of the saturated

295
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,880
temperature of the fluid or the boiling

296
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,480
temperature if you will. And one of the

297
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,959
things you can see here is it's a

298
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,200
nonlinear kind of relationship here. For

299
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,320
example, as the this temperature

300
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,959
difference goes from 5 to 10° you can

301
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,240
see a uh order of magnitude increase in

302
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,240
the heat flux rate. Why so? Well, what's

303
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,560
happening then as you increase that

304
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,560
temperature difference initially at low

305
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,040
temperatures, you'll start to see one or

306
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,600
two points where in fact vapor bubbles

307
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,160
will form uh will attach from the

308
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,959
surface. And what that's doing is as the

309
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,639
vapor leaves the surface, cool water is

310
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,800
rushing back into the surface and

311
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,839
essentially providing the cooling that

312
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,360
we see in this kind of system. As we

313
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
increase the temperature difference,

314
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,880
more and more of those sites are now

315
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,920
starting to perform uh uh develop vapor

316
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,000
bubbles, we get much more action in this

317
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,680
particular kind of system. So it looks

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,519
really great that we'll just essentially

319
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,079
increase the delta t and we'll get

320
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,320
higher and higher heat flux rate. And I

321
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,720
guess this is some work pool boiling

322
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,120
results for dialectric fluids. We see

323
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,040
the same kind of thing that we've seen

324
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,440
before in this particular kind of

325
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,440
system. But let me caution you, we

326
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
sometimes run into, and that's just some

327
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
some visuals of what that looks like. As

328
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,399
we go to higher and higher heat flux

329
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,800
rates, we can sometimes get to what's

330
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,920
called the critical heat flux. And what

331
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,560
happens in that case is um the vapor

332
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,120
bubbles now completely cover the entire

333
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,120
surface. So much so that the liquid

334
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,200
water that's going to quench the surface

335
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,680
can't get into the surface. So

336
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,440
essentially, we have a complete vapor

337
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
layer over the surface.

338
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,360
uh and then the vapor bubbles form from

339
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,320
that. That means very poor heat transfer

340
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,160
and so-called critical heat flux in some

341
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,240
time in the field we call it the burnout

342
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,720
point for obvious reasons. If I have a

343
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,199
electrical input, if I get to that point

344
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,360
beyond I can't pro provide the cooling

345
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,760
that's required. So in fact we get into

346
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,240
a situation where essentially we get to

347
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,160
very high surface temperatures where in

348
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,480
fact radiation heat transfer becomes the

349
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,079
mechanism. So again a caution if we're

350
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,920
going to use this kind of system we have

351
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,639
to be careful about what the upper

352
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,040
limits are when we use it. Another

353
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,720
approach is a so-called indirect contact

354
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,560
cooling system and there are again a

355
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,880
number of different options which are

356
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,560
available for using this system. One of

357
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,800
the most common ones that people are

358
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,839
using is what's called the microch and

359
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,680
this is where we have a a high

360
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,839
conductivity material for example

361
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,320
copper. we have a whole series of micro

362
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,800
fins which are formed on this particular

363
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
channel and then we flow fluid the

364
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,279
cooling fluid through this particular

365
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,480
channel. Um and there's a series of heat

366
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,399
transfer resistances here from the the

367
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,160
red which is indicating what would be

368
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:56,000
the uh uh the chip itself to the uh

369
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,320
initial surface of this uh of of this uh

370
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,959
uh device. uh and we can see conduction

371
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,880
there and in fact that helps to even out

372
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,320
if we have any disparities in what the

373
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,880
heat flux rate is across the surface. U

374
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,800
then heat transfer up to the surface of

375
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,839
the fins and then from the fins to the

376
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,000
fluid and the fluid is flowing down

377
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,880
between the fins. And what we find out

378
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,120
is in most cases um we're in what's

379
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,800
called laminer flow. Uh and the

380
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,160
resistant to heat transfer is going to

381
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,839
be directly um uh inverse to the

382
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,480
distance between the fins. So we get the

383
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
fins closer and closer together. We get

384
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,839
smaller resistance, higher heat transfer

385
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,399
from the surface to the fluid. Um and in

386
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
fact this chart gives you some idea and

387
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,639
this is in terms of the the blue line

388
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,760
which is idea of what the resistance is

389
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,920
as we reduce the fin spacing and you can

390
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,160
see that the resistance goes down

391
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,160
significantly in this case. But

392
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,279
unfortunately we run into a problem and

393
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,759
that problem is that um we have to flow

394
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,680
the fluid between these channels. as the

395
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,680
channels get smaller and smaller, the

396
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,160
pressure drop to force the fluid through

397
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,360
the channels gets higher and higher so

398
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,320
that we run into a a a significant

399
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,839
problem here is what's practical from a

400
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,360
uh uh engineering point of view.

401
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,480
Um now if we can do better in the microf

402
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,880
channel uh uh heat transfer, one of the

403
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,519
things we can look at is the so-called

404
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,399
boiling again. And the idea now is we

405
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,720
send a fluid through this channel

406
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,560
which saturation temperature is close to

407
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,600
the temperature of the fins. And now in

408
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,759
fact we can have boiling occurring here.

409
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,680
First nucleate boiling then as we get to

410
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,720
higher flux we get to so-called slug

411
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,440
flow annular flow. And it's interesting

412
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,360
parallel because years ago we looked at

413
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,360
the exact same kind of problem of

414
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
flowblowing but it had to do with

415
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,040
nuclear reactors because one of the

416
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,279
issues one of the main uh uh uh methods

417
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,320
for designing nuclear reactors was

418
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,320
so-called boiling uh uh boiling uh

419
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,400
nuclear reactors where essentially we

420
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,880
force water through the channels um and

421
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,520
uh we allowed that to to change in phase

422
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,720
and there was a huge amount of research

423
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,000
it's related to the issue of what's what

424
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,679
what are some uh safe measures and uh

425
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
safe levels for using those particular

426
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,679
kinds of things. So it may well be we

427
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,480
want to go back and review some of that

428
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,799
literature of that uh era to try and see

429
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,559
how we can get some uh ideas how we can

430
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,840
do a better job of designing these

431
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,919
particular kinds of systems. Uh again,

432
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,160
if we're talking about the situation

433
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,000
with flow blowing, we've got a number of

434
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,160
different uh uh uh flow regimes. You can

435
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,840
see a flow regime where we have vapor in

436
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,760
the in the middle. We've got liquid

437
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,480
around the periphery of these types of

438
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,480
things. Uh again, in this particular

439
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,640
case, this is a time sequence where we

440
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,120
see what's going on over a period of

441
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,080
time for again micro channels in this

442
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,559
case. Um and you can see when we get

443
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,120
down to the bottom channel we have again

444
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,080
a problem which may be very severe and

445
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,320
that's the issue was sometimes called uh

446
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,160
burnout. And that again that's is our

447
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,000
situation where essentially there's

448
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
vapor on the surface. We don't have

449
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,320
liquid. We do not get high heat transfer

450
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,720
rates and in fact we may get into a

451
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,400
problem here in terms of uh uh uh are we

452
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,360
going to get safe operation for our

453
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,280
particular systems. Um there are some

454
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,440
other issues mechanical issues you need

455
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,360
to talk about. How do you bring the

456
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,840
fluid into the uh uh microchs uh if the

457
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,640
if the uh entrance flow on the right

458
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,960
hand side is so-called horizontal inlet

459
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,160
which is the inlets at the same plane as

460
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,320
the microchs we may run into problems

461
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,200
because we won't get uniform flow

462
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,640
through all the channels. Um it turns

463
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,799
out in fact in this particular

464
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,120
simulation if we do it what's called

465
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,640
vertical where in fact the inlets are at

466
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,559
right angles to the plane of this we can

467
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,760
solve most of those particular problems.

468
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,640
And again for the horizontal you can see

469
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,360
this is the speed of the air in

470
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,520
individual channels and you can see very

471
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,360
great disparity in what that speed is.

472
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,799
So it's again something we need to worry

473
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,200
about. Um um there are a number of

474
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,280
design parameters that we need to uh

475
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,360
concern ourselves with if we want to

476
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,840
optimize this. One has to do with the

477
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,480
cross-sectional geometry. How small

478
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,400
should these channels be? What geometry

479
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,000
should they be? What's the surface

480
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
roughness? Can we enhance the heat

481
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,559
transfer if we make the channels rough?

482
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,240
What's the velocity?

483
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,760
In some cases, we can look at a

484
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,000
situation where rather than having

485
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,480
laminer flow, we can have what's known

486
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,200
turbulent flow. And in that case if we

487
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,520
do that if we add surface roughness and

488
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,360
that we can substantially enhance the

489
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,480
rate of heat transfer for these types of

490
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,280
things. So again all opportunities which

491
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,840
can we use to try and optimize the

492
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,559
design of these this for the future uh

493
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,559
systems that we have to deal with. Um

494
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,960
also the question of what can we use as

495
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,000
working fluids. um liquid metals I think

496
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,200
are really sort of extreme and and these

497
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,360
kinds of things but possibly uh the I

498
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,840
adding uh particles to the fluid to

499
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,000
increase their uh thermal conductivity

500
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,880
would work and again flow boiling issues

501
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,559
of instability and the like um and if we

502
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,440
really want to look in the future here's

503
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,960
a slide from um uh the DARPA uh the

504
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
defense people are looking at even

505
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,840
higher heat flux rates where they're

506
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,840
looking at uh how do we deal with heat

507
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,679
flux rates where in fact we have heat

508
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,240
flux of the same order as the heat flux

509
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,840
on the surface of the sun and the

510
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,320
question is how do we find some

511
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,640
solutions for this? Uh now they're using

512
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,360
it for high power lasers and things of

513
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,600
this sort but it may well be again as

514
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,760
the chips keep getting smaller and the

515
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
power gets higher we may have to deal

516
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,640
with uh those kind of heat transfer

517
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,320
rates. Now at the other extreme is what

518
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,280
do we do with this huge amount of energy

519
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,000
which now we've transferred from the

520
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,400
racks to the outside. What do we do with

521
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,200
this area? In fact, here's one example.

522
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,120
Uh, NEC is talking about example. Again,

523
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
this is the old air cooled kind of

524
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,799
systems. And you notice in this

525
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,960
particular case, um, they've already

526
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,720
estimated what the temperature is. And

527
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
one of the challenges and we need to

528
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,039
look at is if I assume that I'm going to

529
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,720
run this so I can cool the air or the

530
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,480
liquid to 20° C, can I essentially do it

531
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,840
in a location where the ambient

532
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,760
temperature is lower than that? or if

533
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,559
not so do I have to use liquid

534
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,320
evaporation as a way to get to the wet

535
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,919
bulb temperature which might give me the

536
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,679
20° C that I use. So again something we

537
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,320
have and again part of the issues we

538
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,039
have to look at is how the exhaust from

539
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,120
the individual units integrate with each

540
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,360
other and how they and affect the

541
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,679
environment. Uh so there's been some

542
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,400
computational fluid dynamics looking at

543
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,760
that. Certainly evaporators have the

544
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,280
same kind of issues. Uh and again uh

545
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,200
similar to what Elsa has talked about

546
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,600
when we talk about so-called free

547
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
cooling we're talking if we use

548
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,080
evaporation

549
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,679
to meet this uh the this heat load which

550
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,880
comes out we're talking about huge

551
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,240
amounts of water use estimate I've done

552
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,320
is that we're talking about 200

553
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,039
megawatts and we're using water

554
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,039
evaporation to meet that need we're

555
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,640
talking about the water consumption of

556
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,840
roughly a community of 15,000 people and

557
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,159
as we scale up the even larger size

558
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
systems, we're talking about huge water

559
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,039
water uses. And the issue is where does

560
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,600
that water come from? Uh, another issue

561
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,799
if we're talking about so-called wet

562
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,480
cooling towers, we see in the HVAC

563
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,559
industry something called Legionnaire's

564
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,240
disease where if we're not careful about

565
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,080
how we control the uh uh the the quality

566
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,799
of the water in the system, we can in

567
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,400
fact get into situations associated with

568
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,240
that. Um another problem of similar or

569
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
is some people have talked about well

570
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,679
why don't we just use saltwater cooling

571
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,679
towers. Um and the problem of course is

572
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
we don't then have to use fresh water

573
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,320
but then the question is what about the

574
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,799
drift from those saltwater towers. Where

575
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,960
is all that salt then? And then we have

576
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,600
the environmental issues that we have to

577
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,320
deal with in that particular case.

578
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,240
um other people. Here's a proposal in

579
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,640
Portugal. And the idea here is we're

580
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,000
going to use uh the we're going to site

581
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,880
it close to the seawater here. Uh we're

582
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,880
going to draw seawater in uh use it for

583
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,760
cooling and then the warm water will

584
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,360
exhaust. Again, the problem and again in

585
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,600
work I've done in the past on cooling

586
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,000
towers is people who design power

587
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,200
plants, there's always the environmental

588
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,280
issues. What do we do? If we have a warm

589
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,039
uh exhaust, we have so-called thermal

590
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,520
pollution. There may be problems

591
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,200
associated with the aquatic life.

592
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,280
Similarly, at the inlet, we have to

593
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,760
worry about possible damage there. So,

594
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,000
again, not simple problems to deal with.

595
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,120
And and as you can see, a number of the

596
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,400
new um data centers are not necessarily

597
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,919
located near large bodies of water. So,

598
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,039
we may not be able to use that

599
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,520
particular kind of system. Um people

600
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,360
talk about using nuclear plants. One of

601
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,360
the things we have to keep in mind is a

602
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
typical operranic

603
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,960
efficiency of a nuclear plant is about

604
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,240
33%.

605
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,480
That means for each uh gigawatt of power

606
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,120
which we we produce we have two

607
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,320
gigawatts of thermal energy which we

608
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,919
again we have to inject to the

609
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,200
environment. So that says the whole

610
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,679
complex nuclear plant plus data center

611
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
we're talking about 3 gawatts of thermal

612
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,120
energy that we have to deal with. So

613
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,840
again it may compound some of the

614
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,480
problems that we've talked about before.

615
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,279
Uh people also talked about some

616
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,159
applications using thermal energy for

617
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:09,360
distillation for refrigeration

618
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:12,400
uh and the like. Um and then finally um

619
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:17,559
let me just end up with the economist

620
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,559
magazine's uh solution for data centers.

621
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,880
So with that I'll end. Thank you.

622
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,440
>> Eric Schmidt just bought a rocket

623
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:38,840
company and when somebody said, "Is that

624
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,840
for this?" He had a one-word reply. Yes.

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,400
>> Other questions for Liam?

626
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,960
>> Yes, sir.

628
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,760

629
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,360
viability for for heat to power

630
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,720
recovery?

631
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,960
>> There certainly is some, but again,

632
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,799
there's a trade-off. To get any kind of

633
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,480
reasonable efficiency from that, you

634
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,080
have to increase the temperature that

635
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,440
you're rejecting the heat. And the

636
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,960
trade-off, of course, is what does that

637
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,720
mean in terms of the lifetime of your

638
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,400
electronic components if you get too

639
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,760
high. But yes, that's certainly

640
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
something that would that can be

641
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,720
considered.

>> Would 60 CD be at all infra?

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,120
of would start to start to look

645
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,330
reasonable. Yes. Yes.

>> You can hand out the quizzes now.

649
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,919
>> Okay.

650
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,559
>> Perfect presentation. I want to know

651
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,919
about if we build the data center in the

652
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,360
mountain or maybe in very cold weather

653
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,960
is it help for the cooling system?

654
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,120
>> Well certainly yeah if it's very cold

655
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
weather in fact we probably don't have

656
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,279
to use evaporation at all. We can simply

657
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,880
just use what's called a dry cooling

658
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,520
system where essentially we bring in the

659
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,600
cold air over heat exchanger tubes and

660
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,640
use that to cool the cool particular

661
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,640
system.

662
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,880
>> Yes sir. Uh

663
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,840
>> yeah. So I also wonder like what if we

664
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,120
build the data center like as at a part

665
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,520
of uh the city sewage system because

666
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,919
like there's constantly water flow in

667
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,200
which channels the heat energy and uh

668
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,799
yeah

669
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,480
>> would that be viable?

670
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,880
>> I think again it's a question of order

671
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,200
of magnitude. We've people have even

672
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,279
looked at essentially conventional power

673
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,039
plants. Could we use somehow use a

674
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,919
sewage system for providing the energy

675
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,919
storage? In most cases, the flow rate is

676
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,559
one order of magnitude lower than what's

677
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,360
even needed for heating and cooling a

678
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,960
large uh metropolitan area of buildings.

679
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,720
So probably uh doesn't make sense. Now

680
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,080
um what does make sense in some cases

681
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,200
the so-called cogent plants um where

682
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,279
essentially just as in power plant power

683
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,600
systems what they do is they use the

684
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:04,640
exhaust as I've showed um with a a a

685
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,200
absorption system to prevent to provide

686
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,520
cool water or in the in the summer or

687
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
heating in in the winter. So some in

688
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,399
fact New York City for example has

689
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,559
codegens. Boston traditionally had some

690
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,880
of those particular systems. There again

691
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,679
is the question um uh really just the

692
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,120
engineering of uh is the city close

693
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,960
going to be close to where your data

694
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,360
center is. If it's far away then the

695
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,480
whole problem of how you transfer the

696
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,799
probably heated water or steam from the

697
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,200
data center to this part location. In

698
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,080
many cases we find the economics of that

699
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,399
doesn't really make sense.

700
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,399
>> Yes sir.

701
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,600
>> Thank you. Uh you were talking in the

702
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,640
beginning of the presentation about uh

703
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,200
liquid cooling for the servers or for

704
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,559
the chips and the different types like

705
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,120
micro channels etc. Do you have any idea

706
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,039
which type of liquid cooling is the best

707
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,919
or which you know is going to be the

708
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,159
solution of choice in the long term?

709
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,799
>> Well, it's it's

710
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,559
um I think again there's a number of

711
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,320
different choices. I think the microch

712
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,880
is one that's been very popular in this

713
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,320
particular case. Um but I think as I

714
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,880
said looking in the future it's a

715
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,320
microch with a liquid cooling where

716
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
essentially you have a phase change

717
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,919
where you have boiling occurring in that

718
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,159
particular kind of system that'll give

719
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,159
the highest rates of heat flux to the

720
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,320
particular fluid. But as I said there

721
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
are a lot of technical problems to make

722
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,120
sure that you don't get situations where

723
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
you create too much vapor so you don't

724
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,520
get the kind of cooling levels that you

725
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,640
want. So that would be one I' I' I'd

726
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,120
sort of put my bet on and maybe it's one

727
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,360
Nvidia is doing right now.

728
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,360
>> Yes, ma'am.

729
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,640
>> All right. Uh this might be an

730
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,559
interesting question for you. Um so I'm

731
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,159
a I'm a research analyst for Uptime

732
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,120
Institute. I write about cooling systems

733
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,200
day in day out. Um I wanted to skip back

734
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,039
to the start campus in Portugal that's

735
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,520
doing the heat rejection to seawater.

736
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,720
>> Yes ma'am.

737
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,320
>> Um you had raised the concern of um heat

738
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,080
pollution in the water from raising the

739
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,480
temperature of the outgoing water.

740
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,320
>> Right.

741
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,159
>> Um a few data centers have been built

742
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,559
this way. One of them got environmental

743
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,080
approval on the Stockton River in

744
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,240
California because their delta T was

745
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,960
only 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Um

746
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
so what would well slight pivot but

747
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,919
still on the same topic. What would you

748
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,520
say to the uh the the assertion that

749
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,679
that heat is being put into the

750
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,000
environment anyway and if you can

751
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,120
control your delta t in the seawater is

752
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,200
it really more impactful?

753
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,200
>> Well, if you can control the delta t so

754
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,840
that the energy rise is very modest.

755
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,080
Yes, that certainly is a a reasonable

756
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,080
approach. But again looking at the

757
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,679
experience that large power plants,

758
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,960
nuclear power plants and the like have

759
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,039
had just the environmental licensing to

760
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,279
prove to people that the delta t is not

761
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,960
going to be too high. Uh and then the

762
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,520
question is where do you measure the

763
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,960
delta tree right at the point of where

764
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,200
the hot water is uh uh brought into the

765
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,200
sea or do you say some distance away

766
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,360
because clearly it's going to change

767
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,640
over time. Uh and a lot of the

768
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,399
environmentalists say you've got to

769
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,279
measure right at the point where the

770
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,919
where the hot water enters the the the

771
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,880
sea and uh and then you've got to relate

772
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,320
that to the what aquatic species around

773
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,399
are they going to have any damage or

774
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,000
they're not. But it's it can in some

775
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,159
cases what people have found after they

776
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,559
built it in fact that it's helped the

777
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,720
aquatic life by raising the temperatures

778
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,399
to some extent. But again, it it just

779
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
seems like it almost every one of these

780
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,559
large plant there's a large series of

781
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,880
questions you have to go out. But you're

782
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,799
right, if the delta t is small, this

783
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,080
kind of system works quite well. But if

784
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,919
you're talking about something which is

785
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,559
a gigawatt,

786
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,480
you would have to have a huge outfall.

787
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,480
So in fact, that the delta t would stay

788
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,480
small.

789
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,679
Okay.

790
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,440
exercise. Sorry. Um,

791
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,600
>> uh, there's been a little bit of

792
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,440
divergence in perspectives on inlet

793
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,919
temperature with Nvidia maintaining a

794
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,320
45C inlet, which is much higher than a

795
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,080
lot of the other providers. Um, they're

796
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,240
trying to defend the sustainability of

797
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,600
that going forward. Uh, do you see a

798
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
horizon on that or what's your

799
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,960
perspective on how long or or if they

800
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,919
can maintain that that high inlet

801
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,279
temperature? Well, in some sense, I

802
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,360
think the answer to the question is

803
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,960
outside my realm of understanding and

804
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,640
it's the issue of what does it mean for

805
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,240
the electronics to be running at higher

806
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,760
temperatures and you know I I see in the

807
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,200
suggestion the literature as you go to

808
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,440
higher temperatures you have problems

809
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,360
about how the failure of these

810
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,960
particular electronics. So as I said

811
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
there's that that kind of trade-off one

812
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,240
has to make. Yes, if you can get the

813
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,039
higher outlet temperatures, you can have

814
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,720
more useful purposes for this. Okay, but

815
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,000
then what does it mean in terms of

816
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,000
particular components that you have?

817
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,360
Okay, let's hear it for Leon.
