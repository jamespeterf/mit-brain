1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
we're realizing that the whole

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,000
generative AI boom is actually starting

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,960
to impact autonomous vehicles a lot of

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
the development that we can do could be

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,839
completely automated whether that is

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,640
generating synthetic environments to

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,359
test whether that is some AI system that

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,680
will make high level decisions

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,599
immediately in the future I think a good

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,400
chunk of this AI discussion will form

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,960
into what we call embodied AI putting

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,320
the AI into a system say on little

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,559
quadropad dog like robots or humanoid

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,920
robots frankly we might realize that

15
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,840
making high level decisions for say a

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
large number of space Vehicles might

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,559
become so much more effective that we'd

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,200
be very comfortable just sending out

19
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,920
millions of vehicles to the asteroid

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,800
belt whether that's for mining or

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,800
sustainability and so there's just so

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,160
many applications that we would pursue

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,320
that I think self-driving cars sometimes

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,960
