00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,080
I've seen this as a call to action and a

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,340
way for me to step up to the problem

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,510
with a potential solution.

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,800
I am researching distributed energy

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,840
resources. I'm compiling a data set that

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,400
takes the data on wind turbines, solar

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,880
panels, electric vehicle chargers, and

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,039
power plants and sees how that data is

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,960
correlated within counties based on the

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,600
different characteristics such as

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,239
population, education, and race. I

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,800
started off first on doing California in

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,960
the hopes of moving on to other states

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
within the US. The most interesting

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,640
thing that I've learned from my research

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,000
is about distributed energy resources in

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,920
general. I had never understood how they

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
were integrated into the grid or how

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,680
they had such a profound impact on the

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,559
energy that we have. I saw this project

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,199
and I saw how they are using distributed

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,200
energy resources and the data they have

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,040
in order to make a difference so that

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,840
other researchers and politicians can be

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,280
informed and make good decisions in the

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,310
future.
