1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,119
let's get started uh welcome back 21m

2
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,880
383 computational music theory and

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,439
Analysis went through probably one of

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,519
the most slide heavy one of the fastest

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,199
classes ever on Wednesday that I'll be

6
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,599
doing uh this semester today we're going

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,160
to switch gears we're going to do one of

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,920
the least Tech uh heavy classes in this

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,960
semester and then we'll probably keep

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,719
going back and forth this is the only

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,239
one that in my particular notes it for

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,440
my lecture it says mike Don't Panic

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,199
there actually is no power point because

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,440
I was panicking the other day when I was

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,359
preparing this I was like wait wait wait

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,680
wait I did I delete it no there is

17
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,920
nothing because I want us to step back

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,079
for a little bit and think about some of

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,760
the things and do some work on um some

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,360
of the things to do with what we mean by

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,360
music because various musical points

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,560
because there's a lot of things that we

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,960
can know that are um you know just sort

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,720
of um uh just just sort of intuitively

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,479
we all know what that is but then um we

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,200
might not um you know we might not be

27
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,680
able to explain it to a computer because

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,159
computers are smart or computers are

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,479
dumb what do you think shout it out dumb

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,560
neither no neither dumb neither no no

31
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,960
smart okay I think computers are really

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,479
really dumb until we make them smart so

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,320
or something like that great there's

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,720
some people in the back that whose names

35
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,960
I don't know could you take a sheet of

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,560
paper you can also use your outline to

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,799
put your name on it because uh the

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,439
outlines for reading later and it's kind

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,200
of nice that this way you have it for

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,159
later and this way you won't um sort of

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,200
get me if I go out of order right um

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,079
okay

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,240
so I'm seeing who your names are can you

44
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,960
take a second and at least the person

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,679
you're sharing a table or sharing the

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,360
invisible table with um and introduce

47
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,959
yourself if you don't know that

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,200
where okay now add into your

49
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,319
conversation add into your conversation

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
what you think a note is you can also

51
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,480
keep getting to know each other the same

52
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,480
time but what you think a note

53
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:33,319
is okay I'm going to be asking you for

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:37,160
for some definitions in a second but

55
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,440
before we get to that um all I want you

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,360
to do is take your definitions you've

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,720
kind of got them first thing and you

58
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
just got to count notes okay so I'm

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,959
going to sing some things and you tell

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,360
me how many notes I sing so write them

61
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:55,239
down and then I'll ask them later

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,239
um first

63
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,840
set pretty easy right

64
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,400
second

65
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,770
one third

66
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,770
[Music]

67
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,159
one fourth one

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,030
[Music]

69
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
and fifth

70
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,599
one great talk with your talk with your

71
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,720
neighbor and see how many if you got

72
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,080
answers that line up with each

73
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,439
other okay let's let's come back

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,560
together

75
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,480
um let's come back together we have um

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,879
uh I believe that the normal

77
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,799
distribution of names in this class is

78
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,680
kind of like the uh letters in the

79
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,640
alphabet so we we'll start with J's I'll

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,400
call who's the alphabetically first J is

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,120
it

82
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,920
Jason Jason um something something like

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,239
and if I change the things I'm doing it

84
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,239
accidentally because I don't remember

85
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,239
what I saying but um the first

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,880
one three notes three notes how many

87
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,520
agree how many disagree

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,000
agrees

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,880
disagrees okay good that was the right

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,280
answer I saying three notes good who's

91
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,759
alphabetically next after Jason we have

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,600
we have some Jonathan Jordans we have

93
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,960
Jake oh okay you we went out sorry about

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,479
that Jake um no even if we do Jacob or

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,840
something it's still I'm still wrong

96
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,400
okay

97
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,400
Jake this is what I

98
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,880
saying one note agree or disagree who

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,000
agrees who

100
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,919
disagrees good everybody is wrong I

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,280
Sayang four

102
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,590
um okay next note well next one I did I

103
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,800
I went I went up

104
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:13,400
[Music]

105
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,520
right uh next up alphabetically would be

106
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,080
uh Jonathan comes before John and comes

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,919
before Jordan so

108
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:26,560
Jonathan okay uh my was two notes two

109
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:29,680
notes good uh who

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,360
agrees okay we got some agrees um who

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
dis

112
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,160
agrees okay good we'll we'll continue

113
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,840
with the J's on that John you disagreed

114
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,280
what's the number you came up with uh I

115
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,080
thought because you sing a lot I think

116
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,960
you Sayang at least one note oh okay

117
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,080
okay

118
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,919
well greater than one note no greater

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,440
than or equal to one note right okay so

120
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,240
that that takes a little that's that's a

121
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,479
pretty pretty broad spectrum I like that

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,160
it's always good um who who agrees with

123
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,360
greater than or equal to one note or or

124
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,600
wants more disagree if you want more

125
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,120
specificity than that who agrees with

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,520
greater than or equal to one note good

127
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,520
Jordan's on your side and you just got

128
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,680
some some people good so who disagrees

129
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,000
with that with everything beforehand up

130
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,759
till now great so um I think we have um

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
no Jason we've already gone through who

132
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,120
who raise your hands again if you

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,039
disagree I want to keep going

134
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,199
alphabetically next among the disagreer

135
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:33,560
and that would that might be uh Kara

136
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:36,400
Karima yeah yeah uh I I wrote na na okay

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,319
well well na a or we we'll we'll make it

138
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,360
so it parses in Python not a number is

139
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,880
that okay okay good good and any um

140
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:52,120
anybody still still have your number not

141
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:55,199
said Adam yeah I said 14 or 15 14 or 15

142
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,319
okay very very specific um what did you

143
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,680
base that on so you went from a c to

144
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,319
either a c or a d so it's like if you go

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,160
all the chromatic notes and slur them

146
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,280
all that's what you get okay okay good

147
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,599
so we have we have a range extension um

148
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,160
good uh anybody else have a number that

149
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:15,000
doesn't hasn't been done

150
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,039
yet okay um so that's that's

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,319
particularly good um this one I went

152
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,199
with INF oh sorry I wasn't telling you

153
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,440
what what my numbers were yet okay well

154
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:31,520
that one that's what I went with um and

155
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,520
then uh next one D

156
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,840
um we have

157
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,919
some you want we have a a listener but

158
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,840
you want to be a participant or also

159
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,039
yeah go ahead so with that one I wrote

160
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,199

um yep and now oh no I was giving I was

165
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,280
giving the right numbers yep so I'm

166
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,400
going to say I did that I did that uh

167
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,080
nobody disagreed the correct answer

168
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,879
there was

169
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,639
two and don't worry don't worry this is

170
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:18,360

said one one good good who agrees with

178
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,919
one good how many people have heard

179
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,279
neither zero nor

180
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,120
one y so when I was not writing a lot of

181
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,760
these I put two answers to a lot of them

182
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,600
depending on okay but you can only give

183
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:54,399
one right now well I was how I not how

184
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,120
i' like pitch wise and I was I was

185
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,000
taking I I was taking perception

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
spectrograms and a clap has like all of

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,880
the

188
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,160
so so so give me a number so that one

189
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,480
would also be INF INF okay

190
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,399
good this one I'm going to go with

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,640
zero and I will tell you um there isn't

192
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,959
a single answer on here that I couldn't

193
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,480
that you couldn't argue for and be

194
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:24,880
correct so um why three notes I think we

195
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,959
all agreed because I think I saying bom

196
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,360
bom bom I count each of those as one

197
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,360
note right second one was four

198
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:42,120
cuz was a half a whole note tied to a

199
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,120
quarter note tied to uh a 60th note tied

200
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,839
to a 64th

201
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,640
note and I do believe that is the

202
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,600
closest shortest representation I can do

203
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,399
notationally so I was thinking in a

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,320
notational sphere

205
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,720
here this time with the gando I was

206
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,680
thinking of it as an infinite number of

207
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,000
notes because if it's continuous it

208
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,959
could be but on the other hand it any of

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,040
these other ones could be correct now

210
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,320
let's see if anyone can come up with how

211
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,079
from

212
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,640
D I came up with

213
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,880
two the two different pitches that's one

214
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,200
good way to do it um I'm glad I I hit

215
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,920
the same pitch each time maybe I'm close

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,240
um that's not the reason why I was

217
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:31,000
thinking yeah it's like the trol trevolo

218
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,440
yeah it was something like I know well

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,360
don't know what thing we're in but yeah

220
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,680
I was thinking it has something like

221
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,320
that or actually would be measured

222
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,320
tremolo wouldn't it be

223
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:50,760
like anyone know this sign where you

224
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,360
have a beamed or no just one beam right

225
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,600
two beamed dotted half notes you see it

226
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,560
everywhere every once a while when

227
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,600
you're playing like POF off or or uh or

228
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,200
shert and stuff and I always like oh I

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,200
have to remember what that is but that

230
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,519
means fill in the space of one dotted

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,680
half note with as many eighth notes as

232
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,320
it takes to fill it in alternating

233
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,320
between the top one and the bottom

234
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:22,120
one and

235
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:25,760
clap I thought a note to me had to have

236
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,399
some sort of specifiable

237
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:33,920
pitch so I count zero

238
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:39,120
now everything that somebody said uh one

239
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,920
for for this or infinite are all valid

240
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,839
definitions of what we're going to be

241
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,160
talking

242
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:49,120
about and here's the thing 99% of the

243
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,920
time when I'm not trying to set up an

244
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,519
example for um you know for kind having

245
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
fun in the first week of class with you

246
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
all uh there's no way I would call that

247
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,320
second one four notes right I mean if I

248
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,200
hear it I'm going to be one

249
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,480
so one of the things that's going to

250
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:09,680
come up quite often is that depending on

251
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,839
what purpose you want to do with

252
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,040
something you're not going to be able to

253
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,040
um necessarily even know how many notes

254
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,240
or how many of something there is let

255
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,880
alone what's the correct spelling of

256
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,760
something or not

257
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,120
um so I think we're just going to be

258
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,600
playing around with something like this

259
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,320
now go back to your definitions of notes

260
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,800
that you had before and let's grab into

261
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,959
groups of four so your two groups that

262
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,800
are the same joining with a group behind

263
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,800
you so that's we're going to get good

264
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,399
spinning over here we'll create a group

265
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,279
of three here and three here and we'll

266
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,000
we'll break up uh this this group and

267
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:54,240
talk about what your definitions of the

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,480
notes were with the other group and then

269
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,360
try to figure out a if you had correct

270
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,160
definitions or if you had compatible not

271
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,760
a correct definition compatible

272
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,839
definitions of notes before that with

273
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,360
each other's group and then also if you

274
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,480
want to change definition based on all

275
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,560
the weird numbers that we came up with

276
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,800
here so go ahead and let's take a couple

277
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,360
minutes to do that great let's let's all

278
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,360
come back together

279
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
and

280
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,480
um there was one word that I just kept

281
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,480
hearing as I was going around and it

282
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,600
begins like this I want any any group

283
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,320
use a word that begins with this in

284
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,480
their

285
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,519
definition yeah John go ahead

286
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,519
representation representation

287
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:56,120
yeah so we can kind of start with

288
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:59,320
a is

289
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,160
uh of

290
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,639
is any anybody's definition um

291
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,079
completely incompatible with this

292
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,600
opening like couldn't be put in is no

293
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,199
smile of thing okay so what are some of

294
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:17,920
the ways that your groups could have um

295
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,720
could have uh done this I didn't think I

296
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,160
heard um because it's physically

297
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,800
difficult what uh Jonathan Kara Jordan

298
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,199
and Misha's group um came up with what

299
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,880
do you How would how would somebody in

300
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,199
this group uh continue that uh everybody

301
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,279
has oh you guys are all normally

302
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:40,079
distributed names so I've heard from

303
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:44,800
everybody so um would you like

304
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,800
to is a representation of

305
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,160
anything with a

306
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,160
pitch and

307
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:01,040
duration I groups disagree with that

308
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,839
yeah so I'm coming at this from the

309
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,600
percussion perspective where a note

310
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,920
doesn't necessarily need a pitch and it

311
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,320
doesn't necessarily need a duration okay

312
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,399
so so we have um not necessarily on that

313
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,440
so do you have a positive did your group

314
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,680
come up with a positive

315
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,320
um uh definition from that I don't think

316
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,959
our group came into agreement good let's

317
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,360
hear something is a note as a

318
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,279
representation of an instance of stri in

319
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,600
something an instance of striking

320
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,600
something okay anybody

321
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:44,720
um so it's Matthew anybody um want

322
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:47,880
to want to um go

323
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,480
forward with that like sorry I can't

324
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,680
talk and write something else at the

325
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,959
same

326
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:00,519
time

327
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:02,759
anybody's that's um perfect to for out

328
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:04,959
things while you're speaking uh anything

329
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,920
with a pitch and a duration I think an

330
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,399
airplane on a airline flight has its

331
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,199
pitch and duration right so we I'll

332
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,360
start calling them Notes too no I'm just

333
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,959
just having fun just trying to just

334
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,480
trying to get us to think so we can

335
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,040
start making things how we're going to

336
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,720
make this happen for a computer I I like

337
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,560
both of these an instance of striking

338
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,600
something so yeah I feel like that

339
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,600
doesn't really apply to certain

340
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,959
instruments like violence for example

341
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,759
you don't have to anything to issue next

342
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:38,000
not

343
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,680
good so it's somebody who hasn't spoken

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,519
want to defend an instance of striking

345
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,319
something as applying to the

346
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,360
violin yeah go ahead Vanessa so I mean

347
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:50,480
if you want to be annoying you can use

348
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,920
like a version of striking in a much

349
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,399
more General sense necessarily be like

350
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,800
hitting anything just be when you're

351
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,240
moving a bow across strings you can say

352
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,600
that that counts as like a form of

353
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,759
striking even if it's not like the most

354
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,000
straightforward definition okay about a

355
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,000
wind

356
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,959
instrument

357
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,079
okay who's you y all most of you are are

358
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,760
Juniors and seniors and things so y all

359
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,280
most of you all have gotten through your

360
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,280
um physics mechanics uh General

361
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,799
Institute requirement anybody want to

362
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,799
say how do what's how's sound

363
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:33,080
produced or perceived maybe moving

364
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,400
vibrations of air vibrations of air good

365
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,919
and and so there's a lot of air

366
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,679
vibrating way way down the street why

367
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,440
why do I not hear

368
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,280
it the inverse Square law yes that might

369
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,919
that might be but what what is not

370
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,559
happening with the movement of air it's

371
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,240
not reaching our ears it's not reaching

372
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,720
our ears it's

373
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,280
not what what what is the what is one of

374
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,039
the first thing it reaches in our ears e

375
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,480
drum ear drum oh so maybe there is a way

376
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:11,080
so we could say an instance of something

377
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,240
striking something um such as air

378
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,240
striking a

379
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,360
drum

380
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,440
before half an hour of you ago how many

381
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,440
of you would have said that that's a

382
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
note

383
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,919
what's it

384
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,039
striking it doesn't need a strike you

385
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,880
said it's a representation of oh it's a

386
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,039
representation of something striking

387
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,760
good good okay any other things that we

388
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:49,159
want to do with confusing confusing

389
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,919
definitions before we get to the one of

390
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,679
the points of this

391
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:57,320
class any other really um great

392
00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:00,320
beautiful things that wasn't covered

393
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
here

394
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,039
by the way I I forgot to do this part on

395
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,039
there

396
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,679
um how many

397
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:21,600
notes okay so if there's something when

398
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,080
you play that the three different sounds

399
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,440
being done could be considered three

400
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:30,280
different notes so is a chord a note or

401
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,960
is a chord a bunch of notes not or is a

402
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,960
chord something

403
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,600
else I'd say this because we're going to

404
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,960
spend the a lot of the first problem set

405
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,400
in the next week is going to be on how

406
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,320
to represent music for the computers for

407
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:52,200
the computers as as

408
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:54,640
1960s for a computer so how do we um how

409
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,080
do what kinds of choices will lead us

410
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,880
into bad places fastest and which Ones

411
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,799
Will Keep Us in good and useful places

412
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,919
for the longest amount of time notice I

413
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,240
didn't say which ones will never lead

414
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,720
you astray because you're always every

415
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,600
definition that you're going to encode

416
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,320
into a computer at some point is going

417
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,960
to completely screw up something for

418
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,520
instance

419
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,280
um we might say one

420
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,280
note add a little ornament to

421
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,960
it still one note in some certain senses

422
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,679
but y that kind of turn can really

423
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,080
change everything so those are going to

424
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,880
be coming up over and over and over

425
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,720
again how to represent for a computer

426
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,919
and whether or not any one

427
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,520
representation is going to work um

428
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,760
somebody said a note is a representation

429
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:53,280
of anything with a pitch and a

430
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,520
duration um there are some people who

431
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,880
use the term note and the term pitch

432
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,039
absolutely interchangeably

433
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,559
and I do it sometimes also you what

434
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,120
pitch was that what note what note did

435
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:12,840
you play um things and other people use

436
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:16,080
a note to mean the pitch and the

437
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,960
duration as two different

438
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,400
entities now

439
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,840
obviously that also leads to certain

440
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,679
contradictions I would hope that we

441
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,080
think that an eighth note is a

442
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,240
note right I mean it has the word note

443
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,120
in its name we're not we're not talking

444
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,320
about uh Quavers in in Britain I mean at

445
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,240
least here in good old us OFA we put the

446
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,240
word note in our eighth notes but by

447
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,679
this definition pitch and duration and

448
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,480
eighth note itself is not a

449
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,520
note because it doesn't have a pitch so

450
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
we're going to be finding that we're

451
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,120
going to going back and forth quite

452
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,279
often now let's um your problem set is

453
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,559
going to be dealing with certain

454
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,600
representations of pitch at least the

455
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:03,840
non duration part of something I I will

456
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,760
say uh I some will pop ahead when when

457
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,520
the um when the lecture is getting too

458
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,600
cerebral and things like that um in

459
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,120
music 21 the software we're going to be

460
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:17,320
using quite often this is probably the

461
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,600
best closest definition to how music 21

462
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,640
Associates um things it's something with

463
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,880
a conceived of single pitch and it

464
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,159
conceived of single

465
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,159
duration and that might mean that

466
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,760
something like this is conceived of as

467
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,760
having a single pitch

468
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,679
or this is conceived of as having a

469
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,039
single pitch that's a Trill sign um but

470
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,480
there are other times when we don't

471
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,200
conceive of something as a single pitch

472
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,080
um and duration so let's talk about

473
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,200
representations of duration so we've

474
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:56,039
gone from the trick questions and now um

475
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,880
now I hope I haven't like uh ended your

476
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,279
faith in humanity in the class now I

477
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,520
want to go to some a little bit um more

478
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,720
thinking about standard situations and

479
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,480
not weird tremolos and gandos and all

480
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,520
that stuff um want to think about how

481
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,480
are some ways you might represent pitch

482
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,480
uh duration for a

483
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,559
computer and we'll

484
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,760
say um

485
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:35,120
I'm going to put the term here

486
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,520
musical as if somehow there's a

487
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,640
different world of time in music than

488
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,919
there is in everywhere else it's sort of

489
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,880
there's three kinds of time in the world

490
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,320
there's one on your clock there's one on

491
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
music and there's the one they teach you

492
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,480
about in relativity class that you hope

493
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,120
you never hear again right um so

494
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
thinking about this what are some ways

495
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,679
that you might do I think we've we've

496
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,120
grouped enough I think people want to be

497
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,000
able to shout and some people whose

498
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,919
names are toward the beginning and end

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,679
of the alphabet might want to be able to

500
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,559
say so what are some of the things that

501
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,799
a musical duration representation might

502
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,679
include okay I think that's that's good

503
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,279
enough I I I think it's it's sort of

504
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,039
like doing jumping jacks you just you

505
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,120
know sort of get get the thinking

506
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,559
calisthenics going so um what what's

507
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,120
some of the things that you might do for

508
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,480
representing duration Jordan said saying

509
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,679
yeah yeah like seconds or seconds good

510
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,760
now let's think about it um

511
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,120
we we'll make our default assumption for

512
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,480
this class that we're thinking in Python

513
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,039
of course obviously any halfway decent

514
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
programming language can go for another

515
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,559
so how are we going to represent seconds

516
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,240
for a note yeah go ahead oh was that I

517
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,640
guess like typically don't we use like

518
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,120
TI and that kind of like well we'll get

519
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,200
to that keep that word there for a

520
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,080
second great but what kind of um what

521
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,640
kind of is string a good

522
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,559
one array how are we going to represent

523
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,840
seconds yeah go ahead like a float float

524
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,840
okay

525
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,440
good why not

526
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,080
int yeah just shout out yep go ahead

527
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,000
because we can have in between like good

528
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,120
good we can have in between great super

529
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,760
um other other things I'm going to uh

530
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,880
other things you might want ways you

531
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,799
might want to represent

532
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,120
duration yeah go ahead Matthew fraction

533
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:30,039
fraction good that fractions seconds as

534
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:32,080
a fraction or or so thinking both uh

535
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,760
represent section seconds as a fraction

536
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,799
instead of a float so you don't have the

537
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,440
Precision issues of a float uh um I also

538
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,279
think it might make sense to represent

539
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,799
it as a beat and fr okay okay well okay

540
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,399
we go that's that's two things we have

541
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,320
beat there good good we'll keep keep

542
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:50,039
going what are some other things CU um

543
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,399
that we might do yeah I was also

544
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,840
thinking fraction but like fraction of

545
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:56,799
whatever measure you're looking at

546
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,320
fraction of measure so if you have like

547
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,120
a three four

548
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:06,080
measure and you had a half note that

549
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,480
would be 2/3 of the yep okay so good 2/3

550
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,679
that's a particular place where the

551
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,159
difference between float accuracy and

552
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,720
fraction uh came can can be very very

553
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:19,159
important good our beat and fraction of

554
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,720
measure um basically saying the same

555
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,080
thing uh with a reciprocal relationship

556
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,559
can somebody come up with a reason not

557
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,880
to yess I mean not necessarily because

558
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,440
like something could be on the second

559
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,559
beat and have like a duration of one or

560
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,440
it could be a second beat and have a

561
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,080
duration of Two And if it was a fraction

562
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,600
of a measure their values would be okay

563
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:44,440
good so we have beat as in what beat is

564
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,679
it on and and that would be very

565
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,520
different um if we thinking about how

566
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,360
many beats does it last though because

567
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,360
so thank you Vanessa fantastic um is

568
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,159
that basically the same as what fraction

569
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,559
of the measure is

570
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,520
it thank I see Matthew but I want to

571
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,720
want to get I think I'm going this way

572
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,240
cuz I'm camera shy uh so let me let me

573
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,279
lean in over here see if there's things

574
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,039
are anyone want to who who says it's

575
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,640
basically the same

576
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,880
thing and we can go all the whole room

577
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,880
who says it's it's it's could be quite

578
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,559
different okay go ahead I guess it was

579
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,399
like depends on what you define the beat

580
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,480
as so it's like 58 time or something oh

581
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:32,399
okay so five eight we'll say we'll do it

582
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,840
as this I don't know if people know that

583
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,840
symbol um

584
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:46,960
so how many beats does this

585
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:49,880
get two in some ways and how many this

586
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,519
one three good and now give me another

587
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,640
number that we could use instead of that

588
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:57,440
for a lot of five8 yeah 106 106 yeah we

589
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,000
could we could do any other good good we

590
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,399
have an infinite number of non-reduced

591
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,519
fractions we can do great I love that

592
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,519
that um how about

593
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:14,960
this no I won't write that yet

594
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,960
um how many beats does this

595
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:23,440
get three three is a good answer and

596
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:27,600
there's another good answer one one from

597
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,120
one one two right so how many beats does

598
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,120
this get

599
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,679
so there's some ways of doing it when I

600
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,039
put this symbol I'm saying I'm going to

601
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:43,039
go one one two one two and they're

602
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,880
they're not so a beat can actually

603
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,360
change its length during a measure in

604
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,039
some representation so this this is one

605
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,200
of the ways I was thinking not exactly

606
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,039
the same same thing but pretty pretty

607
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,640
close good let's see what are some other

608
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,600
ways we might represent duration for a

609
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,840
computer

610
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm going to go back to the uh in just a

611
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,600
little bit the um the names the some of

612
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,480
the things I've heard otherwise I heard

613
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:15,799
I heard something over here that um I

614
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,799
think I think Adam or say one of you

615
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,480
Derek like an attribute like a DOT is

616
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:24,039
like an attribute great so we might keep

617
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,399
cheack of attributes like how many dots

618
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,880
does it

619
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:30,039
have good anything else like that thank

620
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,039
you

621
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,840
super yeah yeah you take a number for

622
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,720
the nth note it is so if it's an eighth

623
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,720
note you say eight okay dots would be an

624
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,840
eight dot eight okay so we can represent

625
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,240
it as now

626
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,039
um eight dot works pretty well as a

627
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,360
float but is there another way we might

628
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,760
consider that if we're talking it works

629
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,960
well as a string it works better as a

630
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,080
string right because eight dot dot

631
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,200
suddenly you're you're kind of getting a

632
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,679
crash error right so that's one way you

633
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,360
can do it um other

634
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,399
ways and then so we would say 16 dot or

635
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,799
something like that good good what are

636
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,840
other attributes we might want to

637
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:10,000
represent to talk about the duration of

638
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,000
a

639
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,320
note are all notes um yeah you could you

640
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,159
could also have things in the triplet

641
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,159
you could have things in the

642
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,480
triplet yeah

643
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,240
good you can also have things in a

644
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,279
quintuplet right see if I can squeeze

645
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,559
this

646
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,559
in and you can also have

647
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,799
things in a triplet within a

648
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,639
quintuplet this is called nested tuplets

649
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,440
um

650
00:30:54,639 --> 00:31:01,480
so I will guarantee you I have seen at

651
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,440
least 20 representations of notated

652
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,080
durations where the tuplet was

653
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,320
originally created as an attribute and

654
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,720
then it needed to be represented as a

655
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,880
list array uh tupple something like that

656
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,120
of a tupple of tuplets try to say that

657
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,600
10 times fast um for a indeterminate

658
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,960
number of tuplets that might be applied

659
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,600
to a certain notes so these might be

660
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,360
certain things good uh anything else

661
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,880
that we might use to represent duration

662
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:38,080
yeah go ahead certain markings like

663
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:41,120
Stato or like good so we might have um

664
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,080
modifying Ying uh I don't know

665
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,200
articulations and expressions or

666
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,080
markings well it's called markings

667
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,159
because who knows what they are

668
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,200
markings I'll make a formada on my eye

669
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,480
good so um yeah we have our dots

670
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,200
maybe more defin

671
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,600
good so we can think of tudos that those

672
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,559
affect the duration great now I don't

673
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:12,720
want to um go too much further on this

674
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:15,919
um now our music is on uh I was going to

675
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,440
use obsolete formats a CD or streaming

676
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,480
what are the most um useful

677
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,480
representations of

678
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,440
duration of notes let's

679
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:30,880
say or other things which ones of these

680
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,880
are most

681
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,519
useful yeah I've heard you a couple

682
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,080
times from you so great super Ms got it

683
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,080
who else got

684
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,039
one is this a great duration that you a

685
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,559
representation that you're hearing of

686
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,159
the duration of a note when you're

687
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,159
listening to streaming

688
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,399
music maybe not but but boy that could

689
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,399
be useful for other things what about

690
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,159
seconds that's going to depend

691
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,960
on let's say you're listening just for

692
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,240
fun seconds very good no maybe not I

693
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,799
don't I don't usually hear seconds but

694
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,600
who's somebody who involved in the

695
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,600
streaming music process who might really

696
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,600
care about seconds of

697
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:28,639
notes I guess like computers the

698
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,200
computers why yep and and but what kind

699
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:32,399
of human might might be really

700
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,600
interested yeah some editor person the

701
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,960
editor yeah the um the person who's

702
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,279
doing the recording editing they're

703
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,080
always going to be thinking about uh

704
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:46,080
okay let's clip from 22.4 6 to 22.0 48

705
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,760
when somebody coughed and will will'll

706
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,679
come up with something right so those

707
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,880
types of things come up quite a bit in

708
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,240
in that type of World um now what if

709
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,720
we're um you've written your Great Piece

710
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,039
it's already been recorded performed and

711
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,200
things and now youve send it off to your

712
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,240
sheet music publisher what are the ones

713
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,240
they're going to Care the most

714
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,240
about's some what's a representation

715
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,760
yeah John PCH dur duration the pitch and

716
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,480
the duration good and how are they going

717
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,960
to be thinking about duration how's the

718
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,480
engraver um that's the person who who

719
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,320
makes musical scores the term for that

720
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,040
um what's what's the engraver what's she

721
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,200
going to be um thinking about in terms

722
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,200
of

723
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,520
duration what do you think about when

724
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,520
you when you're looking at musical score

725
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,599
yeah um the beat and the modifying the

726
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,560
beats the modifi good good the um what

727
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,040
do what are we going to call something

728
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,960
uh the difference between an eighth note

729
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,440
a quarter note a half note St all that

730
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,040
stuff what do what do we want to call

731
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,560
that do we we all have been doing music

732
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,640
for a very long time we all must know

733
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,640
the term for that

734
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:06,440
right there is no generalized term for

735
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,440
it so what do we want to call it in this

736
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,200
class somebody shout out something or

737
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,240
we'll call it the the the note animal

738
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,280
what what animal is this note or what

739
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,359
flavor is this note that's a good one

740
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,040
actually I wish I had gone with that um

741
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:30,320
16th notes are really really tasty

742
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,320
today anybody have a suggestion of a

743
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,280
term Essence the essence what essence of

744
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,560
note is good good I will tell you that

745
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,040
Essence is better than animal probably

746
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,320
as a term it's probably better than

747
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,720
flavor and it's better than what all the

748
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,720
rest of us didn't say because the first

749
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,280
thing you have to do when you're

750
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,280
representing for a computer is come up

751
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,680
with a name for everything yeah Vanessa

752
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,800
oh no okay but come up with a name for

753
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,079
it what duration the duration okay so we

754
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,800
might have the duration of a duration is

755
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,960
a quarter and the number of dots is two

756
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:10,200
a lot of representations do that the um

757
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,000
I think Mei calls that part A duration

758
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,240
so that's a very good term for it other

759
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,240
other

760
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,960
terms get good at naming things come up

761
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,119
with names fast in this class so let's

762
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,640
let's just pepper pepper some pepper

763
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,480
some bad names for it Jonathan what's

764
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,160
what's that almond the Almond what

765
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:36,720
Almond is it I

766
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,760
think I mean I the length what length

767
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,200
good what length does that not it's a

768
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,280
quarter note what length does that know

769
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,480
it's an eth note there might be a better

770
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,119
term but that's a pretty good one that's

771
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,119
good yeah I feel like span isn't what

772
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:54,040
span I like that what span I it might

773
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,119
not be so so perfect but you know it's

774
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,880
it gets us when you think think about

775
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,599
things what's something that expands um

776
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,640
things that people uh spend a lot of

777
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,960
time especially what course three uh

778
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,960
thinking

779
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,680
about bridges good and when you start

780
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,240
thinking about bridges what's something

781
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,119
that we haven't even thought of that

782
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,400
looks like a bridge when we think about

783
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:20,640
durations and notes slurs slurs ties

784
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,720
good slurs ties I was also thinking of

785
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,760
beams any of those good so start when we

786
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,880
start thinking of terms like this we

787
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,920
start thinking of cases who had thought

788
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,079
about ties and slurs in your

789
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,680
definition who had thought about

790
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,839
Beams I I hadn't thought of TI and so

791
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,440
when we do these types of things

792
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,040
suddenly why something is a good name or

793
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,280
might not be a good name can help us

794
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,640
think about what other things we're

795
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,760
going to have to represent I'm looking

796
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,200
at the time we're not going to be able

797
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,560
to get through all the different types

798
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,560
of representations here but but good now

799
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,319
what would it

800
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,319
take let's say you have

801
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,880
this what's it going to take that's a

802
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:08,800
dotted quarter note that's not a not a

803
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,640
trick question what's it going to take

804
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,960
for you to figure out how many seconds

805
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,839
that is who has performed music from

806
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,680
sheet music in this class in your life

807
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:18,920
okay it's basically

808
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,480
everybody so when you do that you have

809
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,760
to decide how long you're going to play

810
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,440
that right you might not even be

811
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,000
thinking it in your head I've never been

812
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,520
like okay I'm going to play that for3 3

813
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,240
six5

814
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,800
seconds um how do we how do we go from

815
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:39,000
this to a number of

816
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,839
seconds yeah good oh sorry there was two

817
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,839
in a row going behind first U well it's

818
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,319
based off the tempo based off the tempo

819
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,599
good has Tempo been included I suppose

820
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:52,800
it's almost implicitly included in beat

821
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:56,040
but Tempo is this particular term so we

822
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,599
have Tempo how do we measure tempos

823
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,240
Tempe Tempe

824
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:05,079
what's that be beat per minute

825
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,440
good beat per

826
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,240
minute so what do we need to know also

827
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,440
in addition to Tempo in order to figure

828
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,440
out how many beats something

829
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,079
is we all think of 44 right so yeah Jake

830
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,040
you intentionally say 365 because it's

831
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,319
38 of

832
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,520
the7 375 but yeah whatever I I don't

833
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:28,680
know it was something something like

834
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,760
that yeah I I I I very rarely do

835
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,599
anything intentionally so so maybe it's

836
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,800
karma um uh what do we need to do to get

837
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:41,640
beats per minute how many beats is

838
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,079
this depends depends good depends on the

839
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,040
everybody shout it out time signature

840
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,920
good so suddenly moving from this

841
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,119
representation of notes to seconds we

842
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,160
need Tempo in beats per minute and a

843
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,040
time

844
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,640
signature

845
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,040
good let me give you another one what if

846
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,880
I said the tempo here

847
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,240
was

848
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:10,720
Alro ma non

849
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,920
tropo okay the other thing if it gets

850
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,599
too much longer than that the other

851
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:18,200
thing we need is an Italian dictionary

852
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:21,480
right U algro but not too Allegro not

853
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:26,920
too much um so what do we need also in

854
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,920
order to convert this to seconds

855
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,599
let's take a take a stab at it you guys

856
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,839
have all been speaking pretty well

857
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,720
Hannah I don't think I've heard from you

858
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:40,200
in a little bit what would you say you

859
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,640
need in order to convert this to I say

860
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,880
knowledge of

861
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:49,160
what knowledge of like what it means in

862
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,720
terms of the temp knowledge of good

863
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,920
knowledge of a conversion do can you

864
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,839
give me a conversion maybe what it means

865
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:02,599
what it a conversion to let's say

866
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:04,480
BPM what would be uh what's somebody uh

867
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,800
Hannah if you want to or pass it along

868
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,400
to somebody else take stab what are you

869
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,319
going to name

870
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,319
that algro

871
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:23,599
approximately seven no okay two million

872
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:28,880
no okay good we we're we're narrowing it

873
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:32,480
down uhbe around like 110 110

874
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,839
good anybody want to go higher than 110

875
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,599
what do you want to go with 126

876
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:40,960
126 very specific number um any anyone

877
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,960
want to go

878
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:46,359
lower I'm going to go a little bit lower

879
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,359
and say

880
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:54,359
90 because the other thing that you need

881
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:58,240
to know is the cultural

882
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:59,960
context and

883
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,400
because each of these

884
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:09,040
things changes so much handle has a

885
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,040
Tempo marking of Allegro

886
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,920
Adagio what does that mean those are

887
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,800
like contradictions that's like you know

888
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,359
how how do you like your cereal I like a

889
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,040
hot cold um yeah but at a particular

890
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,599
time that is so sometimes we ignore

891
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,920
quite a lot of these right uh I know I

892
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:31,119
use uh and by the way Han I pretty close

893
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,319
I think I use 118 in a lookup table when

894
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,680
I have no idea what I want to do from

895
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:39,319
Allegro um or sometimes I've used 126

896
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:42,040
I've used other things 110 110 I usually

897
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:44,040
use as the the it depends on whether or

898
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,520
not I have a conception of the term Alig

899
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,599
gretto in which case I need to make room

900
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,280
for that but yeah 11's also very good uh

901
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,000
good by the way every guess that people

902
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,800
are doing has been really really really

903
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,599
good in this class so just just keep

904
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,599
taking the guess and I'll when we start

905
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:00,720
talking too much then I'll you know then

906
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,480
I'll I'll slow it down but good so these

907
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,680
are all the various things that we might

908
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,400
do to convert from one to another um

909
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,800
there was one other Tempo um uh one

910
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,480
other way that we could measure duration

911
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,800
that I think uh Marlin said um that I

912
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,839
was like sh not yet not yet not yet but

913
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,440
comes very important do you remember

914
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:23,280
what we said tick ticks good so you can

915
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,440
measure on the number of bugs that get

916
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,280
into your hair when you go hiking right

917
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,280
no what do we what do we mean by a tick

918
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,559
this has a different meaning than from

919
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,920
my understanding is how like the

920
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,960
computers process like whatever program

921
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,079
or application and that me kind of like

922
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,240
tis and so that kind of dictates how

923
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,280
what a second is based on great yeah so

924
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,240
what we can do is we can think of time

925
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,319
as somehow

926
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,720
discreet that time moves forward and by

927
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,960
the way there's some there's some uh

928
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,280
theoretical physicists who've been uh

929
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,640
trying to study whether time actually is

930
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,559
discrete and moves forward in know 10 to

931
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,280
the Nega

932
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:04,559
58 seconds or not um but but that we can

933
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:09,240
think of musical time as a screet number

934
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:11,920
of something in a purely computer world

935
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:16,359
like

936
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:19,440
tix which is both brilliant and a way of

937
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:21,240
just um shuffling later to some other

938
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,760
later part of the program the actual

939
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,040
conversion of this to seconds or to

940
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,400
quarter notes or to eighth notes or

941
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,480
anything like that

942
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,079
um but it's very very useful the one um

943
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,720
thing that you term that you may have

944
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:38,280
heard of before midi the midi file

945
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:41,800
format the midi things midi tends to

946
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,400
measure everything in ticks um there's

947
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,720
there's some some things are not and

948
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,480
it's a little bit of a simplification so

949
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:53,680
ticks end up being sort of ticks per

950
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:55,520
second or ticks per tick per second is a

951
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,040
pretty good one for Tempo and the other

952
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,040
one ticks per

953
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,000
per per quarter note comes up quite a

954
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,559
lot

955
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,520
um

956
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,800
intriguingly because of the problem of

957
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,800
68 and 5'8 and these weird things um

958
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,760
measure fundamental measurements in

959
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:24,119
terms of Beats have not primarily been

960
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:27,480
taken on by um by comp by people who do

961
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:30,040
um musical representation it's generally

962
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,440
seen as a slightly higher representation

963
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,160
which is ironic because it's one of our

964
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,520
fundamental ones for as musicians right

965
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,880
me you think of that oh that lasts half

966
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,400
note it lasts two beats right and then

967
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,960
somebody reminds you oh what about cut

968
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,760
timeing like uh you ruin everything

969
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,119
right you know because we generally do

970
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:54,640
some things like this

971
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:57,640
um I will share now what um I ended up

972
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,559
in my program in music 21 deciding

973
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:03,880
that for some reason the quarter

974
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:07,280
note is the fundamental measure of

975
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:10,960
everything else so that um everything

976
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,760
send to get measured in quarter

977
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,520
lengths which is a terrible term boy I

978
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,760
wish I had come up with something better

979
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,839
uh Essence that's almonds I wish I had

980
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,079
measured in Almond because quarter

981
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,160
length takes a very long time to type

982
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,160
with the camel case in the middle um and

983
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:31,280
and we didn't have uh what is it get

984
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,960
GitHub autopilot and things like that um

985
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,480
um yeah by the way I didn't mean to put

986
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,000
um no chat GPT on the syllabus I put it

987
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,520
on uh the thing later today you have fun

988
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,079
with it but not when we're doing any

989
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,720
sort of um writing your essay or

990
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,160
anything like that but we maybe we'll

991
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,280
come up with a music a chat music or

992
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,520
something later on the semester and try

993
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,640
to see how we can um do things like that

994
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,920
but yeah uh I wish I had come up with a

995
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,559
better thing but almost everything

996
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,359
measured in quarter lengths what's nice

997
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:03,599
about that is how many quarter lengths

998
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:06,160
is a quarter

999
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,640
note one one good good good we're all

1000
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,760
we're all still awake I know it's Friday

1001
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,200
late and things but yeah so I don't um

1002
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,040
what how many quarter lengths is a

1003
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,800
quarter note in

1004
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,920
68 one one how many quarter lengths is a

1005
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,920
quarter note in algro one so so these

1006
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,240
things but then how many seconds is

1007
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,119
something that's 1.5 quarter lengths ah

1008
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,079
now you have to keep up with everything

1009
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,599
so you can kind of think about when

1010
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,160
you're thinking about now let's get to

1011
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,880
the first word in this class it's not

1012
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,760
representational music theory it's

1013
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,000
computational when you're starting to

1014
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,000
think

1015
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:46,200
about I'll abbreviate it quite often as

1016
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:49,200
Q L um

1017
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,200
to

1018
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,520
SEC and maybe we'll say sex are floats

1019
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,440
in this case

1020
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,480
case uh I've use a lot of typed python

1021
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,359
by the way where if you haven't ever

1022
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,280
seen this um you'll put put this in to

1023
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:12,000
say what I expect to do so it's sort of

1024
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,880
you know the uh you know all the all the

1025
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,839
um all the joys of having to type more

1026
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,040
things without type safety um it's not

1027
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,119
so good but what do we want to put in as

1028
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,760
our attribute or attributes here we're

1029
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:27,319
going to return a

1030
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:30,319
float what's the first thing that we

1031
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:33,920
that we need ql to

1032
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:36,960
seconds many how many qls yeah so maybe

1033
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,440
it'll be ql some people like to do ql in

1034
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,200
and that's going to be measured in what

1035
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,400
do we want to make

1036
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,960
that

1037
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,359
float good could be a float in probably

1038
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,960
not good enough name something not

1039
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:57,440
representational um as an INT in in

1040
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,720
quarter lengths eighth note good good um

1041
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,240
the issue I tend to sometimes use the

1042
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,119
fraction class if you haven't ever done

1043
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,960
that because uh the first time they had

1044
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,760
three uh triplets add up actually

1045
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:13,480
triplets work fine five quintuplets adds

1046
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,480
up to

1047
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,319
1.1 uh quarter notes that's um why I

1048
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,559
started moving that but floats pretty

1049
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:23,319
good good what so that's attribute one

1050
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:26,520
is that anybody want another attribute

1051
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:26,520
in there

1052
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,559
qu length seconds yes the Tempo Tempo

1053
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:36,599
good so we can define a Tempo object and

1054
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:38,720
now we're going to see um or struct or

1055
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,440
some some kind of a thing well Temple

1056
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:46,359
could be a a basic thing it could be a

1057
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,359
float right what else could it

1058
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,440
be what do we if we're not thinking

1059
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:55,520
about algro monopo as used by handle as

1060
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:58,119
opposed to uh mlon or something like

1061
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,520
that what do we

1062
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:04,200
yeah beats per minute beats per minute

1063
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:06,119
okay so we have beats per minute that's

1064
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,799
the most common one right so that's

1065
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:10,240
going to be what do how do you measure

1066
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:10,240
beats per

1067
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:18,880
minute oh sorry sorry what what how do

1068
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,680
we want to represent it float

1069
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,440
good

1070
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,200
so we passed in first thing a quarter

1071
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,319
length second thing a Tempo um is that

1072
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,359
enough

1073
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,799
why not time signature time signature in

1074
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:36,119
order to Define what what are we

1075
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:38,240
defining by the time signature how many

1076
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,359
beats in quarter length is great beats

1077
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,760
per quarter

1078
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:46,880
length so TS will measure in beats per

1079
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,960
quarter

1080
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,960
length and what do we want to make that

1081
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:58,760
also float

1082
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:02,200
good let's let's do this you don't need

1083
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:06,119
any sort of go ahead grab laptops let's

1084
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,359
Implement quarter length to

1085
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:12,319
Second let's do it as paired programming

1086
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:15,680
so we learn from each other so um the

1087
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,400
person on the left is the who who's done

1088
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,599
paired programming person on the left is

1089
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,040
the driver unless unless the person on

1090
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:25,079
the left doesn't have the thing and

1091
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:29,240
that's your your left not my left um and

1092
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:32,240
everybody else will that it's 4:34 will

1093
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,240
take about 10

1094
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:41,040
minutes okay just just just before we we

1095
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,480
continue and start going on things how

1096
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,880
many people wrote five test cases before

1097
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,480
you started how many people wrote 10

1098
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,240
test cases how many people wrote one

1099
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,240
test case one test case how many people

1100
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,640
wrote zero test cases okay this is

1101
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,599
you're going to hear this a couple times

1102
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,960
the next class and stuff and this is

1103
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:03,079
very different guys just one second you

1104
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,599
get back into it very different from a

1105
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:08,240
lot of the especially intro level CS

1106
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,559
class at MIT but because this isn't a

1107
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,440
really big established field I I I told

1108
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,480
all yall that you're really you this one

1109
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,480
of the very few classes like this right

1110
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,720
one of the really important things is

1111
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,520
writing test cases and especially

1112
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,359
looking at corner cases so get in the

1113
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,119
habit of this you're going to if I'm

1114
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:29,799
feeling nice I might give one or to test

1115
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,240
cases with correct answers on things but

1116
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:38,160
a lot of it is sit down and think at 60

1117
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:40,319
beats per minute at um 44 how many how

1118
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,680
long what's the answer for a quarter

1119
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,160
note for

1120
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:48,240
one one good least make sure your code

1121
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,920
does that before we go on so keep going

1122
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,920
try try some running and try

1123
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,400
some okay let's let's all come back

1124
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,559
together for a bit because this this

1125
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,880
isn't the problem set and I want to want

1126
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:07,720
to kind of move on and things

1127
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:11,160
what one of the terms I heard a lot um

1128
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:13,880
for uh was this one let's do a

1129
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,480
dimensional analysis or things like that

1130
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,760
for somebody who didn't use that term or

1131
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,480
who doesn't we're all coming from

1132
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,160
different backgrounds and things what's

1133
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,160
a dimensional analysis sto geometry

1134
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,240
story geometry well thank you for

1135
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,880
obviously skating for

1136
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,960
there uh we'll get you other the called

1137
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,160
what's that called stochiometry

1138
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,760
stochiometry I i' I have I I must have

1139
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,119
failed trigonometry so I didn't get to

1140
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:43,040
that one what what is

1141
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:44,960
what okay what what what what what what

1142
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,960
that mean I honestly I just learned a

1143
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,319
new word thank you that's just

1144
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,559
dimensional analysis for chemistry

1145
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:52,599
that's just dimensional analysis for

1146
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:54,599
chemistry okay good I I we remember I I

1147
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:58,559
was up the river so we didn't we didn't

1148
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:59,680
learn these things um uh what's the um

1149
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,920
what what do we mean when we're talking

1150
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,359
about dimensional analysis yeah it's

1151
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,480
like a conversion between equivalent

1152
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:06,160
units conversion between equivalent

1153
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,680
units good what are some of dimensional

1154
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,160
analysis things you uh you've done

1155
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,799
before this

1156
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,240
class other things Yeahs physics so so

1157
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:22,119
what's what's a dimension what's kind

1158
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:24,400
try convert like um where Str is like

1159
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:25,799
meters per second like miles per hour

1160
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,799
great meters per second to miles per

1161
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:29,880
hour and absolutely thank thank you so

1162
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:33,200
we have the particular conversion there

1163
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,440
so we have meters seconds miles hours

1164
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,799
what what were some dimensionality

1165
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,400
things uh uh Dimensions that that you

1166
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,680
use now that you might not have used in

1167
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,440
your past

1168
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,160
before yeah beats quarter lengths beats

1169
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,640
per quarter length it beats quarter L

1170
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,440
quarter length per beat good beats

1171
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,839
quarter lengths absolutely um you've

1172
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,040
probably done heard beats per minute not

1173
00:54:53,839 --> 00:55:00,440
everybody has thought of it as okay then

1174
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:03,720
I have to convert to um beats

1175
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,160
per beats per second which is not

1176
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,720
something we think about we're very very

1177
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,880
good at think about beats per minute as

1178
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,760
musicians we're very very bad at think

1179
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,559
about beats per second or seconds per

1180
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,680
beat and then beats per what was the

1181
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:20,640
other thing beats per quarter

1182
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:23,039
length awesome so that came up quite a

1183
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:27,119
bit on on things going on what were some

1184
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:29,480
other things that seemed to um stump or

1185
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,960
be be fun or interesting or that you

1186
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:36,440
learned from programming this I heard a

1187
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,280
lot of we don't need the time signature

1188
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,319
I think I think I heard that aloud at

1189
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:44,559
least three or four times so but what do

1190
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:46,160
you do if you have the time signature

1191
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,839
and the problem let's say we're leaving

1192
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:53,200
out that 5'8 where the beat changes

1193
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:55,760
stuff how do we convert from um time

1194
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,799
signature let's let's think of time

1195
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:03,599
signature first as a struct as a as a

1196
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:03,599
two Tuple of numerator and

1197
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:10,680
denominator how do you convert a

1198
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,240
numerator to denominator into um beats

1199
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,240
per quarter

1200
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,400
length what is 44 how many beats per

1201
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:19,400
quarter

1202
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,599
length good what is uh

1203
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:30,640
22 how many

1204
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:33,079
beats oh good I I did I did hear it but

1205
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,599
I heard a lot of I love it this is this

1206
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:37,760
is why I'm hoping to get to his class I

1207
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:39,440
heard a lot of very loud wrong answers

1208
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,400
and then very very trickling right at

1209
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,559
the end of little whispered right answer

1210
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,640
uh how many how many beats per quarter

1211
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:51,640
length for cut time for two

1212
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:56,039
two two two and I also heard

1213
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,039
whispered somebody had

1214
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:04,960
1 12 how many beats does it take to play

1215
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:04,960
a quarter note in 2

1216
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:11,680
two how long does each of these is that

1217
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,680
correct am I wrong this

1218
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,240
time half a beat this is half a beat and

1219
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,640
it gets a quarter note this is half a

1220
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,200
beat and it gets a quarter note okay

1221
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,200
what about in

1222
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:27,319
32 half 1 half so what do what part do

1223
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,319
we not need

1224
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:31,520
need

1225
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:34,160
numerator so for this particular thing

1226
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,520
we don't need the numerator we would if

1227
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,039
we yeah go ahead Matthew don't we need

1228
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,799
the numerator in 68 do we need the

1229
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:44,599
numerator in 68 yes so what do we need

1230
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:44,599
the numerator

1231
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:53,559
four we only need the numerator to do a

1232
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,799
modulo

1233
00:57:53,559 --> 00:58:00,440
operation to see compare if it equal Z

1234
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:04,400
but is that good enough because because

1235
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:06,920
68 98 128 these all generally default in

1236
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,720
most conceptions not all but in most

1237
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:13,160
conceptions as the the number of Beats

1238
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,720
is divided by three on that so is that

1239
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,839
good enough does everyone know modulo

1240
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:20,160
notation like the remainder when divided

1241
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:25,000
by three equals zero so does that work

1242
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:28,119
68 great uh 88 nope that's a normal one

1243
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,119
98 great

1244
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:36,079
so 64 great that six how many beats does

1245
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,079
64

1246
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:45,920
have in in treated in this in this

1247
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:48,280
way two two one two one dot dot two dot

1248
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,440
dot yeah I say it has two in I one two

1249
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:54,880
three four but I I'm giving you the big

1250
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:58,160
one great so six 64 How many does 916

1251
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,839
have three three great so this this

1252
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,160
works right we've we we have all our

1253
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,400
good test cases

1254
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,680
there yeah you're smiling big anyone

1255
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,400
else smiling big you're smiling big what

1256
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:13,119
what's the test case we've missed 34

1257
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,200
34 so 34 has one

1258
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,119
beat right because you divide by three

1259
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,119
so what what do we have to

1260
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:28,039
do this if the numerator modu 3 equals

1261
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,039
0 and

1262
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,520
num not equals

1263
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:36,920
3

1264
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,720
right that's assuming we've already done

1265
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,240
our assertion that n numerator is

1266
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:46,039
positive and all the other things right

1267
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:49,480
so these are the algorithms that you

1268
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:52,400
already know in your head for music by

1269
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,400
being musicians but they are not the

1270
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,520
algorithms that you have been

1271
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:00,240
programming before here's a particular

1272
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,680
one that's that I always like to do and

1273
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,079
I don't think we're going to have time

1274
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,640
to go through it today because you guys

1275
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:09,200
have been such great participants in my

1276
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:13,520
um in my terrible uh employees and

1277
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,880
things um given a a note given a quarter

1278
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,039
note let's say we we'll keep it really

1279
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,119
simple because we're already in we'll

1280
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:20,359
call the quarter note one one quarter L

1281
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:23,920
one beat or

1282
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:28,440
something given a DOT how many

1283
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,440
beats 1.5 given two

1284
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:34,319
dots three

1285
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:36,079
dots oh somebody had is Trail off good

1286
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:39,520
end

1287
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,520
dots what is the

1288
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:47,480
formula yeah so so working this out and

1289
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,760
if you want I'll put a link online uh

1290
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,119
once I originally had to write out this

1291
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:56,000
formula because I kind of needed it it

1292
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,640
becomes kind of fun so um yeah so it and

1293
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,680
end up being uh what do you call them

1294
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,039
these are meren numbers which are not

1295
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:06,280
the same as meren primes they end up

1296
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:09,520
being um sort of n minus one uh what is

1297
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:13,160
it 2 to the N - one over 2 to the N so

1298
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:18,280
you end up one and one half slightly

1299
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:21,160
under one and 3/4 1 and 78 so 2 to the N

1300
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:24,160
whatever so you can to figure out okay

1301
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:27,119
and hopefully that works um two to the

1302
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,440
zero sorry that that goes down below

1303
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,039
that's not part of the exponent I should

1304
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:35,039
make that nicer 2 to the N minus one

1305
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,319
over 2 to the N sorry I haven't been

1306
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:40,000
writing on whiteboards in a year so My

1307
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:44,079
technique is a little low so does that

1308
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,520
does that work or one plus right yeah so

1309
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:49,359
uh does that work for zero dots what's

1310
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,520
two to the

1311
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:55,400
zeroth what's two to the Zer one one

1312
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,240
minus one is zero so that cancels that

1313
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,799
out as long as that's not zero there

1314
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:02,640
good so we get one what happens if you

1315
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,640
have a negative one

1316
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:12,160
dot 2 to the

1317
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,160
1 12 minus

1318
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,680
one2 over two to the um over 2 to

1319
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:23,799
thetive

1320
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:28,680
1 over2 and what's that end up2 over2 1

1321
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:33,160
+ 1 equal zero zero so every time you

1322
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:37,359
don't hear any music no you're hearing

1323
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,359
the grand Symphony of negative one

1324
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:43,640
dots I think that's a good place to wrap

1325
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,640
up
