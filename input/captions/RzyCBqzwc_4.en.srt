1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,160
I would like to introduce Evan H,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
co-founder and CEO of Helix Carbon.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,280
Evan, please go ahead.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,840
Thanks. Great to be here and great to

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,039
great to see a good crowd here. So, my

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
name is Evan. I'm one of the co-founders

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,359
of a company called Helix Carbon. We we

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,640
spun out of MIT with uh my co-founders

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
Ariel First who's a professor in

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,599
chemical engineering and Dave Brown who

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
was a graduate student with me to to

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
really solve one specific problem which

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,520
is the the emissions impact of the

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,559
global steel industry. I think many

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,399
people on this call are probably

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,239
familiar with this, but it's a both

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,680
enormous market and enormous in its

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,840
emissions impact, right? And the vast

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,360
majority of those emissions comes from

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,920
the very first step, which is turning

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,200
metallic iron or sorry, iron ore rather

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
into metallic iron. And and the reason

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,800
for that is the way that we do this

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,199
process today. We take in some kind of

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,199
fossil fuel. We produce what's called a

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,840
reducing gas from that fossil fuel and

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,879
use that as a chemical reagent to strip

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,080
oxygen off that iron oxide. and then

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
gets emitted as CO2 and water vapor. And

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,560
so, you know, this CO2 is really coming

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
from this upstream carbon monoxide. But

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
it's actually quite difficult to get rid

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
of that carbon monoxide because it's

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
necessary as a chemical reagent. It's

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
it's providing heat for the reaction.

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,280
It's also providing carbon which you

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,080
know good quality steel obviously has

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,159
carbon by definition. And so switching

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,439
away from carbon monoxide is quite

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,680
challenging. So, how do you decarbonize

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,680
a process that inherently requires

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,079
carbon? That's the core challenge and

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,640
why it has been so difficult to reduce

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,159
emissions in this in this industry. And

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,520
so, we came up with a bit of a different

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,600
solution, which is let's actually keep

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,119
the carbon in here, but let's close the

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,399
loop. Instead of letting that CO2 get

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,439
emitted, let's pull that entire flu gas

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,159
that includes both CO2 and water back

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,479
into our electrolyer. We selectively

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,200
reduce the CO2 back into carbon monoxide

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,960
and the water back into hydrogen for

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,360
reinjection into the shaft furnace.

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,920
Right? And so it's a closed loop carbon

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,319
neutral process. But most importantly,

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,599
it requires zero process change at the

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,599
level of the furnace. From the

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,959
perspective of the iron making furnace,

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,160
nothing is actually changing. The

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,160
chemical inputs and outputs are

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,800
identical. And so this is compatible

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,959
across most existing iron making

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,840
facilities globally in a way that there

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,520
is not a technology solution for today.

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
And so that's really our core product is

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,319
this electrolyer that can take in not

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,319
just pure CO2 but actually this dilute

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,760
mixed gas flu gas which is really

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
important for the economics here. taking

71
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,040
that in directly, selectively reducing

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,560
the spent components, the CO2 and water

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,840
back into CO and hydrogen for

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,040
reingjection through to the shaft

75
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,239
furnace. And as you might imagine, you

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,239
know, this is plenty of applications

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,360
beyond steel. And so if this rings a

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
bell to you, we're happy to chat about

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
that as well. But we really see our core

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
focus for now as in the steel industry

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
for a couple of reasons, right? This is

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
novel because it's a drop in gas mix.

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,080
It's interchangeable with fossil fuels,

84
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,760
which also allows you to tap into a

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
pretty critical piece of this, which is

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
intermittency. You can run this

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,120
alongside fossil fuels to dramatically

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,040
reduce your emissions during times of

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,840
the day when electricity is cheap and

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,480
green. But for most geographies, you

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
don't have green power 24/7. And so you

92
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,319
can flip this on and off in a way that

93
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,760
is not available to most legacy

94
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,200
solutions. And it's also very flexible,

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,959
right? You can partially decarbonize,

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,239
you can entirely decarbonize. There's

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
really a flexible slider here

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,599
operationally because of that drop in

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,760
gas mix because it's something that you

100
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,000
can integrate day one without any

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,360
changes in your process chemistry while

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,440
producing green green steel. And so what

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,040
we do is we build electrolyers that sit

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,239
on site at our customers facilities

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,720
whether they're chemical plants or

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,720
particularly obviously steel makers. We

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,319
sit on site alongside them take in their

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,840
flu gas and produce the existing

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,000
chemical feed stocks and sing gas that

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,159
these sites already use. It allows them

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
to stabilize the production of these

112
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
feed stocks and and perhaps more

113
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
importantly stabilize the price, right?

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,840
Because you can tie it instead of tying

115
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,439
it to to volatile energy markets, you

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,480
can all of a sudden tie your economics

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,560
to 20-year PPAs for power. And so it

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,239
allows you a huge level of insurance on

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,400
your cost stack as well in a pretty

120
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,519
interesting way. And and finally, it's

121
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,120
drop in, right? We're not trying to

122
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,759
change any of the chemistries. It is a

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,280
drop-in solution. But I think more

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
importantly perhaps is is the cap

125
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,040
expert. And if you're trying to

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,759
decarbonize steel making, this is by far

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,000
the lowest capex solution because it

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,560
allows you to take advantage of legacy

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
innovations in fossilbased steel making,

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
which frankly has gotten really darn

131
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,800
good. And so that's what we're trying to

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,040
do here and and build upon. So we're

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,320
here to to to to share this with all of

134
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
you and also to to look for

135
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
collaborations, right? We're ready and

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,040
building currently some pilots here in

137
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
Massachusetts, but we're excited to

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,280
build additional partnerships sort of in

139
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,199
the 100 to 100 kilogram per day range.

140
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,800
as well as joint development projects to

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
really customize and test and validate

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,440
the solution for your specific plant for

143
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,199
your specific needs. And then finally,

144
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,960
if you're a user of steel and you're

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
looking to decarbonize, we're also

146
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,160
starting to explore green steel optic

147
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,080
agreements with many of the end

148
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,440
consumers in those spaces. So if any of

149
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
these describe you, you know, please

150
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,320
reach out and we we'd love to we'd love

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,560
to discuss. Thank you, Evan. Thank you

152
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,120
so much. Again, post your questions to

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,840
the Q&A tab and we'll try to get to

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,560
that. Um, what about the cement

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,639
industry?

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Yeah, cement's good actually. Very high

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,800
concentration CO2, which is nice and so

158
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,919
that that's useful as a feed stock. The

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,000
I think the core challenge for us would

160
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,360
be what do you our whole model is we

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
produce sing gas and we want to use that

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
on site, right? And so it's for

163
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,199
industries where that is of chemical

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,440
value. And so the ones that come to mind

165
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
are really steel like we talked about.

166
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,960
There's also a broader suite like

167
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
polycarbonates, polyurethanes, acetic

168
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,280
acid, even pharmaceuticals as a broad

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,680
suite of industrial chemicals that use

170
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,360
carbon monoxide and or sin gas as a

171
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,319
chemical feed stock. And so we see those

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,080
as our as our sort of places to start um

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
before perhaps expanding to to other

174
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,039
industries as well. Absolutely. Okay.

175
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,360
Cement will definitely be of interest.

176
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,280
Um and then what is the technology on

177
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
the stack? Can you talk a little about

178
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,919
that or is that the secret sauce? It's a

179
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
little bit the secret sauce. Uh the

180
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
obviously there's there's innovations

181
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
both on the stack side, sort of the

182
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,479
design of the stack as well as on the

183
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,560
catalyst side. So the types of catalysts

184
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,319
that we're using uh one of the most

185
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,160
important pieces is resilience here. The

186
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
ability to operate in in mixed gases,

187
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,759
not just pure CO2. That's a huge

188
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,520
difference from existing systems as well

189
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,199
as to operate intermittently with with

190
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,800
no degradation. I think both of those

191
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,600
two are sort of the core technical

192
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,919
differentiators of of our system versus

193
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,840
the the current CO2 electrolyers out

194
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,800
there. Um, and I just saw Anton's

195
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,400
comment. So, uh, it's funny that you say

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,680
that. So, one of our first, uh, our

197
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,039
first partnerships is going to be at a

198
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,639
biomass pyrolysis facility. Um, but I

199
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,120
don't know if we've ever looked at bio

200
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,000
explicitly. So, I'd be happy to if you

201
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,800
want to reach out to

202
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,400
evanhelixarbon.co. I'd be more than

203
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,880
happy to chat specifically about what

204
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,080
you're envisioning. Uh, because I think,

205
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
you know, there's there's a much broader

206
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,880
suite of bio I'm I'm a chemist, right?

207
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,319
I'm not a biologist. And I think there's

208
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
a lot of those types of industries that

209
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,599
I wouldn't expect to see that have needs

210
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,680
that we can serve. Yeah. Fantastic.

211
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,840
Thank you, Evan. Thank you again, Matt

212
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
and Grace. And if you like to connect

213
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,000
with any of these startups now after

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
today, please contact your ILP program

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,319
director or us at Startup Exchange and

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,840
we'll all be able to help. Now, thanks

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
