1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,210

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,630
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,560
I'm Ernest Fraenkel, a Professor
in the Department of Biological

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,100
Engineering and Co-Director of
the interdisciplinary program

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,980
in Computational
and Systems Biology.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,440
Any of you who've walked
around Kendall Square

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,000
over the last few
years will have

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,520
noticed that the landscape
is being transformed

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,370
by an influx of companies in the
life sciences and health care.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,990
And that's no coincidence
because MIT is an engine

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,009
of innovation in those areas.

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,640
At MIT, the Life Sciences
and Health Sciences

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,530
span many departments--
obviously, biology, chemistry,

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,770
physics, and many of the
engineering departments--

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,400
my own, biological engineering,
chemical, civil, mechanical,

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,640
materials, and of
course, computer science.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,740
And we live in an
amazing ecosystem

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,080
where we also have the Broad
Institute, the Whitehead,

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,890
the many hospitals around us,
and of course, many venture

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,150
capitalists.

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,130
And that's led to,
really, a profusion

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,790
of companies emerging from MIT.

23
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,630
You can see some of them
that have biological themes

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,019
on the slide above us.

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,780
And you've seen similar
slides earlier today.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,140
And I think what strikes
me about these companies

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,470
is their diversity.

28
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,580
Everything from bionics, bionic
limbs, better diagnostics,

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,090
the platforms that accelerate
the delivery and discovery

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,570
of therapeutics.

31
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,360
So today, we have
the opportunity

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,750
to hear from two
leaders in developing

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,920
entrepreneurial companies
that are, really, while early,

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,750
still already having
an amazing impact.

35
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,245
And I'll ask them each to
introduce themselves and tell us

36
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:38,620
a little bit about
their company.

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,140
So let's start with you, Cullen.

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,900
All right.

39
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,770
Happy to be here.

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,520
Cullen Buie, I'm on the faculty
in Mechanical Engineering

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,030
and Biological Engineering.

42
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,790
The company that's spun out
of my lab is called Kytopen.

43
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,690
It's a company which is
developing a technology that

44
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,030
allows you to do
scalable gene delivery

45
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,420
into human cells for things
like CAR-T therapy and gene

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,600
therapies, ex-vivo gene therapy,
so therapies where they want

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,540
to take your cells, engineer
them, and then give them

48
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,890
back to you to serve as
a living therapeutic.

49
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,550
The beauty of the technology is
that it scales from the bench

50
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,340
to the clinic.

51
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,730
So a challenge in a
lot of these fields

52
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,040
is that the technologies
that you use for discovery

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,940
don't always scale
up to manufacturing,

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,270
but we have a technology
where the same thing that you

55
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,120
use at the bench can quickly
and easily scale up to what

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,910
you can use at the clinic.

57
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,860
So to put some
numbers to it, it can

58
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,990
do enough for a human
patient in about one minute.

59
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,210
So you could imagine easily
doing this for a large patient

60
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,290
population.

61
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:35,860
Fantastic.

62
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,760
Tasuku.

63
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,880
Hi, my name is Tasuku Kitada,
and I'm Co-Founder Head

64
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,720
of R&D at Strand Therapeutics.

65
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,530
Strand is a next-generation
messenger RNA therapeutics

66
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,120
company focused on
developing cancer drugs.

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,490
Our drugs are based
on messenger RNA.

68
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,210
We actually programmed the
mRNA using molecular sensors

69
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,610
and switches so that
we can express protein

70
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,340
in a cell-type specific manner.

71
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,310
And what that does
is that now you

72
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,250
can take really potent
proteins like cytokines

73
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,250
that might be very good
for counteracting cancers

74
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,710
but might be very systemically
toxic to the patient.

75
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,950
So now we can take that, express
it specifically in the tumor

76
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,210
so that you can take a
difficult-to-develop mechanism

77
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,660
and make it developable.

78
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,040
So I developed this technology
while I was a postdoc at MIT

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,290
at the Synthetic
Biology Center, together

80
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,540
with my business co-founder
Jake Becraft, who

81
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,550
was a student at MIT,
biological engineering,

82
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,573
and our scientific co-founders,
Ron Weiss at the Synthetic

83
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:30,990
Biology Center and
Darrell Irvine,

84
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,290
who was at the Koch
Institute at the time.

85
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,978
Fantastic.

86
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:35,520
So I'd like to hear
from each of you.

87
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,380
What inspired you
to start companies?

88
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,140
Was there a eureka
moment, or was it

89
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,130
more like Edison, one part
inspiration and 99 parts

90
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,890
perspiration?

91
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,290
Let's start with you, Tasuku.

92
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,130
Yeah.

93
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,860
Entrepreneurship for me
was very serendipitous.

94
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,040
So I didn't come to MIT
necessarily thinking

95
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,400
that I wanted to
become an entrepreneur.

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,050
But I feel like maybe I
came at the right place

97
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,700
at the right time.

98
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,300
A few years before I started
my postdoc, Katalin Karikó,

99
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,820
Drew Weissman at Penn had
developed this technology

100
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,100
that showed that you
can take messenger RNA

101
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,110
and express protein in
a very efficient manner.

102
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,460
And then Moderna
also had just became

103
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,214
a company, a startup company.

104
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,089
And they were working
on the first generation

105
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,740
of messenger RNA therapeutics.

106
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,470
And so we were in academia.

107
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,520
And while we thought
that most people were

108
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,260
skeptical about messenger
RNA therapeutics at the time,

109
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,140
maybe it was only
like a 1% chance

110
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,340
that it would become
useful for society.

111
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,280
But as academic researchers,
we can think boldly.

112
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,270
And we thought, let's imagine
a world in which this messenger

113
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,170
RNA became useful for society.

114
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,180
And in that world,
what would be missing?

115
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,600
And what we realized
was that the ability

116
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,180
to control protein
expression precisely

117
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,370
was missing for the
first-generation technologies

118
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,030
that companies like Moderna,
BioNTech were developing.

119
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,970
And so that's why
we decided to apply

120
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,790
the principles of synthetic
biology and program

121
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,970
the messenger RNA so that we can
express protein in cancer cells

122
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,100
specifically or immune
cells specifically.

123
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,080
And this was more
than 10 years ago,

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,270
way before anyone
believed in messenger RNA.

125
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,750
And so when we
presented this work,

126
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,800
most people thought it
was kind of like sci-fi.

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,310
And so I think the world
wasn't really ready yet

128
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,760
for this kind of technology.

129
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,593
So we didn't immediately
think we were going

130
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:20,480
to spin it off as a company.

131
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,640
It wasn't until
several years later,

132
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,190
when we saw that companies
like Moderna, BioNTech,

133
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,460
they were gaining financial
traction, at least,

134
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,520
thinking about IPOing.

135
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,430
And that's when we
thought that maybe,

136
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,150
maybe with these resources
behind these technologies, maybe

137
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,283
now there's a 10% chance of
success that mRNA could achieve.

138
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,950
And that's when we
spun out the company,

139
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,570
and we started in early 2019.

140
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,070
Thank you.

141
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,060
Cullen.

142
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,250
Yeah, I wish I could say
that I was two years old

143
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,990
and I wanted to start a company
on gene delivery technology.

144
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,400
And this is the fulfillment
of a lifelong dream.

145
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,040
That's not the way it happened.

146
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,020
It started for us, really,
with the grant from DARPA.

147
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,500
So I was actually excited
to hear about the new grant

148
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,200
opportunities.

149
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,680
DARPA kind of took a risk on
some technologies from my lab,

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,410
and this was 2013.

151
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,880
I hadn't worked in the space
of gene delivery at all.

152
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,400
I just had a crazy
idea, and they

153
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,150
were willing to put
some money towards it.

154
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,860
And I had a great post-doc
at the time, Paulo Garcia,

155
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,240
who became my co-founder.

156
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,240
And we developed this
technology for gene delivery.

157
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,710
And around 2016, he would
present at conferences,

158
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,090
and people would come up
to him after the talk,

159
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,122
say, this was awesome.

160
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:25,830
That was amazing.

161
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,835
Where do I buy it?

162
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:27,960
Where can I buy this thing?

163
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,600
And we're like,
oh, I don't know.

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,610
We weren't selling it.

165
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,700
It was very much we
started the company

166
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,660
to satisfy a market need.

167
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,425
We didn't get into
the space thinking

168
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,800
we were going to
start a company,

169
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,690
and then we're going
to be rich and famous.

170
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,982
That still hasn't happened yet.

171
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:43,520
[LAUGHTER]

172
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,230
We got into it because
there was a market need,

173
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,640
and we felt it was really clear
that for some research at MIT

174
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,820
and for some research, the
end of your progression

175
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,110
is publishing a paper
or a student's thesis.

176
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,890
It was really clear that in this
case, the end of this research

177
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,100
was in the marketplace.

178
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,700
It had to get out there where it
could potentially help patients.

179
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,210
And I would say
there was another--

180
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,800
there was a lot of
serendipity also in our story.

181
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
We founded the company
right around the same time

182
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,970
as the engine was being founded.

183
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,720
And so we submitted
an interest statement

184
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,105
saying we were interested in
learning more about the engine.

185
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,230
And they reached out to us.

186
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,120
I'll never forget
meeting with Katie Rae.

187
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,400
They didn't even have
offices at the time.

188
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
We met in a random
conference room at MIT

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,360
to talk about our technology.

190
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,900
And she said, I really want
to put gasoline on this

191
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,950
and accelerate it forward.

192
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,330
And they took a risk on us,
and we started the company

193
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,980
based on that kind
of market pool

194
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,580
and the interest
from the engine.

195
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,900
A fantastic story.

196
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,290
Tasuku, what
challenges did you face

197
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,910
taking your academic project
and turning it into a startup?

198
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,630
Yeah.

199
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,670
So the objective
of a company is so

200
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,470
different from
academic research.

201
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,890
As a company, we need
to be really laser

202
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,740
focused on value creation.

203
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,150
And so to me, it comes down to
company culture and the team.

204
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,250
And company culture, it seems
like such a nebulous concept,

205
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,250
but it goes hand in hand
with company strategy.

206
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,920
So what is it that
you choose to do?

207
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,950
What is it that you choose not
to do and how do you do it?

208
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,530
And so that goes hand in hand
with the company's mission.

209
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,200
And our mission
is to cure cancer.

210
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,370
And so every day, we
ask our employees,

211
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,590
what is it that you're
doing specifically

212
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,580
that creates value towards
that goal and mission of curing

213
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,080
cancer?

214
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,700
And if it doesn't really
contribute to that,

215
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,380
let's drop it.

216
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,720
And then really focus
on the activities

217
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,070
that lead to value creation.

218
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,720
And then on just setting
the company culture,

219
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,980
and the strategy isn't enough.

220
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,120
The team needs to
execute on that.

221
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,960
And so from a team
perspective, of course,

222
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,080
you need the really talented
people, the intelligent people.

223
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,060
But that's not enough.

224
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,950
You really need grit.

225
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,820
So as a startup, you're facing
crises all the time, right?

226
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,380
And it's so easy to give up.

227
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,920
So you need not just
intelligence but that grit

228
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,040
to hang in there and figure out
how to solve these problems when

229
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,750
they come.

230
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,170
But that isn't enough either.

231
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,680
You need to be a real team
player because drug development

232
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,990
is a team sport.

233
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,480
And so in the early
days, we brought

234
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,580
in a lot of talented
research scientists,

235
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,760
a lot coming from MIT as well.

236
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,790
And once we were successful
with the drug discovery

237
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,013
phase of the
company, then it was

238
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,680
time to really bring in a lot of
industry experience folks, that

239
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,847
can work on the development.

240
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:33,820
Our SVP has decades of
experience in industry

241
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,320
developing gene therapies.

242
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,660
Prashant Nambiar.

243
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,390
And then we also brought in
some folks that can really

244
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,930
manufacture the drug.

245
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,392
That's super important,
or else your drug

246
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:44,600
isn't going to be successful.

247
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,210
So Joe Barberio is
our vice president

248
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,670
of technical operations
that is really

249
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,520
experienced with lipid
nanoparticles, messenger RNA

250
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
drug development.

251
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,700
So yeah, with that, now we're
a clinical stage company.

252
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,020
And I think we're
proving out our concept

253
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,300
of taking these really
potent mechanisms

254
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,250
and curing cancer patients.

255
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,170
Cullen, as a professor,
as an academic,

256
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,420
do you encourage your students
to do entrepreneurship.

257
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,710
And if so what message
do you give them?

258
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,120
Yeah, that's a great question.

259
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,488
These days, you almost don't
need to encourage them.

260
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,280
Probably half the
students that come to you

261
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
are already interested in it.

262
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,613
So I actually spent a lot of
time discouraging students.

263
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:20,290
[LAUGHTER]

264
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,030
I think there are
two poor reasons

265
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,155
to want to start a company.

266
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,930

267
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,400
Then I'll give a good one.

268
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,200
The two bad ones that
you see, unfortunately,

269
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,480
being an entrepreneur has
become a bit glamorized,

270
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
and you can tell
that there are some

271
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
that are interested in
being an entrepreneur

272
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,580
because it's going
to sound really

273
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,390
cool to tell their friends
they're raising money.

274
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,560
That's a terrible reason
to be an entrepreneur.

275
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,230
There's a second one,
and you see this a lot.

276
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,790
And it's a hard one.

277
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,750
But people get really excited
about their technology.

278
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,750
They love their science.

279
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,100
They love their
technology. so much.

280
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,170
They just think everyone else in
the world is going to love it.

281
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,285
And the truth is that
the world doesn't

282
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:55,410
care about your technology.

283
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,702
They care about what it can do.

284
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:57,930
They care about the solution.

285
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,928
And so that gets me to the good
reason is, you need a good, why.

286
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,720
You need a good, who
are you going to help,

287
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,730
whose life is going to change by
the success of your technology

288
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,610
or of your company.

289
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,297
If you have a
compelling why, that's

290
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,380
a good reason to be an
entrepreneur because that's

291
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,047
the thing that's going
to keep you going

292
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,270
those late nights, those long
days, when you're raising money,

293
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,570
which you'll always
be raising money.

294
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,570
That's the thing that's
going to keep you going.

295
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,080
So I usually tell students
like, find a good why,

296
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,680
find a good problem.

297
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,070
That's the thing that you
want to be motivated by, not

298
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,100
by the technology.

299
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,270
The technology is nice.

300
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,895
The technology is
nice to get a degree,

301
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:34,320
but not nice for
starting a company.

302
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,630
That's a wonderful lesson
for our students here.

303
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,430
Tasuku, I understand
that you took

304
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,478
a bit of a detour between your
time at MIT and starting Strand.

305
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:43,020
Can you tell us a
little bit about it

306
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,130
and how it may have
influenced your path?

307
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,250
Yeah, and a lot of this was
really serendipitous, right?

308
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,510
It wasn't like this was
my grand plan in life.

309
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,027
So I met my wife while
I was here at MIT,

310
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:56,860
and she was a visiting
student from Belgium.

311
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,650
And so after I
finished my postdoc

312
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,550
so that I can be with
her, I moved to Europe.

313
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,250
And when I moved to
Europe, I decided

314
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,550
that getting outside of the
MIT environment, it's so hard.

315
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,380
You get spoiled with the
resources that you have here.

316
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,737
And I thought, maybe
I'll try something else.

317
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:13,320
And I joined an asset management
company, a biotech investment

318
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,350
fund, in Brussels.

319
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,380
And so I was a so-called
buy-side analyst.

320
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,620
And so we had
billions of dollars

321
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,410
of investor money invested
in public biotech and pharma

322
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,110
companies.

323
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,360
We had more than 100
companies in our portfolio.

324
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,860
And my job as an analyst was
to follow obsessively every

325
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,320
single move that these
public biotech and pharma

326
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,170
companies make.

327
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,340
And so I analyzed the platform
technologies, the pipeline

328
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,060
drugs, and all the
diseases that are

329
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,570
being pursued by the biotech
and pharma companies.

330
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,910
And so I didn't necessarily
really love that job, per se.

331
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,540
But it was so educational in
learning about what people are

332
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,470
doing in the biopharma space.

333
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,160
And as Cullen
mentioned, that helped

334
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
us think about what are
the unmet medical needs

335
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,320
that this next-generation
messenger RNA

336
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,730
technology can address?

337
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,150
And that led us to
focusing on cancer

338
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,660
and immuno-oncology using
Strand's messenger RNA

339
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,650
technology.

340
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,280
Wonderful.

341
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,863
Well, maybe this is
the last question,

342
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:12,220
given how much time we have.

343
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,730
Are there any lessons
that you learned,

344
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,480
advice that you'd give
to your former self

345
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,080
when you were just starting out?

346
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,990
Yeah, I'd probably
give myself the advice

347
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,910
I just gave all of you, which
is like, don't forget your why.

348
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,790
I think as you get
into it, you can

349
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,790
start getting distracted by
all kinds of things which

350
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,370
seem like success or seem like
milestones along the way--

351
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,240
hiring people,
finding new space,

352
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,940
raising money,
finding customers.

353
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,180
Those things are all great.

354
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,540
But don't forget
the core thing that

355
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,630
motivated you to get
into it in the beginning.

356
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,700
Think of the faces
of the people that

357
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,220
are going to be saved and
helped by what you're doing.

358
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,060
And maybe try to keep a
good connection with them.

359
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,110
In the technology that
we are working on,

360
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,640
it's a gene delivery technology.

361
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,420
And so we interact more
with customers who then

362
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,810
will interact with patients.

363
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,120
And so you can feel
a little bit removed.

364
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,090
And early on, I
think it might have

365
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,050
been helpful to just continue
to remember why you're doing it

366
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,380
and who you're doing it for.

367
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,030
Oh, that's a great message.

368
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,880
And so I want to thank
you both for, really,

369
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
a fascinating conversation.

370
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,200
I think what came out to
me in these conversations

371
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,840
with you is really that that
exemplifies what's really

372
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,088
best about MIT, people working
across disciplines, really

373
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:23,630
focused on addressing some of
the really challenging problems

374
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,463
for society, especially
in health care.

375
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,130
Let's give them a big
round of applause.

376
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,880
[APPLAUSE]

377
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,000
