1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:03,169
I remember spending several weeks in the

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,796
summer at my grandparents farm.

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,883
My father came from a small farm.

4
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,927
It's a farm that's been in the family for

5
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,178
a little over a hundred years.

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,640
And going and seeing how a working farm

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,016
works was really fun.

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,603
He's very supportive, Saskatchewan, and

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,938
part of it's because of the weather.

10
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,481
It is incredibly cold in the winter.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,859
We have a joke where I grew

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,610
up that there are four seasons.

13
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,196
Almost winter, winter, still

14
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,823
winter, and road construction.

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,206
I always had a real interest in

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,207
understanding the

17
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,585
fundamentals of science.

18
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,545
And so physics is a great part of that.

19
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,172
And I love math problems.

20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,631
I love solving a problem

21
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,883
that I hadn't seen before.

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,887
I first heard about MIT, actually from an

23
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,306
MIT alumnus who was living in Regina.

24
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,308
At the science fair, people come by to

25
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,267
see what you're doing.

26
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,852
And this is somebody who stopped by and

27
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,187
we spent some time chatting.

28
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,146
He liked my project.

29
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,106
And he told me about the Institute and

30
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,399
how much it mattered to him.

31
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,194
And that led me to then think about, oh,

32
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,196
okay, I should think about,

33
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,071
is this a place I might

34
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,740
want to go in the future?

35
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,243
Showing up in Boston for the first time

36
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,912
was a little bit of a culture shock.

37
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,288
Drivers are different here

38
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,831
than they are in Saskatchewan.

39
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,416
I would really say it was

40
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,793
the institution that drew me.

41
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,669
It was that challenge to go to a place

42
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,797
that was really world ranked

43
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,549
and see if I could survive in that place.

44
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,926
Well, it's an intense place.

45
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,803
It's a friendly place.

46
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,305
It's not highly competitive.

47
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,808
It's a place where people work together.

48
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,018
It's a place where you find colleagues

49
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,561
who help you think through a problem.

50
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,230
Talent comes from everywhere.

51
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,191
And MIT is great at leveraging that

52
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,859
talent and attracting that talent.

53
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,860
My role as Chancellor

54
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,111
for Academic Advancement,

55
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,279
I usually describe it as

56
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,656
being MIT's ambassador.

57
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,450
MIT has such an incredible

58
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,327
history of changing the world.

59
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,455
And if I can make a connection between

60
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,915
somebody from the

61
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,084
outside and a faculty member,

62
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,628
if I can create a little more support so

63
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,046
that some student can come here

64
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,090
that otherwise couldn't afford it, that's

65
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,550
a different way to make an impact.

66
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,347
So many of the challenges that we're

67
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,516
facing today are global challenges.

68
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,768
If we fix climate in the United States,

69
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,228
you don't really do it

70
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,063
because it's part of a global system.

71
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,649
Having this global perspective means that

72
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,316
we can work with

73
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,818
partners around the world.

74
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,947
What is exciting to me about MIT is this

75
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,200
communal perspective

76
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,911
on collaboratively tackling hard

77
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,746
problems, making the

78
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,539
world a better place.
