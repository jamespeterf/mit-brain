this seminar today and meet with Este

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,240
steam faculty um of MIT U the title of

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,759
my talk um ferroelectric haa and

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,439
semiconductor for frequency control

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,440
applications and uh well I like the

46
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,920
second line of my title unleashing The

47
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,080
Power of nanomechanics on chip uh

48
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,920
because we would like to talk about how

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,920
mechanics um could be uh transforming in

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,000
a lot of electronics

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,200
Microsystems talking about mechanics U

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,560
before uh the age of electronics um

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
mechanics has been dominating the world

54
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,440
of

55
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,319
engineering um so we all know mechanical

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,280
engineering uh has roots that dates back

57
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,000
all the way to en shyan times they uh

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,400
mechanical tools uh primitive tools such

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,400
as um pulley levers and wheels was

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,000
invented and enabled a whole lot of uh

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,760
engineering and diverse uh one of the

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,640
most interesting and uh to me my

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,360
favorite um highly sophisticated

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,319
mechanical systems um are these U set of

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,360
clocks or chronometers that developed by

66
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:09,519
John Harrison in 18th U

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,000
Century um at the time U having a

68
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,680
accurate time control or Precision timee

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,400
keeping was crucial for a lot of

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,319
different applications um uh for example

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,879
determining the longitude in Maritime um

72
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:27,720
navigation or Precision Metallurgy or uh

73
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,720
terestrial investigations um they all

74
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,480
required an accurate measure of

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,159
time and um well John Harrison over 50

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,959
years he developed these engineering

77
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,080
masterpieces that are entirely

78
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,519
mechanical to enable um having a very

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,680
accurate measure of time um to the point

80
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,680
that his latest version called H5 only

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,439
had one second of error after three days

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,640
of operation something that was

83
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,360
unimaginable at the time um so if you

84
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,280
look into the way

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,480
that look into a closer look into the

86
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,200
very first version of these clocks you

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,560
do see a whole lot of mechanical

88
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,159
components including a bunch of harmonic

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,959
oscillators um including the spring the

90
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,919
pendulums are all coupled together and

91
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,199
then connected through gears pulley and

92
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,519
levers um to the clock handles to create

93
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,560
the clock rotation that result in what

94
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,680
we see using these

95
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,680
handles so um obviously a whole lot of

96
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,479
engineering mechanical engineering has

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,280
been gone into such a system system to

98
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,320
enable such a performance and eventually

99
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,440
a handheld

100
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,800
device fast forward um with the

101
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,240
electronics era things start to change

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,520
um the invention of electronics and

103
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,199
invention of the integrated electronics

104
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,759
and its proliferation for different

105
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,360
applications obviously opened up the

106
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,080
door to a whole lot of new applications

107
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,800
um and obviously electronic systems

108
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,960
replaced a whole lot of mechanical

109
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,720
counterparts um however still some of

110
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,560
mechanical components specific

111
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,440
mechanical components was very

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,759
Irreplaceable and they actually made

113
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,840
their way there evolved their V into

114
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,880
electronic

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
Microsystems the specific type of these

116
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,520
devices has been mechanical resonators

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,560
uh that even now they are crucial

118
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:24,240
components for time and frequency

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,880
control um on the left you do see um a a

120
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,000
a probably very familiar um picture um I

121
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,400
I doubt if anyone here uh cannot

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,199
recognize this metallic package that you

123
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,800
typically see in any sort of electronic

124
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,759
board that hosts a quarz crystal as a

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,319
piso electric resonator is a mechanical

126
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,479
resonator that upon application of

127
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,919
electric field a mechanical vibration is

128
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,199
being generated and that's being used to

129
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,280
generate um clocks and it's obvious that

130
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,680
clocks are crucial for computing for

131
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,160
Signal processing and for

132
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,759
communication um on right U you see uh

133
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,600
just make making sure right and left is

134
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,599
correct yes on your right you do see um

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,560
another type of very crucial component

136
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:12,160
uh bulk acoustic fave resonators um that

137
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,720
are the backbone basically making the

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,080
backbone of our Wireless Systems and

139
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,360
what are these These are basically pis

140
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,360
electric tint films that are excited

141
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,319
through application of electric field in

142
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,360
an RF resonance mode and then once a

143
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,919
bunch of them are connected together as

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,039
it is shown here they are actually

145
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,880
making a bandpass filter um that is key

146
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,000
for spectral processing in a a a

147
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,160
congested V of wireless communication

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,360
the takeaway here is mechanical

149
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,639
resonators are essential and obviously

150
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,319
they play a major role in creating these

151
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,400
kind of frequency control and time

152
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,039
control applications and at the same

153
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,759
time if you look into these devices

154
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,360
they're typically the only uh devices

155
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:03,080
that are cannot yet be monolithically

156
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,319
integrated on Baseline semiconductor

157
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,800
chips but what's significant about

158
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,199
mechanical resonators that make them IR

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,120
replaceable um is basically a very

160
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,800
important property of them which is

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,440
quality Factor quality factor is the

162
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,919
most important figure of Merit of of any

163
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,080
resonator regardless of it is an

164
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,560
electrical resonator or a mechanical

165
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,639
resonator and it basically is a measure

166
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,000
of how good it is as a frequency

167
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,080
selector resonator as a frequency

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,759
selective component typically has a

169
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,599
transfer function that is a peak and the

170
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,680
sharper the peak is it means the higher

171
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,039
the quality or the higher the quality

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,240
factor of the resonator is clearly you

173
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,479
want to have the sharpest Peak possible

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,400
to have the best resonator and if you

175
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,560
compare a mechanical resonator

176
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,120
Q with an electrical resonator a simple

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,280
LC tank you typically see that the que

178
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,680
of a mechanical resonator is few orders

179
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,800
of magnitude higher compared to

180
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,879
electrical um oscillator on LC tank for

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,720
example you expect achieving Q's in the

182
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,240
order of million in a mechanical

183
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,720
resonator while the Q of LC tanks are

184
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,120
typically limited to 10 or 20 and the

185
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,440
reason is if you look into the the the

186
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,720
physics that defines this quality Factor

187
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,759
the sharpness of the peak it corresponds

188
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,639
to the inverse relation between the

189
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
energy is stored in the system and

190
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,919
energy dissipated in the system and

191
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,319
fundamentally electrical systems are

192
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,800
more prone to dissip

193
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,560
therefore the quality factor of

194
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,159
mechanical resonators are much

195
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,080
higher but how does the higher quality

196
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,880
Factor translates into frequency control

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
applications if you talk about a clock

198
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,040
generation or generation of an

199
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,120
oscillator the quality Factor shows

200
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,240
itself in in the

201
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,800
noise that actually is shown

202
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,279
qualitatively here the lower quality

203
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
Factor typically induces capturing more

204
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,959
noise and then once you make an

205
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,079
oscillator your oscillation would not be

206
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,200
a perfect sinos soid dool as you

207
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:07,320
wish when it comes to filter

208
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,200
applications or spectral processor a

209
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,320
higher quality Factor corresponds to a

210
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,399
sharper Side Band skirt of your your

211
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,920
filter enables a better selectivity

212
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,440
between inband and out of band obviously

213
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,560
the resonator that has a high quality

214
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,640
factor is basically is a more selective

215
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,800
filter and at the same time has a lower

216
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,320
loss so clearly mechanical resonators

217
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,839
are probably

218
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,600
much better in terms of providing

219
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,440
quality factors so that it is not

220
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,880
possible to replace them with electrical

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,440
counterparts that's why if you open a

222
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,680
specific or a u uh kind of a common um

223
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,839
smartphone such as the iPhone 13 for

224
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,480
example and you start to investigate

225
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,320
different components that are used in

226
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,480
the board you'll notice a bunch of chaps

227
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,040
here they're marked in red that they

228
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,680
contain few at least one or few

229
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
mechanical resonator within and it's

230
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,839
it's very interesting because if you

231
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,640
compare apparently the number of the

232
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,120
chips that contain mechanical resonator

233
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,079
is numerous while the only there's only

234
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,959
one cheap that hosts the processor for

235
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,120
you so your processor is basically a

236
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,320
single chip but those that are doing the

237
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,120
mechanical resonance resonator is within

238
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
them there are there are many the reason

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,160
is clear uh when it comes to wireless

240
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
communication you probably want to have

241
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,519
a whole lot of filters because you do

242
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,720
have different applications you have LTE

243
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
you have Wi-Fi you have Bluetooth each

244
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,480
of them happening at different frequency

245
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
you probably need a separate filter for

246
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,000
each of them there you go with different

247
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,920
chips and when it comes to clock

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,200
generation some of the clocks you just

249
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,160
wanted to use them for generating clocks

250
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,120
for computing some of them are more

251
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,200
accurate clock for navigation or for

252
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,160
other applications or higher frequency

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,639
applications therefore at the end of the

254
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,760
day we'll end up with a whole lot of

255
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,079
resonators fast forward 10 years what's

256
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
going to happen we're going to have

257
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,639
computers that need probably instead of

258
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,040
one clock 10 clocks because they want to

259
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,320
operate in parallel with different cores

260
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,800
so they probably need much more clocks

261
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,480
we're going to talk about wireless

262
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,720
communication that extends all the V2

263
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,480
mimet vaves we're going to have billions

264
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,320
of users by Internet of Things added to

265
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,040
the wireless communication ecosystem

266
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,040
which means that we probably instead of

267
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,560
having these many filters we will need

268
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,000
much more than that to give you an

269
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,519
estimate all of the cell phones that we

270
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,920
have having typically in the range of

271
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,440
200 mechanical resonators

272
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,000
within thinking about the addition of

273
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,680
these all these new users and the

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,800
extension of the wireless to millimeter

275
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,560
V Spectrum it's easy to imagine we will

276
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,279
probably need 200,000 resonators and

277
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,120
then imagine if you wanted to have each

278
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,120
of them in one of these chips and then

279
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,240
integrate them obviously on a scalable

280
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,880
so what is ideal then is is it possible

281
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,480
to go through the same approach that

282
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,399
processor event is it possible to

283
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,920
integrate all of these mechanical

284
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,240
resonators through a single Universal

285
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,760
platform and even better is it possible

286
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,279
to integrate them somehow at the front

287
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,160
end or the back end of our seos or

288
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,959
semiconductor chip that way we obviously

289
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,880
provide a path for extreme scalability

290
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,639
without having the concern to have too

291
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,839
many chips and

292
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,680
different uh to to take different part

293
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,839
of our board

294
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,839
so we are not the first to think of the

295
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:40,279
significance of such solution um back in

296
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,600
1960s the idea started to integrate

297
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,839
mechanical resonators with

298
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,120
transistors um Nathanson 1967

299
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,360
demonstrated a the resonant body

300
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,480
transist resonant gate transistor

301
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,360
concept there it was basically a beam

302
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,880
that was sitting at top um of a channel

303
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,000
between a drain and source and once the

304
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,920
beam was oscillating at a frequency in

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,360
the range of a few tens of kilohertz

306
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,000
then the the current that could passed

307
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,040
through the channel between the and

308
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,560
Source could be modulated and it

309
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,639
actually could be filtered corresponding

310
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,720
to the frequency of the gate that way he

311
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,880
managed to put the resonator besides the

312
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,000
electronics on a single chip and then

313
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,680
obviously with doing that he managed to

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,320
make oscillators or even coupled

315
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,480
resonators together to make filters

316
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,600
clearly after 1967 and with the the

317
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,000
emergence of the era of solid estate

318
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,000
electronics and monolithic Electronics

319
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
uh clearly this non-solid estate kind of

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,079
architecture was not feasible so it was

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
not continued however more recently

322
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,560
there are other research groups who

323
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,839
started to looking back into integration

324
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,040
of micro and non mechanical resonator

325
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,000
either on the front end of the

326
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,560
camos or on the back end of the line um

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,240
of the the the cheap uh here are two

328
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,839
examples the first example is uh a

329
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,639
megahertz seos back end of the line

330
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,199
integrated uh metal insulator metal beam

331
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:15,160
resonator that is then connected

332
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:17,639
directly to amplifier to make an

333
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:22,399
oscillator and uh it's basically the

334
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:26,279
work done by my colleague at Taiwan

335
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,360
chinua University um shangan Le group

336
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,680
and another work that is done by my my

337
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,279
colleague and friend Don Weinstein where

338
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,320
they integrated the resonator actually

339
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,639
benefited from the standard camos

340
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,360
devices on the front end basically the

341
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,440
finfets to excite mechanical resonance

342
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,240
through the use of dialectric gates and

343
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,399
they managed to basically achieve high

344
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
frequency resonators all the way up to

345
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,560
11

346
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,560
gahz on seos

347
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,920
sorry let

348
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,360
just my my apologies just

349
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,040
jumped okay sorry for the int

350
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,560
Interruption so uh what was the problem

351
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,360
with um these Solutions so the problem

352
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,560
with these Solutions however is all of

353
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,160
these devices similar to the resonant

354
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,920
gate transistor they benefited from a

355
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,040
specific electromechanical transduction

356
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,360
that was not really uh efficient um so

357
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,360
the way that they operated they

358
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,279
benefited from electrostatic

359
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,480
transduction where you apply your

360
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,199
electric field across a capacitor that

361
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,600
is either filled with a dialectric or it

362
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,040
is filled with with air gap or vacuum

363
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,279
and then upon application of electric

364
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,000
field you would convert uh the voltage

365
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,800
into some sort of force through kums law

366
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,959
the problem of that transction is it is

367
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,759
not really efficient which means that

368
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,959
the energy exchange between electrical

369
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,759
signal and the mechanical motion was not

370
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,880
really efficient the way to define that

371
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,360
or to quantify that is true a u the

372
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,440
basically a parameter that I'm going to

373
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,639
use it a lot of times during this talk

374
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,920
so it's um it's called KS square or the

375
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,880
coupling between electrical domain and

376
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,360
mechanical domain it actually is the

377
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,199
ratio between the energy that is

378
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,040
transferred to your mechanics um based

379
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,040
on the energy that is inserted in

380
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,160
electronical in electronics domain the

381
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,560
problem of electromechanical translution

382
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,600
that has been used in all of these

383
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,560
applications was it was very inefficient

384
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,079
so if you compare the K square of camos

385
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,519
Ms capacitive CS Ms it has been in the

386
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,079
order of 10 to the minus 4 which is very

387
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,240
a small number and if you compare it

388
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,199
with aluminum nitrate a 10 film p

389
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,440
Electric that is used to create filters

390
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,480
you're talking about a number of 1% to

391
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,519
10% so you can see nearly two orders of

392
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,199
magnitude less efficient um these

393
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,640
resonators are when you wanted to

394
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,120
convert the energy from electrical

395
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,640
domain to Mechanical

396
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,240
domain another major problem of all of

397
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,720
these typically devices is um when we

398
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,880
want to talk about making a clock um the

399
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,000
the materials that are being used here

400
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,039
to create resonator is either metal or

401
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,959
um silicon or silicon dioxide um they

402
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,039
are typically very temperature sensitive

403
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,200
it it in terms of of the elasticity

404
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,559
which means that if the temperature

405
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,720
changes their stiffness changes a lot

406
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,760
and that immediately translates into the

407
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,840
shift of the frequency that's something

408
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,200
that you don't want to happen because

409
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,400
when you wanted to make an oscillator

410
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,880
you want to make sure the frequency is a

411
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,760
constant um that is not affected by the

412
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
temperature variations so if you want to

413
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,720
give you some number if you

414
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,200
compare the uh capactive mems with with

415
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,159
quartz you're talking about the

416
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,679
temperature sensitivity for uh reson

417
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,960
implemented in front end of the line or

418
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,400
back end of the line um is in the order

419
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,480
of 30 to 100 part per million shift in

420
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,159
the frequency per degree C which is

421
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,080
orders of magnitude again larger

422
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,000
compared to another p Electric resonator

423
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,600
that we had quartz which is typically

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,799
less than one part per million per

425
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,720
degree C so so we do see that although

426
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,640
the goal has been very attractive and it

427
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,400
has been efforts to enable this

428
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,600
integration there are major challenges

429
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,760
um for the integration

430
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,679
however starting

431
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,360
2011 a new discovery happened that

432
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,720
opened up a whole new opportunity for

433
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:45,320
integration of mechanical resonators

434
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,600
with seos and the discovery was the high

435
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,960
dialectric material that has been long

436
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,919
being used um to serve as a high

437
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,960
dialectric in advanced semos devices

438
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,360
which is the

439
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,559
haia haum dioxide or haia it basically

440
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,840
turns that if you apply certain

441
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,080
thermomechanical treatment on it you can

442
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,919
convert it into a specific

443
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,360
crystallinity that is polarized and

444
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,000
therefore it can serve as a piso

445
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,960
electric um so so the effect is

446
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,880
basically investigated uh by observing

447
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,159
the fedo electricity which means that

448
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,720
you do have a polarized film and upon

449
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,720
application of a voltage we can change

450
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,480
the direction of this polarization but

451
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,520
at the same time since it is a polarized

452
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,280
material then it turns out that you can

453
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,280
also um benefit from the p Electric

454
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,720
coupling in this material at the time it

455
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,679
was a very small P electricity that was

456
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,480
observed what does it mean it means we

457
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,799
already discovered rediscovered a

458
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,240
material that has been already within

459
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,799
the seos and now we can somehow convert

460
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,080
it into a pzo transducer that probably

461
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:55,039
is much more efficient for translution

462
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,039
of electromechanical

463
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,080
resonators back in 2019 the started to

464
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,600
see can we make a high frequency

465
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,159
resonator out of this 10 nanometer or

466
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,640
sub 10 nanometer new ferroelectric hnea

467
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,880
film and yes we were successful we

468
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,159
demonstrated the very first nanoscale

469
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,039
resonator and the resonator was quite

470
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,520
kind of sophisticated in terms of the

471
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,120
stack and I just purposefully add this

472
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,000
to show there a bunch of different

473
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,200
layers in it including a layer of

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,840
aluminum nitrite um so we we developed

475
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,240
the resonator that we could actuate it

476
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,120
with aluminum nitrate and this time we

477
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:36,000
used the haia or a sibling of it haia

478
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,159
zerconia that was polarized through the

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,720
specific processing that we developed

480
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,760
and we tried to use it as a

481
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,919
electromechanical sensor and we have

482
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,600
been successful so we managed to excite

483
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:53,240
mechanical mode at 12.8 gahz and then we

484
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,880
benefited from this very thin half zunia

485
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,679
in the order of 10 nanometers to translu

486
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,520
and to sense the charge es through p

487
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,760
Electric effect okay successful however

488
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,640
although this was the very first

489
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,440
demonstration of a gahz resonator using

490
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,000
haia or haia zerconia as a transducer

491
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,840
the major problem is if you look into

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,279
the insertion loss indicates the couling

493
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,240
is very weak so you have an insertion

494
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,440
loss of nearly 9- 70 DB indicating your

495
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,520
electromechanical coupling is a still

496
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,720
very very poor well this actually

497
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,880
contradicts the purpose the purpose was

498
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,080
having a pzo that provides a good

499
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,320
coupling apparently the coupling was not

500
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,600
really good so to understand how we can

501
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,360
solve the problem of the coupling I have

502
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,799
to first briefly talk about the specific

503
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:49,200
process that we use to crystallize the

504
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:51,080
films so uh haia or haia zerconia has a

505
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,440
specific crystalline characteristic that

506
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,400
it is a multimorph so it can happen when

507
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,200
it is

508
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,840
ordered to have different

509
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,960
crystallinities so it can take a

510
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,799
tetragonal crystalline form it can take

511
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,480
a monoclinic or it can take

512
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,120
oromic out of all of these crystalline

513
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,000
form that it can take at room

514
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,320
temperature there's only one of them

515
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,320
that is polarized and is ferric and pis

516
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,720
electric which is the

517
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,600
utomic and once we do the AL to have a

518
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,760
10 nomer let's say half zerconia in

519
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,960
order to crystallize it because it's

520
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,080
initially a morphus you you need to

521
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,640
apply this specific boundary condition

522
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,200
that is basically achieved through

523
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,200
adding metal electrodes with a different

524
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,799
coefficient of thermal expansion and

525
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,679
once you put a material with different

526
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,679
coefficient of thermal expansion and you

527
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,480
apply it an RTA rapid thermal analing

528
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,080
the tensile stress that is being

529
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,200
generated starts to crystallize it and

530
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,919
then if you do that carefully you manage

531
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,720
to crystallize the majority of the

532
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,440
domain into your desirable ferroelectric

533
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,440
oromic or the polar

534
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,960
base so therefore the key in formation

535
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,760
of a polar film is the stress you have

536
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,600
to apply the tensile stress well guess

537
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,279
what when you make a resonator you

538
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,520
typically want to levitate it and as

539
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:21,000
soon as you levitate it which means that

540
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,080
you have a substrate that you release so

541
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,919
you have a freestanding membrane well

542
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,080
you immediately just get rid of all the

543
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,000
stress so you relax the tensile stress

544
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,000
and clearly what would happen is as soon

545
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,080
as you relax the stress you suddenly see

546
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,480
surprisingly the polarization

547
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,120
significantly

548
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,760
reduces indicating some transformation

549
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,600
is again happening upon release looking

550
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,080
into dialectric constant it turns out

551
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,360
that the dialectric constant is also

552
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,760
increasing giving us signs that

553
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,360
apparently our favorable orthorombic

554
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,360
polarized um crystallinity is now being

555
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,480
converted back into something else

556
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,559
apparently monoclinic phase which is

557
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,000
undesirable and that is basically the

558
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,039
reason why the ks Square becomes again

559
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,480
very small because you release your

560
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:12,039
resonator and you just relax The

561
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,679
Strain so we started to further look

562
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:19,559
into it and we may test the structures

563
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,320
and in order to identify the uh the

564
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,440
relative distribution of different

565
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,760
morphologies either oromic or non-polar

566
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,080
phases we did an xrd on the sample

567
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,320
across different releasing steps so we

568
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,440
started with a solidly mounted film then

569
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,080
we half relased it then we fully

570
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,480
released it and over the all of these

571
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,600
steps we did an xrd to identify the

572
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,520
contribution of different morphologies

573
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,840
in our film and as we expected once we

574
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,640
looked into the xrd turns out that

575
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,159
initially the defraction Peaks

576
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,039
corresponding to the oromic preferred

577
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,279
was the largest but as we released it

578
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,159
other Peaks

579
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,039
started to promote that corresponds to

580
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,960
the monoclinic phase so which means that

581
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,520
you already have a resonate a a membrane

582
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,399
that is tensile stress and then it shows

583
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,679
a good polarization but as soon as you

584
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:17,480
release it again the domains starts to

585
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,559
go back into your nonpolar and therefore

586
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:24,640
you will not have a good p Electric

587
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:29,159
transducer so here came one Innovation

588
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,919
we said okay if we care about the stress

589
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,520
well the only way that we can have

590
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,000
access to a stress is either through the

591
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,679
top surface bottom surface or in the

592
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,840
middle so why not instead of growing the

593
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:43,720
film entirely interrupt the growth and

594
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:47,159
add another material in between that

595
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,919
enables to sustain the stress here is

596
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,440
what we did that instead of having a 20

597
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:54,159
nomer half NE zerconia we started with

598
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,399
10 nomer we inserted Institue we

599
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,799
inserted an in layer of 1 nomer alumina

600
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:02,799
and then we added another 10 nanom halfa

601
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,440
so that the thicknesses are the same and

602
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,320
we did the same process of

603
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,840
release favorably we did see that the

604
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,399
utomic peak stayed where it was and we

605
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,360
did not see any promotion of the peak

606
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:18,120
corresponding to the monoc clinic

607
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,760
therefore we call this approach

608
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,159
formation of a super lattice because if

609
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,960
you wanted to keep doing this scaling it

610
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,880
all you need is after every few nomer

611
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,760
you insert few nomer few layers of

612
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,240
alumina again half again alumina and

613
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,760
then these inter layers considering

614
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,559
alumina is a very hard material ensure

615
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,960
it sustains the tensile stress so that

616
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,640
even if your film gets released you will

617
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,200
not see the reduction in the

618
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,279
polarization so this is what we call

619
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,600
alumina haia zerconia superlattice this

620
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,360
is what we use to make

621
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,679
resonators

622
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,600
so next we we started to make resonators

623
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,760
and the first thing that we tried to do

624
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,799
we tried to extract the p Electric

625
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,000
coefficients um because if you want to

626
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,279
know what is the K Square you need to

627
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,960
know what are the p Electric

628
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,840
coefficients the relation between the

629
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,000
strain and the applied electric

630
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,919
field and we actually measured the

631
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,760
polarization loop after application of

632
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,679
different cycling which is cycling a p

633
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,200
Electric or fer electric material is a

634
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,799
well-known approach to basically vake it

635
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,279
up to operate in a in a proper p

636
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,720
Electric regime and we actually did that

637
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:40,799
and it turns out that initially we had a

638
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,640
very large displacement in 1K after

639
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,039
1,000 uh switching cycles and it was

640
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,480
however it was very nonlinear and

641
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,919
unstable but as we kept doing this

642
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:56,559
cycling and cycling it trained or it

643
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,399
basically made sure or V waked up the

644
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,799
film to the point that it became became

645
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,880
like a linear transducer and here is the

646
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,840
outcome so initially we had very large

647
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,039
displacement but very

648
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,720
nonlinear but after

649
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,519
cycling we managed to get this butterfly

650
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,240
Loop displacement Loop which is what we

651
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,559
expected to get for a linear p Electric

652
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,159
here you do see this butterfly Loop

653
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,600
which actually goes across the Hy's Loop

654
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,159
of a Ferro electric and then the slope

655
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,360
because the y- axis is the displacement

656
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:32,519
the x-axis is the volt voltage the slope

657
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,159
shows the p Electric coefficients and

658
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,039
once we extracted it we measured nearly

659
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,519
nine picometer per volt which is nearly

660
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,880
twice that of aluminum nitrite the tin

661
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,960
fil material that is used to make

662
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,440
filters so it turns out with creating

663
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,799
the super lattice with sustaining the

664
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,720
stress we managed to achieve actually a

665
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:54,279
very large electromechanical coupling so

666
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,039
once we have that electromechanical

667
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:59,440
coupling the next step is creating Nome

668
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,760
mechanical resonator

669
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,440
so we we basically implemented

670
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,960
resonators we put interdigitated

671
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,240
transducers and then applied electric

672
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,159
field and then depending on the distance

673
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,480
the peach size of these interdigitated

674
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,240
transducers we can excite acoustic waves

675
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,760
across this

676
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,519
Channel with different wavelengths and

677
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,320
obviously that results in resonators

678
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,720
with different frequencies because these

679
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,960
acoustic waves propagate back and forth

680
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,919
reflect back at these stressfree

681
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,600
boundary and it results in a resonator

682
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,360
with different frequencies so we made

683
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,360
resonators with different IDP sizes

684
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,880
which is the Lambda changing the Lambda

685
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,120
from six to two the the frequency is

686
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,200
inversely proportional to the

687
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,880
wavelengths so the the the smaller the

688
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,480
Lambda became we managed to get Peaks at

689
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,640
higher and higher frequencies therefore

690
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,559
we successfully demonstrated gigahertz

691
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,480
resonators with much better insertion

692
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,640
loss if you compare the insertion losses

693
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,000
instead of- 70 is now minus 20 this is

694
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,480
still far from the ideal but we managed

695
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,240
to improve it by nearly 50 DB because of

696
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,919
this super lce

697
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,519
formation so we also achieved a very

698
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,919
high quality factors the fq product

699
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,880
which is a important an important figure

700
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,919
of Merit for the resonators uh is

701
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,760
basically is

702
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,559
nearly 5 10 to the 11 which is well not

703
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,760
as good as a single Crystal silicon

704
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,360
carbide or silicon but for a material

705
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,840
that is developed by Al is a very high

706
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,840
quality

707
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:44,440
Factor we also investigated a very

708
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,080
interesting feature of these transducers

709
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,440
and the fact that they are fero electric

710
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,559
it means that depending on if you apply

711
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,960
a bias depending on where you bias your

712
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,519
film you can operate in the regions

713
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,360
where the polarization is z Z which

714
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,320
means that your film becomes a nonp

715
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,120
electric through DC tuning that means if

716
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,240
you apply different DC

717
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,919
voltages you can Gull your

718
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,080
electromechanical translution and

719
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,000
effectively turning your resonator

720
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,399
off here is actually uh this is

721
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,559
demonstrated by applying different

722
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,639
voltages we manag to switch the

723
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,799
resonator off which means that we can

724
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:23,919
have a

725
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,120
resonator and we can have at the same

726
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,760
time an intrinsic switch without the

727
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,480
need for any external switch and this is

728
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,200
where very uh interesting because once

729
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,679
we wanted to array a bunch of these

730
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,279
resonators in future applications we

731
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,200
probably want to be able to bring them

732
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:41,639
in and out have them on and off um

733
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,080
without having uh basically a whole lot

734
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:47,760
of switches to cover that right and then

735
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,760
that intrinsic switching is doing this

736
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:55,639
purpose so the question is if you want

737
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,039
to have a free standing membrane is it

738
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:01,799
feasible on seos but well think about it

739
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,919
seos probably once you do the back end

740
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:07,159
of the line you're terminating it with

741
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,240
some um insulators and some metals and

742
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,120
if you wanted to release or make a free

743
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,279
standing film it could be challenging

744
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,440
because you have to Edge some

745
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,600
sacrificial material underneath your

746
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,559
resonator to make it

747
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,880
levitate however an alternative approach

748
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,919
is instead of etching underneath the

749
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,399
resonator which could be challenging for

750
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,399
seos integration we started to use

751
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:32,600
another type of uh boundary that is

752
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,240
called brag mirror BR mirror is

753
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,360
basically is an acoustic band Gap

754
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,679
structure that you can identify the

755
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,320
thicknesses of the materials with highly

756
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,639
different acoustic impedance such as

757
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:48,320
tonan and silicon dioxide and then once

758
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:50,320
you stack it over the entire stack acts

759
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,159
like an acoustic mirror which means that

760
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,679
you mimic the stressfree or the uh

761
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,000
membrane that is underneath this air gap

762
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:02,440
you mimic that with this brag

763
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,120
meter at the same time we pushed to

764
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,639
miniaturize the resonator size so that

765
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,080
we can integrated back end of the line

766
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:13,200
of 150 nomer seos and then we manag to

767
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,960
make resonators that are nearly 4 Micron

768
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,840
by 4 Micron and they operate in

769
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,440
thickness extensional mode here you can

770
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,799
see the energy diagram showing the

771
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,799
energy is kind of concentrated at the p

772
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,120
Electric layer and then we managed to

773
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:29,360
suddenly increase the frequency by

774
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,120
scaling the size all the way to 17

775
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,760
gahz and we also managed to switch them

776
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,039
on and

777
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:41,200
off however having all of these set we

778
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,240
still have problems so we dealing with a

779
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,639
PL or structure well go back into the

780
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,919
discussion that we have if you want to

781
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:51,120
have 15,000 of these devices well it's

782
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,840
still taking a whole lot of area right

783
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,320
these are not a small devices each of

784
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,080
them is 100 micrometer by 100 micrometer

785
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,960
so well is it really realistic to make

786
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,880
one of these large devices at top of a

787
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,440
tiny seos chip that is probably very

788
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,840
expensive probably not another problem

789
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,679
is yes we are improving the insertion

790
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,760
loss but is still far from what we want

791
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,919
if you want to have a filter you have to

792
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,879
make sure your insertion loss is is near

793
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:20,919
zero you do not induce any loss so yes

794
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:23,440
we improved it from -70 to minus 20 but

795
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,079
we still need to improve an outer 20

796
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,040
well the reason that the insertion loss

797
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,359
of these devices is still large is

798
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,359
because the p Electric property that

799
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,919
they're using is the transverse you're

800
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,879
applying the electric field across the

801
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:39,679
film and the motion is transverse

802
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,440
Direction there is another modality in p

803
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,560
Electric films that is longitudinal

804
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,079
which means that if you apply the

805
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,520
electric field and the motion is in the

806
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,119
same direction your K Square becomes

807
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,040
much larger so maybe a better idea is to

808
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,599
go after those and at the same time one

809
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,520
major challenge that we have is okay yes

810
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,480
you can change the distance between the

811
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,920
electrodes the Peach size of the

812
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,960
electrodes to increase the frequency but

813
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,160
how far can you do that because at the

814
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,320
end of the day you have very long filter

815
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,119
fingers of the electrodes and then they

816
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,800
become narrower and narrower once you

817
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,000
wanted to make them closer together to

818
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,599
make to go to higher frequency well the

819
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,560
major problem is if they become too

820
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,000
narrow they become too resistively lossy

821
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,720
so which means that they are going to

822
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,079
degrade your quality

823
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,200
Factor so because of that we started to

824
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,079
entirely look into the new architecture

825
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,880
of res Ator and the architecture is

826
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,599
called a ferroelectric gate th acoustic

827
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,839
resonator this is a three-dimensional

828
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:42,480
acoustic resonator architecture there

829
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,000
you have silicon nanoes and then you put

830
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,280
this feto electric halfa gate all around

831
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,880
it and then you pattern your

832
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,400
three-dimensional

833
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,480
electrons immediately as soon as we go

834
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,000
from planer devices into

835
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,079
three-dimensional

836
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,599
devices the significant of

837
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,440
three-dimensional devices is they're

838
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,280
taking much a smaller footprint for the

839
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,440
same reason that finfets are being

840
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,119
developed to replace plane or

841
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,160
transistors if we benefit from fin

842
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,359
resonators we can integrate a large

843
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,800
number of resonators at different

844
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:20,960
frequencies all on a single chip that

845
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,960
again serves the purpose of massive

846
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,359
scaling another major advantage of these

847
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,920
fin type resonators is the fact that if

848
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,800
you look into the the the mode they are

849
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,000
operating in a Vitz extensional mode

850
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,400
that are actually the animation is shown

851
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,240
here and they are actually operating in

852
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,319
the bulk acoustic mode that is defined

853
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,599
by the width of the resonator the

854
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,839
takeaway message you can change the

855
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,040
width of the fin very simply using

856
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,480
lithography and then once you change the

857
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,400
width you can change the frequency so

858
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,400
which means that as it is modeled here

859
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,040
as you change the width of the Silicon

860
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,160
fin you can change the frequency all the

861
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,760
way from 0o to 30

862
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:12,000
gahz all it takes is to Define fins with

863
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,000
different wides using optical or EB

864
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,319
lithography we fabricated these

865
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,720
devices at our clean room and then a

866
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,680
major step here is to define the

867
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,240
three-dimensional electrodes so we have

868
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,040
an input Port of the resonator and

869
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,720
output Port of the resonator the

870
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,599
resonator is aligned in a specific

871
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,560
Crystal orientation for better

872
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,240
fabrication and better performance and

873
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,160
then if you wanted to increase the

874
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,000
effective transction area which is the

875
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,720
area of the electrode on the sidewall

876
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,599
you can benefit from several things in

877
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,599
parallel and then having them in

878
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,119
series here is the cross-sectional tem

879
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,800
um of the

880
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,119
resonator and as you can

881
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,760
see we manag to make resonators that are

882
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,319
very large in aspect ratio for this

883
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,880
specific case for example we dealing

884
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:08,920
with a width of like nearly 100 100 to

885
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,319
150 while the height of the resor is in

886
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,599
excess of six Micron which means that we

887
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,240
manag to make a structures that has a

888
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,960
very high aspect

889
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,839
ratio and then by doing so we manag to

890
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,720
go the frequency all the way higher so

891
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,079
if you look into this structure there is

892
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,760
a central silicon Fin and then it is

893
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,359
wrapped around by the fedro electric

894
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,280
gate if you further zoom in you see that

895
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,440
the federal electric gate is again the

896
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,079
non laminated right is a super lattice

897
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,280
of alumina and haia

898
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,560
zerconia and then it actually is wrapped

899
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,119
around the electrodes are patterned

900
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,400
inside in a three-dimensional Manner and

901
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,440
obviously a major part of this project

902
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,880
was to develop a sophisticated

903
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,520
fabrication process to enable these type

904
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,440
of

905
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,880
devices the

906
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,800
measurements so we scale the width of

907
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,400
the fin and then we manag to to scale

908
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,920
the frequency so we made resonators all

909
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,880
the way from 8 GHz to 13 GHz all in the

910
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,599
same batch on a very small area and

911
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,560
again we managed to switch them on and

912
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,720
off by applying a DC bios thanks to the

913
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,720
fer electricity of haia

914
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,640
zerconia one other thing that can be

915
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,520
achieved is if you connect a bunch of

916
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,880
these resonators together you can make

917
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,480
band pass filters one architecture is

918
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,240
shown here is called the ladder filter

919
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,319
where you connect these resonators with

920
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,720
a slightly different frequencies to make

921
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:37,720
a band pass filter with a desirable

922
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,800
passband width here's the three the the

923
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,640
side view of it you can see how the

924
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,640
electrical connection is is

925
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:50,839
achieved and if you compare the

926
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,680
footprint of these resonators with a

927
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:56,319
pler resonator it can illuminate the

928
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,520
significance of three-dimensional

929
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:01,200
fabrication compared to the planar so

930
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,800
here you can see a typical filter in the

931
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,640
same area of a typical planar filter

932
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,240
commercial filter you can Feit at least

933
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,800
56 filters and you have not even pushed

934
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,599
the limits of integration which means

935
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,839
that once you benefit from the third

936
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,280
dimension you can

937
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,920
extremely scale down the integration and

938
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,400
that's exactly what we wanted we wanted

939
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,760
to have a technology that could cover a

940
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,520
wide range of frequencies and wouldn't

941
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,400
take so much space we just just

942
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,200
integrate all of these resonators on a

943
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,280
single chip to take a very small

944
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,480
footprint here's the performance of

945
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,160
filters at different frequencies all

946
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,920
integrated on the same

947
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:46,640
die we manage to cover the entire band

948
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,839
expand from 8 gahz to 12 gahz and as you

949
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,560
can see by benefiting from the the the

950
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,839
the higher p Electric coupling tanks to

951
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,560
the longitudinal p Electric effect we

952
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:59,640
managed to improve the insertion lost

953
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,200
significantly although there is still a

954
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,400
a large room to improve so you can see

955
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,520
that we made filters that could be

956
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,920
selected on and off by the fer

957
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:13,040
electricity and then we can cover a very

958
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,040
wide spectrum by an array of

959
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,680
filters so now that we kind of addressed

960
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,240
how resonators for filters can be

961
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,720
implemented and could have favorable

962
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,839
properties compared to the plan or

963
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,079
counterparts let's look into the clock

964
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:32,359
application to so we said haia can it

965
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,200
replace quartz to answer that question

966
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:37,280
we have to compare the most important

967
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,720
characteristic of quars fit which is the

968
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,520
temperature stability so what we did is

969
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,880
we started to temperature characterize

970
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,000
our halfa zerconia resonator here's the

971
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,160
comparison of a measured half zerconia

972
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,200
resonator across the temperature change

973
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:57,680
fromus 40 to 120 and then the Y AIS it

974
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,440
shows the frequency drift

975
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,680
at cut quarts as expected has a very

976
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,640
small frequency drift so you see that as

977
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,119
we go from minus 40 to 120 you only have

978
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,480
nearly 60 part per million of frequency

979
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:12,280
drift on the other hand our resonator

980
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,839
showed extremely large temperature

981
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,319
sensitivity which is very unfavorable so

982
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,880
as you can see the line is so sharp and

983
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,280
steep that you cannot even see how far

984
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,839
it will go the slope is extremely large

985
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:31,040
so the bad news half zonia very

986
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,880
temperature sensitive so well does that

987
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,520
reduce the chance of it to become or

988
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,160
replace the quarts to generate a clock

989
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,440
well there may be some light at the end

990
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,839
of the

991
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,119
tunnel if you look into

992
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,040
haia there's a very interesting feature

993
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,359
about halfa as you change the

994
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,280
temperature which is demonstrated by a

995
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,800
group in North

996
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,559
Carolina and you keep doing the xrd you

997
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,839
can monitor the evolution of

998
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,480
crystallinity

999
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,079
and it turns out yes maybe at room

1000
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,839
temperature you're at utomic but if you

1001
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,920
go high enough and by High I mean 700 or

1002
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:13,640
800 deg C you will start to change the

1003
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:16,599
morphology again from utomic into

1004
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,440
tetragonal so why does it matter it

1005
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:21,440
matters

1006
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,839
because if you look into the ab initial

1007
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,839
calculations for a hypothetical

1008
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,440
tetragonal half zerconia it turns out

1009
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:34,440
that it is a stiffer compared to monoc

1010
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,599
Clinic phase that is p Electric that

1011
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,240
means at some

1012
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:44,119
point

1013
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:47,160
this oromic will be converted into

1014
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:52,200
tetragonal that multimorph

1015
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:54,079
characteristics results in a up bending

1016
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,640
of the elasticity temperature

1017
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,880
characteristic which means that although

1018
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,920
halfa has a very negative frequency

1019
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,839
dependence but if you look into the

1020
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,160
second order of it because of the fact

1021
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,960
that at some point it will like to

1022
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,520
become tetragonal it

1023
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,240
results in a some sort of turnover

1024
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,920
Behavior which means that yes the first

1025
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,119
order is negative but the second order

1026
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,200
of its elasticity is positive which

1027
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:24,800
means that yes over over the temperature

1028
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,319
increases but at some point it will it

1029
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,040
decreases but at some point it will

1030
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,040
increase

1031
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,559
surprisingly this is exactly opposite to

1032
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,520
another material that is available on

1033
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,800
SEMA silicon the oxide is exactly

1034
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:42,240
opposite has a very positive linear

1035
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,640
temperature dependency but its second

1036
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,119
order temperature dependency is

1037
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,160
negative well so is there a chance that

1038
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,559
we make a mixture of the two and

1039
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,640
compensate both first order and second

1040
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:55,480
order temperature dependency and here is

1041
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,040
what we

1042
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,800
did the investig tigated uh different

1043
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,200
structures and we finally figured out

1044
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,640
the optimum thickness of silicon dioxide

1045
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:12,000
and haia to make a silicon dioxide half

1046
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:16,079
silicon dioxide a stack and once we do

1047
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
that we suddenly managed to entirely

1048
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,000
compensate the linear and second order

1049
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,640
temperature dependency and then here's

1050
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,240
the measurements you can see the

1051
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,000
uncompensated one you can see the quartz

1052
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,880
and then this is when we stack it with

1053
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,760
silicon

1054
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,839
dioxide the significance of this result

1055
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,079
is after 90 years of the discovery of

1056
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:38,800
the at cot

1057
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:42,480
quartz which is the reason that we use

1058
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:46,559
at cot quartz to make a stable Crystal

1059
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,000
clocks we managed to make a seos based

1060
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:52,440
resonator that has a better temperature

1061
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,920
stability so if you compare the blue one

1062
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:59,000
which is the haia oxide fully seos

1063
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,079
materials and you compare it with quartz

1064
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,079
an

1065
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,720
unintegrated kind kind of a component

1066
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,680
you do see that yes we manage to go

1067
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,800
above temperature stability of the

1068
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,720
quartz and that opens up a whole lot of

1069
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,960
opportunities because in future instead

1070
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,559
of making a processor that requires an

1071
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,200
external quartz clock maybe you can just

1072
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:22,760
make the clocks at top of your Computing

1073
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,960
course instead of relying on a single

1074
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,720
clock well for each of these Computing

1075
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,599
cores for AI you can rely on a separate

1076
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:33,559
independent clock okay so that that

1077
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,400
opens up a whole lot of opportunities

1078
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:39,160
but there's still a major challenge when

1079
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,079
it comes to using these haia oxide for

1080
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,559
clock generation and the problem is

1081
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,200
already seen you see that let's say

1082
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,440
although the temperature characteristics

1083
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,680
shows very stable but when you look into

1084
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,599
the shortterm fluctuations it's very

1085
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:57,800
noisy why is that well the fact that the

1086
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:00,800
line withd is kind of fluctuating it's

1087
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,960
actually nearly 1 PPM of short-term

1088
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,760
instability is because of the quality

1089
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,280
Factor yes the quality factor of halfa

1090
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,119
resonator is good but is still not even

1091
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,920
close to quartz quartz typically is tens

1092
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,400
of thousands at the same frequency of

1093
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:17,880
these resonators that show a que of

1094
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,880
nearly 500 to 600 how can we solve it

1095
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:24,240
and here comes my last

1096
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:27,680
slide you can solve it and the way to

1097
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:31,200
solve it is the fact that you can unlo

1098
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,359
the very unique mechanical properties of

1099
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,720
semiconductors as soon as you put your

1100
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,440
half or ferroelectric besides

1101
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:41,400
semiconductor materials you can benefit

1102
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,400
from unique features of semiconductors

1103
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,359
one of them is a concept called

1104
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,599
self-amplification

1105
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:49,920
self-amplification is actually if you

1106
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:54,119
think about

1107
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,240
semiconductors if you dope them and type

1108
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,359
and if you apply a DC current through

1109
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,440
them

1110
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,319
because of the P resistivity of a

1111
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,760
semiconductor and also because of the

1112
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:05,880
termal expansion coefficient that

1113
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,240
typically once you heat it up through

1114
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,240
applying the electric field it is

1115
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,599
becomes larger and then a smaller

1116
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,200
depending on the sinusoidal voltage that

1117
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:18,000
is applied you can come up with some

1118
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,440
sort of energy pumping mechanism that is

1119
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,400
called pisor resistive heat engine not

1120
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,880
going to go much into the details of it

1121
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,720
but in short if you make a super lattice

1122
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,800
of endo silicon and silicon germanium

1123
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,520
you manage to get very

1124
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,559
large and highly efficient P resistive

1125
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,040
heat engines and the significance of

1126
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:43,880
these heat engines is you can apply a DC

1127
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,839
current and they automatically can boost

1128
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,880
the quality factor of any resonator

1129
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:51,799
fabricated in

1130
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:55,119
them so we tried the substrate we put

1131
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:58,000
our fero electric trans p Electric uh

1132
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,119
transducer at top of this um super

1133
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,240
lattice and we appli the DC current we

1134
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,839
tuned the properties to provide very

1135
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,880
large self-amplification and we managed

1136
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,200
to benefit from this unique feature of

1137
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,400
semiconductor to amplify the cube from

1138
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,440
1,500 all the way to 5,000 and beyond

1139
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,280
that the peak becomes so much nonlinear

1140
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,520
that was not even possible to measure it

1141
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,400
which means that yes the que is low but

1142
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,760
the fact that you are close to

1143
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,359
semiconductors opens up a whole new

1144
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,559
regimes of operations including the self

1145
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:30,559
ampov ification mechanism that helps to

1146
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,640
boost the queue and cover some of the

1147
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,960
issues that you may have with the

1148
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,720
quality factor of haa

1149
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,720
resonators with that I would like to

1150
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,000
conclude my talk so we talked about non

1151
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,480
mechanical resonators and why they're

1152
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,240
indispensable although they're

1153
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,680
mechanical components but they're

1154
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,599
indispensable in modern electronic

1155
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,079
Microsystems we talked about how to make

1156
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:56,280
resonators based on all of seos

1157
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:59,119
materials specifically if a new type of

1158
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,640
P electric or fero electric um

1159
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,480
transducer haia that is processed to

1160
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,119
have polar morphology we demonstrated

1161
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,119
new resonator architectur such as the th

1162
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,720
ferroelectric gate th acoustic

1163
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,200
resonators that enables massive

1164
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,880
integration of resonators and they

1165
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,119
scaling all the way into tens of

1166
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,200
gigahertz we demonstrated how you can

1167
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:21,000
temperature compensate and halfa a halfa

1168
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,640
resonator to get a better temperature

1169
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,319
stability uh compared to at cut quartz

1170
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,240
and then finally we demonstrated the

1171
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,280
significance of having

1172
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,200
a

1173
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,000
a seos based fed electric beside the

1174
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,599
semiconductor to benefit from

1175
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,559
semiconductor unique characteristics one

1176
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,799
example is self-amplification mechanism

1177
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,160
for enhancement of the quality Factor so

1178
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:43,799
I would like to um recognize the

1179
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,839
contribution of all of my students and

1180
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:48,079
the groups who did all of these research

1181
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,240
and also um our our nonscale research

1182
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,839
facility and the sponsors and I'm open

1183
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,400
for questions thank you thank

1184
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,920
you thanks for your space so we have

1185
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,119
time time for a couple of questions

1186
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,119
anyone in the room wants to

1187
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:09,240
start hello hi Jessica from kadur from

1188
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,119
Quantum coherent Electronics group are

1189
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,000
you just describing a parametric

1190
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,799
amplifier Q multiplier in your last

1191
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,319
slide um well it's not necessarily A

1192
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:19,920
parametric amplification parametric

1193
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,040
amplification is when you tune a

1194
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,440
specific part of your oscillator at a

1195
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,799
certain frequency you benefit from the

1196
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,440
nonlinearity to boost that this is

1197
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:31,520
another mechanic and the mechanism Works

1198
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,359
based on the back action of the thermal

1199
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,400
expansion versus the negative P

1200
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,599
resistivity so the way that it works is

1201
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,000
if you apply a a current across the uh

1202
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:43,160
material that has a negative P resistive

1203
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,480
coefficient once it becomes hot it

1204
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,760
expands and when it become expands

1205
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,960
because of the negative P resistivity

1206
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,280
its resistance reduces so you pass more

1207
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,920
current into it so this becomes like a

1208
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,599
positive feedback uh so it turns out

1209
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,319
that we typically call it the p

1210
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:00,760
resistive heat engine mechanism indeed a

1211
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:03,520
nonlinear mechanism because you're

1212
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,599
applying a DC but you are not really

1213
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,720
tuning a a specific part of your

1214
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,799
oscillator so I in my opinion it's not

1215
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,880
necessarily the parametric

1216
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:16,599
amplification okay I I have a couple

1217
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,280
other

1218
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:22,839
questions

1219
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,880
uh on slide 14 you said that you reduced

1220
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:27,720
the loss to minus 20 but it looked like

1221
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,680
it was minus 40 am I not understanding

1222
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,119
that no that's right that's right I mean

1223
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,359
the devices that I'm showing here is in

1224
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,839
that range okay but but you manag to

1225
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,640
improve it by probably scaling the size

1226
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:41,319
this specific resonator is very narrow

1227
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,319
we have a very small aperture but with

1228
00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:45,400
resonators that are larger in size such

1229
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:48,240
as this

1230
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:52,440
one we can go all the way to minus 25 or

1231
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:55,119
minus 20 yes okay and then I one last

1232
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,760
question on uh slide

1233
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,880
25 I was just just curious it looks like

1234
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,880
your rejection is about maybe 15 DB can

1235
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,119
you talk about the rejection out of band

1236
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,240
rejection a little bit rejection in the

1237
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,440
order of minus 20 DB out of band

1238
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,359
rejection and the rejection is basically

1239
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,640
defined depending on the number of the

1240
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:14,960
resonators that you have so when we talk

1241
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,799
about rejection we basically have a

1242
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,280
ladder of capacitors because we're out

1243
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:21,920
of band we're not experiencing the

1244
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,480
mechanical resonance and we can always

1245
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,520
tune the rejection depending on the

1246
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,160
relative area of the shant element in

1247
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,040
our filters relative to the series foru

1248
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:35,280
a specific type of resonators if you

1249
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,640
look into them the area of shant is

1250
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,200
typically twice or one and a half times

1251
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,520
the area of the resonator in series and

1252
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,640
by increasing that if you go to twice so

1253
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,119
if you increase the size of these we can

1254
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:50,680
improve the rejection at the cost of

1255
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,680
losing a little bit of the pass band um

1256
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,880
so so there always a tradeoff but but we

1257
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,240
clearly have to do a whole lot of you

1258
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,520
know engine ing to just get a to tweak

1259
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,640
the best filter architecture and then

1260
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,280
Define the electrodes accordingly do you

1261
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,000
have a do you have a sense for what your

1262
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,400
ultimate rejection is possible to

1263
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,799
achieve if you allow me to have an

1264
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,839
insertion loss PM of 10 DB we can get

1265
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:14,559
into 100 DB of rejection right because

1266
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:16,520
you can Cascade these filters after each

1267
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,680
other right and then once you Cascade

1268
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,000
them rejection becomes multiplied but

1269
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:24,040
the pass band insertion loss is also

1270
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,760
increase so at the end of the day we can

1271
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,880
improve the rejection the problem we

1272
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,799
have is on insertion loss is still quite

1273
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,599
large like five or 6 TB and one of the

1274
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:35,400
reasons is all of these metallic kind of

1275
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,640
uh routings at that frequency is really

1276
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,680
lossy so well we have to first of all

1277
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,319
make them much closer together because

1278
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,680
there there's too much of loss right I

1279
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:45,280
mean this is a whole lot of loss I mean

1280
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,440
there's no reason to make the fins that

1281
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,240
far apart um and then we can start to

1282
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,680
think about okay how can we improve the

1283
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,119
filter rejection and at the same time

1284
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:58,880
improving the the ppan insertion loss

1285
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,880
thank thank you

1286
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,000
sure thank thank you for a very nice

1287
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,799
talk U looks like your materials

1288
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,960
themselves are are doing amazing things

1289
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,920
I was wondering for your your

1290
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,359
nanolaminate structure you mentioned

1291
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,280
you're trying to keep a large degree of

1292
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,520
tensile stress yes even after releasing

1293
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,480
do you know how large the tensil stress

1294
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,400
is I would I would almost expect for

1295
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,520
that thickness the large tensil stress

1296
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,119
the layer would crack yes yes very good

1297
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,720
point so if you measure the tensile

1298
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:33,240
stress for the unreleased structure

1299
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,720
residual stress in the film is as large

1300
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,680
as 2 gigapascal it's huge stress once

1301
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,599
you release it it becomes in the order

1302
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,440
of 500

1303
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:45,720
megapascal it doesn't crack and it was

1304
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,000
surprising to us because you expect this

1305
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,160
is like a ceramic material right and

1306
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,599
then should be supposedly pretail but it

1307
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,720
turns out that once you scale these

1308
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,079
materials down well the idea that we

1309
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,039
have from bre turn material does not

1310
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,599
hold that these such lower thicknesses

1311
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:02,119
to the point that we even pressed it

1312
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:04,119
with a probe and I don't have a movie

1313
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:06,400
with myself but we did push it with

1314
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:09,000
probe and it never broke it BEC like a

1315
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,599
plastic it became like a so bent and

1316
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,039
nothing happened to it so it really

1317
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:17,280
withand this much of a stress and uh

1318
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:20,200
well we have to see if he age it for

1319
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,000
like a one year what's going to happen

1320
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:27,000
but so far we haven't seen a cracking

1321
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
incident thank

1322
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,799
great talk thank you very much um um I

1323
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:38,319
understand the applications of the

1324
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:40,920
Precision and accuracy of this higher

1325
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:43,599
threshold of Technology what are some of

1326
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:46,359
the cool areas where it's not

1327
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:50,200
necessarily semiconductor or military

1328
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:53,079
for example with um solid state

1329
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:56,520
batteries does battery management need

1330
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:00,960
this kind of accuracy and precision in

1331
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:03,200
in life sciences uh as they are doing

1332
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,280
more and more investigation on the

1333
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:09,079
clocks related to aging can something

1334
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:12,640
like this be applied in

1335
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:14,640
silico so to give an answer I just first

1336
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,079
give an answer to the second question

1337
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,960
well when we talk about uh if you think

1338
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:21,880
about life sciences to be honest as an

1339
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,599
engineer I typically look into how they

1340
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,920
made a stuff right I mean we get

1341
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,400
inspired because in my opinion nature is

1342
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,200
probably the best engineer he's already

1343
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,720
engineered things that are much better

1344
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,720
and some of these materials are

1345
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,440
engineered according to what nature does

1346
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,680
for example the temperature compensation

1347
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,760
that we we we we had the mixture of

1348
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,599
silicon and hco the idea came from

1349
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,559
quartz quartz is a material that is in

1350
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:47,240
nature and for the same reason that qu

1351
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:49,880
becomes a temperature stable we figured

1352
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,240
out because it's a a multimorph material

1353
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,000
well we figured out the same thing can

1354
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,200
happen in haia regarding the first

1355
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,200
question um other type of a applications

1356
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,240
energy storage probably maybe not well

1357
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,559
you can think about modalities where the

1358
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:09,839
bending of these resonators can be used

1359
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:11,720
to store the energy um not with p

1360
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,720
Electric property but there are other

1361
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,400
type of behaviors in the same material

1362
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,599
one of them is pyroelectric effect

1363
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,160
pyroelectric effect is the same

1364
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,480
ferroelectric material if you apply a

1365
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,440
temperature gradient it generates charge

1366
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,880
which means that well there are chances

1367
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:29,520
that you can benefit from those type of

1368
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,799
behaviors for energy Scavenging but at

1369
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:35,599
the end of the day maybe not a direct

1370
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:38,160
relevance but having a frequency

1371
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:41,000
reference is always needed for a lot of

1372
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,720
applications including some systems that

1373
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,640
that enables um energy storage or energy

1374
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,640
Scavenging

1375
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,920
sure maybe I'll end with one question

1376
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,559
from our online audience uh so there's a

1377
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,799
question that's asking you compared haia

1378
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,400
zerconia to aluminum nitrate and said

1379
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:04,880
the indicator is much better for haia

1380
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,839
zerconia but in your case uh half zonia

1381
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,880
is per electric and aluminum nitride is

1382
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:11,079
p Electric could you give more

1383
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,599
explanation on how to compare these two

1384
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:15,920
materials it's great question so let me

1385
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,480
go back to the

1386
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,760
slide six maybe so what is the

1387
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:26,280
difference between P electricity and fer

1388
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:29,440
electricity so I start this way

1389
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,039
any material that is polarized in their

1390
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,880
molecular structure is

1391
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:37,319
petric right what do we mean by

1392
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,680
polarized it means that if you apply a

1393
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:41,720
strain the center of gravity for

1394
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,680
positive charges does

1395
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,359
not coincide with the center of gravity

1396
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,200
for negative charges that means that

1397
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:50,480
okay if you apply the stress you're

1398
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:53,160
making an internal dipole into inside

1399
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,079
your material that translates to the

1400
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,240
charge right so the p Electric effect

1401
00:59:55,079 --> 01:00:01,039
you apply a stress you induce

1402
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,359
charge ferroelectric

1403
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:06,799
materials are polarized but you can

1404
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:09,079
switch their polarization which means

1405
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:11,680
that yes there are even probably a

1406
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:15,400
broader range of material there are an

1407
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:18,599
umbrella that they do show P electricity

1408
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:20,119
because they are polarized but not only

1409
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:22,280
they are polarized but also their

1410
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:23,799
polarization Direction can be switched

1411
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,799
and what does it mean by switching the

1412
01:00:23,799 --> 01:00:28,760
polarization Direction it means that if

1413
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:30,960
you previously applied a stress and you

1414
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:33,599
induce a specific negative charge across

1415
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,000
a capacitor in same direction if you now

1416
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,160
apply a DC and switch to polarization

1417
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,440
apply the same strain you can in induce

1418
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,440
a negative an opposite sign of the

1419
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,960
charge so that's basically the

1420
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:48,079
difference so again any sort of material

1421
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,440
that is polar is p Electric

1422
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,400
ferroelectrics are pis electrics that

1423
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,280
their polarization can be switched up

1424
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,319
and down so the placement of the atom

1425
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,839
there is a loose atom there that upon

1426
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,920
application of electric field could move

1427
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:03,039
up or move down that's why p Electric

1428
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,599
materials are typically used for

1429
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:07,920
transduction mechanisms photoelectric

1430
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,640
materials besides the transaction can be

1431
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,280
used for memory because if you can

1432
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:14,480
switch something on and up well it could

1433
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:18,160
be a state of one and zero okay so

1434
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:22,640
that's the difference excellent so let's

1435
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,240
thank rusbe for a great talk thank you R

1436
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,240

1437
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,160
reception so feel free to stay around

1438
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:32,640
here so he can talk to him more thank

1439
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,640
you all for joining
