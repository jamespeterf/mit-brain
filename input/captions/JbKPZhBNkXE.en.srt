1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,319
My my time at Sloan was before Chat GPT

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,799
existed, but I think of my classmates as

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,880
the early version of that where, you

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
know, I was interviewing for during the

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,880
course semester for my summer internship

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,120
at various pharma companies and I didn't

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
even know what some of the acronyms and

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,560
ways that they solve problems were

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,320
versus I had colleagues who had been

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,160
working in life sciences consulting who

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
had come from these companies and you

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,840
know I could just put in the chat, hey

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
what does market access actually mean or

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,199
how would you think about this problem

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
or does anyone know of any other drugs

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,520
that had to launch in the last five

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,680
years in a, you know, accelerated

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,440
approval framework and I could just get

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,360
really quick answers from my classmates

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,000
and everyone was not only willing to

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,840
just give the data but also sit down,

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
talk to me, walk me through it, help me

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
prepare for these interviews in a way

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,079
that, you know, got me upskilled really

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,079
fast.

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,600
Welcome everyone. My name is Terrell

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,920
Williams and I serve as one of the

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,359
associate directors here at MIT Sloan

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,960
and I want to welcome you to Thursdays

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
with Terrell. Today's session is going

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
to focus on the power of alumni

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
engagement. So without further ado, I'll

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
go ahead and uh pass it over to my first

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,920
guest for the evening, Greg. And I'll

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,360
have Greg introduce himself, a little

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
bit about his role and how long he's

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,119
been here at MIT Sloan.

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,799
>> Great. Thank you so much, Terrell. My

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,960
name is Greg Bachelor. I'm the interim

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,880
director of strategic alumni engagement

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,960
here at MIT Sloan in the office of

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,240
external relations. So, I've been at

43
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,880
Sloan since 2018, though I started my

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,680
career at MIT in the Central MIT Alumni

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,520
Association started in 2011. So, the

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
time flies, but I'm thrilled to be here

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,640
and to have my home here at Sloan. So,

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,640
happy to be with everyone today.

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,759
So, MIT Salon I was working in um the

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
biotech space um specifically in the

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,680
regulatory affairs that's the group that

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,560
interacts between pharmaceutical

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,479
companies and the global regulators um I

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,599
had spent about 10 to 15 years doing

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,200
that um and prior to that I was I'm a

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,959
pharmacist by training um and I decided

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,040
to come to Sloan because I wanted to get

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,640
a better understanding of strategy and

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,360
finance around biotech and and early

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,319
startups within the life sciences space.

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,959
Um I graduated in 2024 from the Sloan

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,000
Fellows MBA program. Transformative

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,200
experience spending the year at Sloan.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,720
Picked up skills that I didn't think I I

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,160
um that that I didn't think was going to

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,879
be offered such as skills around

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,200
leadership and it was uh it was a a

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,400
thing that I I I highly recommend and

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,400
completely transformed my life.

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
>> Thank you, Lawrence. Then I will pass it

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,040
over to Marissa.

72
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
>> Thank you. Um, welcome everyone. My name

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,640
is Marissa Constat. Prior to Sloan, I

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,040
worked in academic um, medical health

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,440
and in research programs and clinical

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,920
research and global health. And I came

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
to Sloan to pivot into industry. And

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,400
since I graduated in 2021 from the

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
full-time MBA program, I've been at

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
Vert.Ex Pharmaceuticals in the global

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,640
pricing and market access strategy

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,040
function. And for everyone's awareness,

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,959
I live here in Boston and I'm also a

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,599
board member on the Sloan Boston Alumni

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,200
Association in charge of um organizing

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,200
recent alumni events and alumni

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,000
engagement. So excited to talk to you

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,680
all today.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,680
>> And DK, I'll pass it to you to wrap us

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
up.

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,200
>> Hey there, my name's uh Dave.

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,400
Uh can everyone hear me well?

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,799
Okay. Um, so prior to Sloan, I uh went

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,879
to undergrad at UCSB where I got a

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
degree in electrical engineering. I was

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,840
there went to the military for four

97
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,640
years. as an engineering officer, left

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,680
out, served as a project manager with

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,840
Motorola Solutions. Um where at that

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,280
point I decided to get my MBA for

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,560
product management and what's afterwards

102
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,400
um ended up going to currently at um

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
Microsoft where I work as an AI product

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,720
manager.

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
>> Thank you all for sharing. So Greg, I

106
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
want to pass it back over to you for our

107
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
first question for a moderated session.

108
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,759
Um, can you share an overview of the

109
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199
office of external relations? This may

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
be the first time that our audience is

111
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
hearing this term. So, can you share its

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
role in supporting the MIT Stone's

113
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,479
mission and kind of your roles and

114
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,960
responsibilities within that office?

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,800
>> Yeah, thank you. Um, so first, the

116
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,120
office of external relations kind of

117
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
mission statement is to engage students,

118
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,000
alumni, and friends with one another and

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
MIT Sloan to really inspire the

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,400
investment of time, expertise, and

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
financial support. So I like to boil it

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,160
down as it's about community and

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,040
building the network and it's also about

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,199
philanthropy. So I work on the strategic

125
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,560
alumni engagement team. So we're really

126
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,440
focusing on the network and

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,080
volunteerism. So we work with alumni all

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,479
over the world who want to support the

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,560
school and stay engaged. So we do that

130
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,880
through events, through volunteerism.

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
Some of our big events are marquee

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
annual events like reunion where we're

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,320
bringing alumni back to campus and

134
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,080
reconnecting with their classmates. Um,

135
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,080
and we really put a big focus on

136
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,639
intellectual programming and faculty

137
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,160
events. We also support regional club

138
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
volunteers. So, I'm thrilled Marissa's

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,320
here to talk about the Sloan Boston

140
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,880
alumni association. We also work with

141
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,479
other volunteer groups around the world.

142
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,000
And then, of course, Terrell, you're

143
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,520
with admissions, but we support the

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,360
admissions team. We support other

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
departments at Sloan like the career

146
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,440
development office and our action

147
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
learning team. So really keeping alumni

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,720
connected to all of the other

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,080
departments across the school as well

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,680
and fueling the ecosystem here. So I

151
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,000
mentioned to philanthropy we are a

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,080
fundraising organization. MIT Sloan

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
wouldn't exist without the generosity of

154
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
our alumni who give back not only their

155
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,479
time but also their financial support.

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,800
So that's for things like fellowship,

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,960
the Sloan annual fund and also for

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,039
faculty research. So it's engagement,

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
it's volunteerism, it's philanthropy,

160
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,160
it's all connected. So, it's really the

161
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,600
whole whole ecosystem there.

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
>> Thank you for sharing, Greg. I I'll stay

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
with you for a moment. So, could you

164
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
share um some additional trends that

165
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,000
you're noticing in how alumni prefer to

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,639
stay connected to the school?

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,160
>> Sure. Sure. Um this may not be a trend

168
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,560
necessarily, but I think one of the

169
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,120
things that's a true differentiator for

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
MIT Sloan, our alumni love to be

171
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,960
together. We have really smart people

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,720
who want to do big things, and when you

173
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,039
bring them together, uh the magic

174
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,280
happens. So, um, you know, I think

175
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,960
prioritizing that intellectual content,

176
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,039
you'll see that in all of our events,

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,639
you'll see it at reunion, that feeling

178
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,880
of being back in the classroom and

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,720
always learning together. I think our

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,120
alumni really want to be on the cutting

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,960
edge of new research. So, um, you know,

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,759
not a trend, but definitely something

183
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,319
that's, uh, you know, a differentiator

184
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,240
for our Sloan alumni community. The

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,680
learning doesn't stop. [laughter]

186
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
>> Awesome. Thank you for sharing, Greg.

187
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
So, now I want to pass over to our

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,479
alumni guests here as well. So just I

189
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,840
know we touched on this during your

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,759
introductions, but can you all kind of

191
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,160
share some additional insight on you

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,800
know what led you to ultimately enroll

193
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,800
at MIT Sloan?

194
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,599
>> I can kick us off. Um for me I I found

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
that there were a lot of different

196
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,039
reasons people were going to business

197
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,880
school and and for me I was pivoting

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,599
into industry for the first time. I'd

199
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,759
never worked for a public corporation.

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,720
Um, and I really wanted the intellectual

201
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,039
chops to to really stand up to to what

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,960
I'd done. I'd studied communication in

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,120
undergrad, but I didn't have the

204
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
technical uh background that a lot of

205
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,479
folks have coming into Sloan. And so, I

206
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,000
really wanted to double down on the the

207
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,479
quantitative skills, and I felt like

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
Sloan was a unique way to both do that

209
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,759
in school and to leverage the reputation

210
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,919
of MIT um further uh for my employers in

211
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,919
the future.

212
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,199
Thank you.

213
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,440
>> Yeah, I think for me it's a two-part. I

214
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
think the first part is for the MIT and

215
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,879
the second part is for the people.

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,960
Initially when I knew I wanted to get an

217
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,720
NBA and as I started to look at

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,199
different programs I was like hey I

219
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,599
really want a quantitative program that

220
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,039
can dive down really get into the weeds

221
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,440
with the technical aspects of

222
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,759
everything. And so as I went through the

223
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,120
list MIT definitely stuck out as one of

224
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
those who had like great tech

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,279
placements. Um but what really

226
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,279
solidified it for me is the more I

227
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,279
interacted with these different schools

228
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,440
um the mantra like Sloan's helping Sloan

229
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,920
it's really true um there are so many

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,600
kind nice nice people I met uh who had

231
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,880
amazing background that network like

232
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,880
this is definitely spot for me

233
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,000
>> yeah um I think the main reason that I

234
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,000
chose MIT Sloan was

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,839
twofolded. I think the first thing was

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,480
that coming from a true technical

237
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,600
background as a pharmacist by training.

238
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,519
I really value the technical approach to

239
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,080
management that um MIT Sloan um had

240
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,959
within the course and how they wanted to

241
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,880
approach um just teaching management in

242
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,360
general. Um I wanted to be um at MIT

243
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,040
because of the the the connection that

244
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
they had to the biotech space in

245
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,399
general. So I think you know the overall

246
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,080
MIT ecosystem um there's a lot of great

247
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
labs and a lot of vape professors who

248
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,279
helped launch a number of pharmaceutical

249
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,279
companies and then I think the the thing

250
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,120
that stood out to me really stood out to

251
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,720
me a lot was the principal leadership

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,519
aspect the values associated with being

253
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,480
um a Sloan I think that you know I think

254
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,240
the intention associated with how we

255
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,040
interact with the overall business

256
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,519
community I valued a lot and I wanted to

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,399
continue to kind of live that in my in

258
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,080
my next role.

259
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,519
>> Thank you all for sharing. D, can you

260
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,200
touched on something that I was going to

261
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,200
ask anyway, but I'm happy you shared the

262
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,760
Sloan helping Sloan ethos that we have

263
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,560
here. So, uh, could you all share some

264
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,959
examples of what that looks like before

265
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,800
someone's time at Sloan, during someone

266
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,360
time at Sloan, or even after they

267
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,360
graduate from Sloan?

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,920
>> Nico, you can go ahead and kick us off.

269
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,839
>> Yeah, I can definitely start with that.

270
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,320
So um I'll start with the uh before

271
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,959
Sloan. So before Sloan one thing like I

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,160
said the network community really drove

273
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,160
me to apply and accept here but there

274
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
were a handful of people who as I

275
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
reached out like hey I'm applying to

276
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,079
this school can you help me out? Um

277
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,519
there's this program um it's called plug

278
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,880
now plug g um it's a small club but

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,120
essentially um there are current

280
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
students who go through actually help

281
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,600
and assist before getting into the

282
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,000
school. Hey, let me look at your

283
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,040
applications help you out was primarily

284
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,360
for um marginalized communities. And so

285
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,480
for me being a Latino, I really love

286
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,120
that I felt um a sense of community

287
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,880
there even before heading to Sloan and

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
after Sloan um was actually funny. The

289
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,920
reason I'm actually at Microsoft is

290
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,720
because of another Sloan. Um she was

291
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,480
also for a grant and I think when I was

292
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,959
applying for work I was like hey where's

293
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
the best place I can apply to? Um, so

294
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,399
many Sloanies gave me referrals. They

295
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,920
like connected me with their hiring

296
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,680
managers. They really set me up and so

297
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,079
honestly wouldn't today without other

298
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,519
Sloan. Uh, which is once again one of

299
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,519
the biggest reasons I chose the school.

300
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,200
>> Yeah. I mean I I want to add also like I

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,839
I came to Sloan without any business

302
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,920
acronym or background. Um so when I

303
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,360
stepped into the classroom I think you

304
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:02,079
know there's this finance there was um

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,079
um courses that I hadn't um DMD there's

306
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,680
courses that I hadn't um had a lot of

307
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,959
experience with that um we informally

308
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,040
rallied together to kind of dive into

309
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,120
those courses from strategy courses to

310
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,120
finance courses to kind of you know help

311
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,839
each other get through the classwork and

312
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,680
I think that's really one of the strong

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,680
um uh um facets about the people that

314
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,760
end up coming to Sloan, right? Is that

315
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,399
they truly believe in this Sloan helping

316
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,440
Sloan and um I realized earlier I didn't

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,360
mention that I I I launched a a venture

318
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,160
fund and that's what I I'm doing after

319
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,519
Sloan we invest in the biotech space but

320
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,760
one of the ways I was able to launch

321
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,160
that fund was because I partnered with

322
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,800
one of my um Sloan classmates to launch

323
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,639
the venture fund and we kind of came

324
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
together and he provided a lot of

325
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,120
assistance. he's done venture work

326
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,360
before um or VC work before and he kind

327
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
of we partnered together and really was

328
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,160
able to drive the the launch of the

329
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,880
venture fund. So, um yeah, it just

330
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,360
speaks to like the type of people that

331
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,720
um that Sloan accepts and the desire to

332
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,720
kind of support each other through these

333
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
endeavors.

334
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,480
Maybe one thing I'll add is um how much

335
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,279
I learned from my fellow Sloan both in

336
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,920
school and and since then. Um, you know,

337
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,320
there's this was before my my time at

338
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,000
Sloan was before Chat GPT existed, but I

339
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,480
think of my classmates as the early

340
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
version of that where, you know, I was

341
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
interviewing for during the course

342
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
semester for my summer internship at

343
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,240
various pharma companies and I didn't

344
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,399
even know what some of the acronyms and

345
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,760
ways that they solve problems were

346
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,440
versus I had colleagues who had been

347
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,360
working in life sciences consulting who

348
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,959
had come from these companies and you

349
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
know I could just put in the chat, hey,

350
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,560
what does market access actually mean or

351
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,320
how would you think about this problem

352
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,639
or does anyone know of any other drugs

353
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,120
that have had to launch in the last five

354
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,120
years in a you know accelerated approval

355
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,040
framework and I could just get really

356
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
quick answers from my classmates and

357
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,600
everyone was not only willing to just

358
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,360
give the data but also sit down talk to

359
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,519
me walk me through it help me prepare

360
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,560
for these interviews in a way that you

361
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,959
know got me upskilled really fast and I

362
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,839
continued to to leverage my peers you

363
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,240
know before um before graduating through

364
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,240
through classes through taking an econ

365
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,279
class or a data class that you know was

366
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,800
brand new material to me. But also, you

367
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,040
know, in my first couple of years of the

368
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,040
job when I had colleagues who had spent

369
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,800
a decade working in life sciences

370
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,079
consulting and had this whole breadth of

371
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
knowledge that they could point me in

372
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,440
the right direction really quickly so

373
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,639
that I could be better and more

374
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,639
effective in my job as well.

375
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,920
>> Thank you all for sharing. Greg, I want

376
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
to start with you on this next question.

377
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
Um, you touched on this earlier about

378
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
your collaboration with the admissions

379
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,760
office. So, could you share how alumni

380
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,079
interacts with newly admitted students

381
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,839
before the program begins and how Sloan

382
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,160
encourages those early connections to

383
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,399
shape those student outcomes?

384
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,320
>> Yeah, thanks Terrell and a big kudos to

385
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
your team for helping facilitate those

386
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,240
connections. Um, but I think

387
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,440
specifically about our Sloan alumni

388
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,320
board. So, a key um volunteer group for

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,639
us who are active and willing to do

390
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,639
admit calling. So, you know, again, your

391
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,279
team provides the structure uh and the

392
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,120
outreach opportunity, but really to have

393
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,360
alumni who are willing to call admitted

394
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,519
students and share their experience and

395
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,199
kind of put their minds at ease, right?

396
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,880
To be hearing from folks who have walked

397
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,120
through the doors of MIT Sloan before

398
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,720
you and get those firsthand experiences,

399
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
I think is incredibly invaluable. And

400
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,000
our alumni are always willing to make

401
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,160
those calls um and make those

402
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,160
connections. So, that of course comes to

403
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
mind first for me uh and appreciate the

404
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,040
partnership with admissions on that.

405
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,240
Awesome. I know we have some uh newly

406
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,920
admitted students on our call, so I'm

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,920
pretty sure they, you know, had those co

408
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,040
contacts from our alumni and and as well

409
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,560
as some current students as well to kind

410
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,480
of talk about the experience here, kind

411
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,320
of help them with their transition. Um,

412
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
passing about to the alumni panel along

413
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,240
those same lines from the alumni

414
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,920
perspective. Um, how can incoming

415
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,240
students best take advantage of the

416
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,399
Sloan experience inside and outside of

417
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,399
the classroom?

418
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,880
Yeah, I would say I would say one of the

419
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,480
things that um was recommended um to do

420
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,279
um while I was at Sloan is to have these

421
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,360
informational interviews, right? And I

422
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,680
think um a lot of the Sloan alumni is is

423
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,320
is always open to having these

424
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,959
conversations with um current Sloan

425
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,880
students and you can leverage LinkedIn

426
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,560
or you can leverage the professors to

427
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,800
connect you with the alumni and I would

428
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,360
say it's I would say to start with

429
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,519
exploration conversations with with the

430
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,519
alumni um space. So these informational

431
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,600
interviews you go in trying to learn and

432
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,199
understand exactly what people are doing

433
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,199
right now. What was their experience?

434
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,000
How did they go from Sloan to their

435
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,240
current role and from the majority of

436
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,199
you know my experience and also my other

437
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,959
classmates MIT Sloan alumni is they

438
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,600
really take that Sloan's helping Sloan's

439
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:09,240
not just at Sloan but they take it post

440
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,240
Sloan into the alumni um um space. Also,

441
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,439
>> I think another underutilized resource

442
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,520
at Sloan is the faculty. Um, one of the

443
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,319
reasons that I ended up choosing um,

444
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,199
Sloan was one of the faculty members was

445
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,199
doing research on um, how to apply

446
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
financial models of diversification and

447
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,919
investing and and hedge fund management

448
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,919
to cancer research and how some of those

449
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
similar concepts could, you know, not

450
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,000
only create sustainable biotechnology

451
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,320
companies but have better results in the

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,720
from the scientific standpoint. And it

453
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,000
was so fascinating to me and obviously I

454
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,480
immediately wanted to take this

455
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,799
professor's class but on top of that you

456
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,880
know I was intimidated to to ask for his

457
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,960
one-on-one time but he was willing to

458
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
give it with you know open arms you know

459
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,120
for office hours for for having lunch

460
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,120
occasionally talking about my career

461
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,039
choices content in his class I was

462
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,480
interested in and a few of us actually

463
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,320
ended up becoming fairly close with

464
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,919
these similar interests and I know one

465
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
of my friends ended up writing a paper

466
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,440
with him that year. you know, these

467
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,120
aren't things that you typically do as

468
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,640
an MBA student, but if it's something

469
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,960
that you're interested in and there's a

470
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,880
faculty member studying it, they're so

471
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,960
willing to give you their time. And that

472
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
has gone on as alumni as well. I still

473
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,640
meet with um that small group of

474
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,880
students and we have like quarterly or

475
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,440
so once or twice a year maybe um through

476
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,200
the years we we have dinner together. Um

477
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,600
I I work with some of these faculty

478
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,760
members as an alumni member to do alumni

479
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,520
lectures and yeah they're they're so

480
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,039
willing to give their time if if you're

481
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,360
interested in coming to them with kind

482
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,360
of real career questions and and ideas

483
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,520
like Hey, what year is my graduate? What

484
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:04,640
industry graduate?

485
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,799
Uh when I was recruiting this huge help

486
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,400
like hey where can I best like be

487
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,480
connected

488
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,480
create resource that I feel like is

489
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
underutilized.

490
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
>> Awesome. Thank you all for sharing. We

491
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,200
had a little bit of trouble hearing you

492
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,760
at the last part but I'll let you start

493
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,400
this next question. um as it pertains to

494
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,640
your um connection to the community

495
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,799
postgraduation. So, I know you're a part

496
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
of the um the Sloan Affinity Group

497
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,320
alumni serving as one of the

498
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,000
co-presidents. So, could you share um

499
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,840
what strategies have helped you build

500
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,720
lasting relationships within the alumni

501
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,520
community?

502
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,440
So some things that I do uh one from a

503
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:51,200
social aspect is there's a groups one of

504
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,280
five groups where every last five years

505
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,960
depending on your area you're in SF

506
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,799
you're in LA you can definitely get

507
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,880
tapped into that group and they have

508
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,559
events all the time going on where you

509
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,080
can connect with others. Um also like by

510
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,440
class we have a group chat where like

511
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,919
hey everyone from Boston class of 2024

512
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,120
get to hang out get together and do

513
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,880
different aspects. Um so I think those

514
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,360
are some really good ways I stay

515
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:23,120
connected but from the I guess more of a

516
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,039
develop side. So I joined u uh it's a

517
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
small affinity alumni group from

518
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,919
affinity clubs. So, if you're part of a

519
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,440
ABC, the African Business Club, uh BBSA,

520
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,480
the Black Business Student Association,

521
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,400
or HBC, Hispanic Business Club, um

522
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,320
you're able to join this and be

523
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,799
connected with those from similar

524
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,960
backgrounds. And we do a lot of effort

525
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,640
help with current students, making sure

526
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,520
they feel like they have their resources

527
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,360
necessary. We engage with alumni,

528
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,360
sharing like their specific graduation

529
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,400
events, they're aware of it. So, those

530
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,400
are some ways that I stay.

531
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
Thanks. And Marissa, I'll pass it over

532
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
to you as well. You talked about your

533
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,280
engagement with the Sloan Boston Alumni

534
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,120
Association. So, you can talk about ways

535
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,880
that you've been able to stay connected

536
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,799
um postgraduation and some of the maybe

537
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,799
initiatives that you have led.

538
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,640
>> Yeah, absolutely. So, I've worked really

539
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,960
closely with Greg and his team with the

540
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,679
OEER. Um they have a group called Sloan

541
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,240
5 uh which is really focused on the most

542
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,799
five recent years of alumni and they

543
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,960
provide us with with resources, swag,

544
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,720
funding, everything we need as long as

545
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
you know we can put on an activity and

546
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
invite everyone to join us. And what I

547
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,840
found um over the last 5 years since

548
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,159
I've graduated is that Sloan really want

549
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,000
to get together as Greg touched on. um

550
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
they just often, you know, people are

551
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,760
willing to raise their hand and help or

552
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,600
show up for an event, but they might not

553
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,520
have the bandwidth to kind of own it and

554
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
and put it on to begin with or it's a

555
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,559
little intimidating to think, you know,

556
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,240
what if I put in all this effort and

557
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,840
people don't show up. And so that's

558
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,159
something I've been able to do both from

559
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,480
the the board perspective and also just

560
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,960
as an alumni member. Um, so I've

561
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,120
organized, you know, maybe 10 or so

562
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,840
events, um, since I graduated, ranging

563
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,520
from happy hours in the Boston area and

564
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,280
just trying to keep things both on the

565
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,679
week nights right after work or some

566
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,080
things people preer prefer the weekends

567
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,320
where they can bring their families. Um

568
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,080
and then also giving people something to

569
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,960
to rally around whether we have a

570
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,799
faculty lecture or um you know a new

571
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
book being published and faculty will

572
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,280
come in to sign their book and talk

573
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,559
about it or um a holiday party all the

574
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
different themes. And I think one thing

575
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,880
that's really helped me do that is by

576
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,320
keeping up with these these WhatsApp

577
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
groups and the chats and really finding

578
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,320
out what do people want. Do they just

579
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,159
want a place to meet and get together

580
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,840
and get their own drinks or do they want

581
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,840
something a little more formal to dress

582
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,240
up and go dancing and, you know, have a

583
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,919
holiday party? And so we can provide a

584
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
little bit of everything and constantly,

585
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,200
as you'll learn in course semester,

586
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,919
seeking feedback and acting on that

587
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,000
feedback. Um, is has been a really has

588
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,679
been a really great way to stay engaged

589
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,360
and and to give the community kind of

590
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,600
different reasons to get together. And

591
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,200
it helps us meet other alumni who are

592
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,280
choosing to stay in our same region.

593
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,039
Thank you both for sharing. Greg, I want

594
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,960
to come back to you because I know we're

595
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,880
getting towards the end of the uh the

596
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,720
year, but in the month of January, we do

597
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
have a lot of upcoming initiatives. So,

598
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,679
you know, what are some initiatives that

599
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
you're most excited about as we're going

600
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,640
into this next year?

601
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,600
>> Yeah, thanks. Um the spring of course is

602
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,600
a super busy time at MIT Sloan, but I

603
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,360
think for our office and our team, we

604
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,280
get really excited about thinking about

605
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,760
our graduating students who are about to

606
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,760
enter the alumni community. And so we

607
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,600
put a lot of effort into that transition

608
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,280
and how we talk to students about the

609
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,440
opportunities to stay connected and

610
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,679
engaged. So we do a big alumni

611
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
opportunities fair uh to you know make

612
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,760
those opportunities visible for students

613
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,880
and you know recruiting for volunteer

614
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,360
roles. Um but we also do a Sloan helping

615
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Sloan's spring event every year that is

616
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,200
really around enabling career

617
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,880
conversations. So, I want to emphasize

618
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,799
this isn't transactional like how to get

619
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,799
a job, but it's really bringing students

620
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,360
and alumni together to talk about their

621
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,280
career journeys um and to build that

622
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,919
network and that supportive community

623
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,640
where folks can share best practices and

624
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,200
you know tips and you know how how

625
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,760
they've navigated um their lives and

626
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,919
their careers post MIT Sloan. So, that

627
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,679
happens every spring in partnership with

628
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,679
a number of groups and offices here on

629
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,240
campus. So, we're excited for that as

630
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,320
well. Awesome.

631
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,400
So, I'll have one final question before

632
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,320
we transition to the open Q&A. This

633
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,080
question is for all panelists here. Um,

634
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,279
so this is actually a question that we

635
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,279
got on the registration form that I

636
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,919
wanted to make sure I asked. So,

637
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,679
engaging with alumni is always scary as

638
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
a prospective student. So, you know,

639
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,679
what are some of the ways to ease that

640
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,600
introduction or connection process for

641
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,880
people trying to reach out to alumni as

642
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,000
they're trying to figure out if Son is

643
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
going to be a good place for them for

644
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,799
the next two or maybe even three years

645
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
depending on what programs they're going

646
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,600
into.

647
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,559
I I would I would recommend always to

648
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:03,440
start with um alumni that is in either

649
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,279
in a space that you're currently in or

650
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,640
in a space that you're looking to get

651
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,520
into. Um I think alumni is always ready

652
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,200
to have the conversation around uh the

653
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,520
work that they're doing. Um and I think

654
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,880
it's a great way to initiate that first

655
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,640
initial conversation. Um, and I think

656
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,600
and I also think that like and I think

657
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,440
as you looking as you're looking to um

658
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,679
potentially um apply to MIT Sloan, you

659
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,880
should also look at the different types

660
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,440
of um activities and programs that that

661
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,200
are offered at Sloan and find out if an

662
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,279
alumni has participated in those

663
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,640
activities previously and those things

664
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,880
will help you connect with those

665
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,720
individuals also on the thing that is

666
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,640
that is most interesting to you. I think

667
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Salone has the healthcare conference,

668
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,840
the African business student conference,

669
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,559
they have the um the sports um the

670
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,080
sports conference. Uh um and there's

671
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,080
there's just a number of conferences

672
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,000
that you can that you can attend and a

673
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,200
lot of alumni have either supported

674
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,559
those conferences or go to those

675
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,799
conferences. Those are other ways to

676
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,799
kind of make those connections with the

677
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,799
alumni.

678
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,400
I think one other simple thing is just

679
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,640
to to be really flexible.

680
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,320
Excuse me. Um is to be really flexible

681
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,000
on your timing. And now we have the

682
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,640
option. People are really used to, you

683
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,480
know, a phone call, a Zoom, um offer to

684
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,000
get them coffee at the office, you know,

685
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,960
meet them somewhere that's convenient

686
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,559
for them. Um, I think, you know, people

687
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,400
are always happy to talk about

688
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,159
themselves and their journey as long as

689
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,760
you have really specific questions and

690
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,559
asks as to like what you're trying to

691
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,159
dig into. Um, so, so keeping that in

692
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,760
mind and and being as flexible as you

693
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,640
can on that to be respectful of their

694
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,640
time is also really helpful.

695
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,240
>> Yeah, I have nothing more to add to

696
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,480
that. I think that was pretty spot on

697
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,880
overall.

698
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,720
Awesome.

699
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,440
So now I'll leave the remaining time for

700
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,720
our open Q&A. There are almost a dozen

701
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,960
plus questions in here. So I want to

702
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
make sure that we get to most if not all

703
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,000
of the questions here. So I'll start off

704
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,919
one. This is one looks like it's

705
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,159
targeted towards Greg. So for

706
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,559
international students planning to build

707
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,640
ventures or return to emerging markets,

708
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,000
how does the alumni networks continue to

709
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,760
play a role postgraduation?

710
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,799
Yeah, I mean I think one thing I want to

711
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,919
emphasize, so we are based here at MIT

712
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,600
Sloan and we have MIT Sloan alumni clubs

713
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,400
regionally in some of our major markets

714
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,000
like New York, San Francisco, but once

715
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,640
you graduate, you're also part of the

716
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,880
wider MIT and institutewide network of

717
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,559
alumni. So we have 31,000 Sloan out in

718
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,720
the world, 141,000 MIT alumni all over

719
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,960
the world. And so you have access to

720
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,200
those networks and internationally where

721
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,799
we don't have too many MIT Sloan

722
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,840
specific clubs we have almost 100 MIT

723
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,440
institutewide clubs and often Sloan are

724
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,679
the ones who are rising to leadership

725
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,480
position of those volunteer networks. So

726
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,600
I think you know definitely tapping into

727
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,360
the alumni clubs across MIT wherever you

728
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,799
are in the world. We like to say

729
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,799
wherever you are in the world there's an

730
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,480
MIT network there for you. So that's

731
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,880
what I would add.

732
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,320
Thank you for sharing, Greg. Marissa,

733
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,320
>> I was just gonna Can I just build on I

734
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,080
just want to like give give Craig's team

735
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,120
credit where credit's due. like my class

736
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,360
graduated in um 2021 in the midst of the

737
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,279
pandemic and we had a lot of really

738
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,440
creative ideas for how we could get

739
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,200
together and you know now that you know

740
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,279
after the pandemic when it was okay and

741
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
safe to get together again and every

742
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,600
time we had an idea we had at least two

743
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,279
or three folks from OEER like happy to

744
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,039
hop on a call with us figure out if

745
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,120
there was resources if there were people

746
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,600
available and you know it was really

747
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,520
driven by by our students and completely

748
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,440
supported by the school and it just was

749
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,279
really nice to have that network ability

750
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,360
to kind of if you can dream it we'll

751
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,200
help build it kind of a scenario and

752
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,960
that included virtual things that you

753
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
know we involved students from clubs all

754
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
over the country but it also included

755
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,720
having events in New York having events

756
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,279
in London you know it was it was just a

757
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,720
lot of um it was a lot of support for

758
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,399
for the creative thinking that the

759
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,679
alumni came up with and I think it was

760
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,080
nice to know that that happened even

761
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,120
after graduation.

762
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
>> Awesome. Thank you for sharing that

763
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,679
perspective Marissa. I know sometimes

764
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,679
students are often curious about how

765
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,200
that that that co year went and how

766
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,960
students were able to engage within the

767
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,720
community. Um and happy to see that

768
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,480
you're still engaging postgraduation as

769
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
well. I'll stay with you for this next

770
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,440
question because it does have to do with

771
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,640
healthcare and I know you did I want to

772
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,559
say complete the healthcare certificate

773
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,240
while you're at Sloan. So for students

774
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,159
that who know what they want to do

775
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,919
postNBA and want to use Sloan as a

776
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,760
testing ground particularly in

777
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,520
healthcare. What are some intentional

778
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,200
ways you've seen them design their

779
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,960
experience beyond traditional coursework

780
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,640
and student activities? So that could be

781
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,000
more personal, but if you have any

782
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,440
classmates you want to highlight and

783
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,640
what they did to kind of build their

784
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,559
their classwork.

785
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,919
>> Yeah, absolutely. I think this is a

786
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,480
great opportunity to highlight our

787
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,720
action learning approach at Sloan um

788
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,039
where many of our classes have kind of a

789
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,120
a projectbased component where you're

790
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,039
working either with specific cases, with

791
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
companies, with other alumni. There's a

792
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,880
lot of different ways to do it and some

793
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,320
of those classes are healthcare focused.

794
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,919
You know, the healthcare certificate has

795
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,480
a healthcare action learning class,

796
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,720
healthcare lab, but many of the other

797
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,039
lab classes have healthcare type

798
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,960
projects. And so that one that was like

799
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,399
actually really formative for me was

800
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,159
every time I looked at, you know, a

801
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,000
global lab or, you know, an

802
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,760
entrepreneurship lab or some other type

803
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,279
of lab, I was like, well, this is

804
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,039
Boston. There are a lot of companies

805
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,320
that are doing life sciences that are

806
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,799
doing these things. So what are the

807
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,440
individual projects within those kind of

808
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,200
courses that I can tailor to to my

809
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
interests and to my level? Is it working

810
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,039
with you know thermoffisher on an

811
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,039
operations to deliver their some of

812
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,679
their products to their life sciences

813
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,320
companies? Is it um helping kind of the

814
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,320
biotech decisionmaking process and

815
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,880
really understanding what it goes into a

816
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,919
life science venture um activity and and

817
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,360
what those risks assessments are. And so

818
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,200
not just thinking like what are the

819
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,679
healthcare focused classes but what is

820
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,120
the content that can be applied and um

821
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,559
maybe I can speak to one specific

822
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,799
project. One of my favorite classes I

823
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,520
took in my second year was the

824
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,200
innovation ecosystems class and I wasn't

825
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,200
particularly interested in starting my

826
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,399
own venture or forming kind of an

827
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,200
entrepreneurship type um resume but that

828
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,640
class was taught by um some faculty that

829
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,000
they were they were really focusing on

830
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,720
how do you build a system around

831
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,600
innovation and we had the opportunity to

832
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,200
kind of dig into a certain case and so I

833
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,880
took you know I told the professors that

834
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,559
I had one specific case it was a final

835
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,919
group project and I didn't care if

836
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,600
anyone else was going to be in my group.

837
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,519
I really wanted to do this case and my

838
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,799
case study was vaccine development for

839
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,120
COVID. Um I was really interested in how

840
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,519
you know um Biontech this tiny company

841
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,200
out of Germany came up with a solution

842
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,039
and then but had to you know partner

843
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,200
with Fizer because they didn't have the

844
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,440
innovative um ability there in Germany

845
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,760
and within their company and similarly

846
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,840
Merna was in the US and they were able

847
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,200
to fund raise and triple their size and

848
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,720
work with the US government and do

849
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,000
everything in house and those were two

850
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,919
completely different models for

851
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,080
innovation and so I was applying the

852
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,679
class concepts and I ended up convincing

853
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,600
one other student to join my project

854
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,919
because she was, you know, just excited

855
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,679
that I was excited. But the faculty were

856
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,519
okay being flexible. You know, typically

857
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,720
it's a four or five person project, but

858
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,080
I talked to them at the beginning and

859
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,840
was like, look, this is something I'm

860
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,760
really interested in, and I know that

861
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,600
there's a group component here, but is

862
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,799
it okay if I really like run with this?

863
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,240
And and they were totally comfortable

864
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,159
with that as long as we had that

865
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,240
conversation to tailor the class to to

866
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,200
my interests and the research I wanted

867
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,720
to do.

868
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,399
>> Thank you for sharing, Lawrence. I'll

869
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,320
pass it over to you for this next

870
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,240
question. It has to do with specifically

871
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,679
the Sloan Fellows program, but also your

872
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,279
your venture that you were able to

873
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,519
launch. So, looking back at your

874
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,600
transition after the 2024 Stone Fellows

875
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,320
program, what specific resources from

876
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,559
the career development office or alumni

877
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,039
um prove most pivotal in landing your

878
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,039
next venture/shop?

879
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,080
>> Yeah. Um I think there was a couple of

880
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,399
so the co office um career development

881
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,880
office provided one of the things that

882
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,840
they did is for the stone fellows and I

883
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,600
think they do it for the two-year

884
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,000
programs is they offer these set of

885
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,720
courses on on interacting with um either

886
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,240
alumni or people within the industry and

887
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,159
how to set up like I mentioned earlier

888
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,840
informational interviews but just how to

889
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,919
better interact with individuals so that

890
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,760
you are getting the best responses when

891
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,200
you need to reach out to to people

892
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,840
within the space that you want to get

893
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,200
into after after business school and um

894
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,559
so there's there's the course that they

895
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,840
that they offered and a couple of

896
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,320
classes that they offered that you can

897
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,919
take um and then there's like the actual

898
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,600
working with a a um an adviser in the co

899
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,000
office that introduced me to alumni that

900
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,960
had launched either launched their own

901
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,760
venture fund or were in the venture fund

902
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,559
uh were working for other venture um um

903
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,720
venture funds in the Boston area. And

904
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,640
those in introductions really help to

905
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,080
shape kind of like my thinking and my

906
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,399
approach in in possibly launching the in

907
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,800
in in launching the venture fund. So

908
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,520
they do it in in in many different ways.

909
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,200
um thinking about a specifically how to

910
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
interact with people that will help you

911
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,560
understand how to launch the fund and

912
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,520
then be connecting you with the right

913
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,000
individuals one-on-one meaning the the

914
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,760
co office individual will send an email

915
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
introduce me and then I will connect

916
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,079
with them connect with the the alumni

917
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,520
through through that way. So yeah they

918
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,679
they really played a major role in kind

919
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,280
of just shaping my understanding of of

920
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,280
who to who's best to interact with and

921
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,240
then also developing my my investment

922
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,000
thesis for the fund.

923
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,679
Thank you for sharing. The ne the next

924
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,240
question I have is open to the entire

925
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,480
panel. So um from your experience, what

926
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,480
are some of the unwritten norms around

927
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,200
engaging with Sloan alumni that new

928
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,200
students often miss?

929
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,839
>> Oh, can I I have something?

930
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,920
>> Yeah, go ahead.

931
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,520
>> Um so essentially so the first day of

932
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,200
Sloan, one of the one of the things that

933
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
you learn very quickly is that everyone

934
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,720
is super accomplished and everyone has

935
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,000
done something. Um, and everyone is

936
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,839
pretty humble about the things that

937
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,800
they've done. Um, and I think you don't

938
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:19,760
necessarily need to um, sell yourself

939
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,920
um, in regards to who you are to have a

940
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,480
conversation with somebody from Sloan. I

941
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,079
think people from Sloan value the the

942
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,599
opportunity to just either learn from

943
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,520
somebody or to share something that

944
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,359
helps someone else. So I would highly

945
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,960
always recommend that you know as you

946
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,440
interact with alumni or Sloan or or or

947
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,359
alumni or Sloan, you don't need to sell

948
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,720
your who you are to them. They're

949
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,720
they're open to having these

950
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,720
conversations.

951
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,200
I would add I mean we're often talking

952
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,599
to students as they're approaching

953
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,599
graduation and so you know they're often

954
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,520
in career and job mindset and I

955
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,359
mentioned this earlier but um you know

956
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,440
getting out of the transactional mode

957
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,119
just remember when you join the MIT

958
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,280
Sloan community this is a community for

959
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,839
a lifetime and so it's not just about

960
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,839
getting a job like truly emphasize like

961
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,520
trying to build relationships with the

962
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,599
other people who have come before you in

963
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,000
this community as well. So just keeping

964
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,560
that again, it's a lifelong community

965
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,480
here.

966
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,440
>> Yeah. I think one one really important

967
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,680
way to do that is to to make sure to to

968
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,839
continue your alumni or community

969
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,400
engagement goals regardless of where you

970
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,079
are in your job search. Um just kind of

971
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,599
remember consistently like what what do

972
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,119
you want from a network? What do you

973
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,160
want to you know what level of

974
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,520
engagement do you want with the

975
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,760
community? not just when you need

976
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,320
something, but when you know for for the

977
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,560
long term and and thinking about how how

978
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,040
that means showing what that means for

979
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,520
you and how showing up looks like um you

980
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,640
know on a day-to-day basis sometimes it

981
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,400
can be really hard to to

982
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,839
show up and for an event or some

983
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,880
activity because and you're thinking,

984
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,560
well, what am I going to get out of

985
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,119
this? But I feel like you're always

986
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,960
happy to to do it in the end. And so

987
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,760
just giving yourself some grace to to do

988
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,599
that.

989
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,520
Yeah, I think doubling down on that, I

990
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,599
think the actual community aspect, not

991
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,359
treating treat uh treating everything as

992
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,839
like a transactional relationship like

993
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,599
hey, I'm g reach out to this person XYZ,

994
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,520
but I want to develop a relationship. I

995
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,400
think relationships are the big thing

996
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,320
around alumni, community, and

997
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
networking. Um, and not just like, hey,

998
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,480
what can I get out of this? Um, finding

999
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,599
ways to like understand that person,

1000
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,520
what they're going through like their

1001
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,160
career journey is really important.

1002
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,839
Awesome.

1003
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,960
Thank you all for sharing. Uh I know

1004
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,160
we're getting close to time, but I want

1005
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,920
to kind of save time for a few more

1006
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,160
questions if possible. Um so this is

1007
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,400
open to everyone. So um how does the

1008
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,240
Sloan Alumni Network retain alumni

1009
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,920
engagement and that stay relevant to

1010
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,400
alumni's needs as they progress through

1011
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,400
their career journey?

1012
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,119
Think that may be a specific question

1013
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,839
for you, Greg. I'm not sure, but anybody

1014
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,359
can feel free to answer. Yeah, I mean

1015
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,960
there are the nitty-gritty technical

1016
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,119
things. We send surveys. We get

1017
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,119
feedback. We constantly are meeting with

1018
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,680
alumni on the road and working with our

1019
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,520
volunteers to hear feedback from alumni

1020
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,000
on the programming they would like to

1021
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,160
see. Um whether that's career or faculty

1022
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,079
engagement or intellectual programming.

1023
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,599
Um and then down to how do we change

1024
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,760
some of our traditions like what do we

1025
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,680
do at reunions? Bringing C functions in,

1026
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,920
you know, all of those different ways um

1027
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,000
that we can, you know, keep alumni

1028
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,880
connected. So those are just some

1029
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,880
thoughts off the bat.

1030
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,200
>> And the next question I have will be for

1031
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,280
those that are looking to pivot careers.

1032
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,440
So you know what is the most effective

1033
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,359
way to reach out to alumni working in

1034
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,359
the a sector that they're interested in?

1035
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,839
I think one effective way is actually

1036
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,400
having a reach out on LinkedIn, having a

1037
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,000
really clear and concise message. Um,

1038
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,240
I've seen some messages where there

1039
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,520
essays, hey, I'm a I have a lot going on

1040
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,000
in my personal life, in my uh job life,

1041
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,400
career. um and seeing like something

1042
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,560
four or five like paragraphs like oh man

1043
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,520
this is like entire I think just keeping

1044
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,160
like short simple friendly ask um is one

1045
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,000
a great way um just for like the sake of

1046
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,000
time and u simplicity
