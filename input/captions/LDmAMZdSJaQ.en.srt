00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,120
BTO, representative of Moon Vision

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
Company.

3
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,719
Vamos.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,840
Uh, hello everyone. My name is Tankto.

5
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm the CEO and co-founder of M Vision.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
In this presentation, I will primarily

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,559
focus on heat leaching and mineral

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,399
processing. We all know, we all heard

9
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,000
the world needs a lot more copper and

10
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,559
other metals than is currently

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,559
producing. But most of it if not all of

12
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,600
it is expected to be coming from

13
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,160
lowgrade or heat bleaching is ideally

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,960
suited for processing lowgrade or as it

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,879
is less energy and water intensive than

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,439
conventional mineral processing on a per

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
ton of produced metal basis. Today

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,360
leeching is already a hundred billion

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,320
dollar industry producing more than 20%

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,479
of worldwide copper. As many of you know

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,640
very well, the leeching process is

22
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,119
deceptively simple because after all in

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,119
leeching the or is mined sometimes it is

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,439
crushed and then stacked onto huge

25
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,560
piles. These are then irrigated from

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,960
above with a solution that ideally uh

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
will permeate through the whole stack

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
wetting it uniformly dissolving the

29
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,079
metal contained in the mineral grains in

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
the or itself. However, there are many

31
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,520
reasons why this actually does not

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
happen in practice and the fluid does

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
not distribute uniformly across a full

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,799
scale heap. And this creates a classic

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,200
Goldilocks problem. Too little fluid

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,600
content is the leading cause for poor

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,600
recovery. But too much poses the risk of

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
mass massive potentially catastrophic

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,799
landslides. And the two often are

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
related, meaning that if some portion of

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,479
the leeching heap is too dry and

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,560
unproductive, it is likely that some

43
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,719
other portion is too wet and potentially

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,720
dangerous. But how do you go about

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,560
solving this problem? Not only the pile

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,120
is thick and opaque, which doesn't allow

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,959
you to see inside, it's also huge, which

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,879
means that any sampling campaign is

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,200
going to be costly, slow, and by

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,680
definition incomplete. Well, today we

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,400
think we can thanks to a special kind of

52
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,120
natural occurring X-ray,

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
which

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,720
>> in the last few decades, scientists have

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,239
finally been able to look inside ancient

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,800
pyramids and volcanoes. Muon Vision is

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,519
now using that same technology to

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,840
revolutionize mining. The breakthrough

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,800
behind this revolution, muon

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,920
radiographic imaging, also known as

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
murography. Muons are subatomic

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,400
particles naturally formed when

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,720
radiation from distant supernova

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,000
explosions collide with the Earth's

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,319
atmosphere. Muons constantly penetrate

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
every square meter on the surface of the

67
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,879
Earth. At Muon Vision, we've developed a

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,360
subterranean technology capable of

69
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,000
detecting and recording muons as they

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
travel deep underground. We then use

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,599
that data to create 3D density maps of

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,800
large above ground structures like

73
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,280
tailings dams and leech piles. In a

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,560
mineral leech pile, for example, Muon

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,200
Vision's technology can identify dry low

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,440
density areas where leeching fluid isn't

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,519
reaching. When operators can see this

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,159
issue, they have the chance to adjust

79
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,080
their processing and prevent billions of

80
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,040
dollars in assets from being left

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,519
behind. In tailings dams, the same

82
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,920
technology can precisely determine the

83
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,640
static stresses on the material as well

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,959
as friatic levels, thus validating the

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,920
dam design and helping increase its

86
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,560
performance. When you see deeper, you

87
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,360
can work smarter. Muon detection

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,840
empowers you to look inside mining's

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,280
largest structures and optimize for

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:10,040
efficiency, profitability and safety.

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,040
See deeper with Neuon vision.

92
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,799
So what we offer is a service is a

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,359
radiographic imaging service that for

94
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,000
the first time allows operators to scan

95
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,800
map quantify critical fluid content as

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,199
well as uh air concentration in sichu in

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,280
near real time with very high precision

98
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
and continuously while operating

99
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,960
entirely remotely together. This has

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,600
never been done before. We think that

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,479
this represents a disruptive step change

102
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,479
and allows us to build that digital twin

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,960
that will finally identify, locate and

104
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,639
quantify the remedial actions that we

105
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,400
need to take place in order to maximize

106
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,800
the productivity and the safety of the

107
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,960
asset. In other words, instead of

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
proceeding blindly, which forces you to

109
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,880
process the material in just a single

110
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,440
pass even it is known that the material

111
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,440
is not homogeneous, with this service,

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,680
we can unlock additional value. This

113
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,240
includes maximizing yields from ongoing

114
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,720
operations, identifying secondary

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,120
leeching opportunities, reducing or

116
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,120
optimizing the consumptions of water and

117
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,120
exceivate

118
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,160
risks, costs and delays associated with

119
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,320
human interventions or routine sampling

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,919
were warranted. But senator three also

121
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
reducing and better managing the risk

122
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,479
for REI failure which as you can see

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,479
here can be a truly catastrophic event

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,720
for the asset the company and the

125
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,039
community all the way to potentially

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,520
extending the life of assets to defer

127
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,520
closure cost or to better time or

128
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,560
removal in highly mechanized operations

129
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,800
like on and off leeching. So here is an

130
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
example of what our service actually

131
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,120
sees. This was a small leeching

132
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
operations outside of La Ligua. The

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,280
customers you can see here started

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
irrigation and slowly the fluid start

135
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,039
partially filling the pore space in the

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
material. The density of the material

137
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,120
should therefore increase increase and

138
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
for the first 100 hours that is exactly

139
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,440
what we see. Higher density in the heat

140
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,039
means more attenuation and therefore

141
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,440
less muons and that's what we are

142
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,840
showing. But we also see the right

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,240
amount of densification.

144
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,880
The observed 3% drop that you see on the

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800
muon flux is actually equivalent to a 5%

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,039
density increase in the heap material

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
itself which under reasonable

148
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,840
assumptions corresponds to having added

149
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,919
20% of fluid into the pore space which

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,880
is the operating point for a leeching

151
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,400
heap like this of a gomerated or but

152
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,600
this is not the end of the story

153
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
although the customer would have

154
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,919
expected that from here on the density

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,919
of the hippo staying constant it doesn't

156
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,680
in fact as the operation progresses now

157
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
we see that the number of muons is going

158
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
back up and the heap is getting lighter

159
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,600
even though the irrigation rate has not

160
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
changed. What could be happening here?

161
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,600
The most probable conclusion is that the

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,360
heap is actually losing its fluid likely

163
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,520
because of a preferential channeling

164
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
effect. And as you can see the

165
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,520
difference between

166
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
where you would like to be and where you

167
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
actually are is actually significant.

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
And no wonder this heat may actually be

169
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,360
producing a lot less at the end of the

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
cycle. This is not something you could

171
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,639
tell just by looking at the fluid coming

172
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,479
out of the leeching heap itself. and

173
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,400
he's an example of a problem that you

174
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,160
cannot diagnose reliably without

175
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,400
munioraphic imaging.

176
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
A little bit about our story and our

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,639
path. We started a few years ago in

178
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,160
Chile actually and while still small, we

179
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,479
have been steadily growing. We are now

180
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,639
capable of offering our patented

181
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,360
solutions and services across a range of

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,880
tool sizes and uh operate while

183
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
operating off the grid. We are

184
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,479
remotizing actually the last aspect of

185
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
our scanning service that is the

186
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,800
movement of the sensor themselves at

187
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,639
which point we will be able to fully run

188
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,880
in the background of mining operations

189
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,560
with minimal interference. At the same

190
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,639
time we are building advanced control

191
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,479
panel and visualization interfaces where

192
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,880
you can access your data seamlessly in

193
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,599
the cloud. And yes of course we built

194
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,720
and test our detectors in Chile. Today

195
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,960
we can also leverage our brand new uh

196
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
underground facility for murography

197
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,039
located about 40 minutes outside of

198
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,280
Santiago. Here we can show to cast

199
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,120
interested parties how our service works

200
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,199
but also we can validate it against

201
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,680
known density standards under control

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,440
conditions. This one-of-a-kind facility

203
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,599
was designed with a goal of uniquely

204
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,280
improving our readiness and decreasing

205
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,840
the risk around the adoption of our

206
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,440
technology. We have put together a

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
startup team which is a mix of young

208
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,759
talent, experienced professionals and

209
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,840
industry leader with more than 100 year

210
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,080
100 years of industry experience. As you

211
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,080
can see, most of the team is actually

212
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,000
here in Providentialia Santiago and we

213
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
actually importing scientists to Chile

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
like Adrian who was up to a few months

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,120
ago a postto at MIT.

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,880
Before I conclude, I would like to

217
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
clearly state that what MU vision does

218
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,000
and is capable of doing is not only

219
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,160
leeching. After all, m radiography is a

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
general purpose non-destructive uh

221
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,080
platform for non-destructive evaluation.

222
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,640
And indeed, we have identified multiple

223
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,040
opportunities across the mining value

224
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,360
chain from exploration to mining plans

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
and of course critical slope stability.

226
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
What we offer today is a digit

227
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,760
digitalization service which I hope you

228
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,680
can appreciate as being unique. Tomorrow

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,519
however, our ambition is to offer much

230
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,480
more and we hope to walk some of that

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,160
path together. Finally, as preparing

232
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
this presentation, I was also asked to

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,000
justify why why Chile. Well, that's

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,760
actually the easy part. We can say for

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
as you heard, you know, as we know,

236
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,839
Chile copper production and reserves are

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,399
more relevant than Saudi Arabia to oil

238
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
and gas to make an example. But we also

239
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,760
find that Chile is a very friendly

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,839
environment and most importantly to us,

241
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,680
we can access excellent human excellent

242
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
human resources and we mean it. You saw

243
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,440
that in the previous slide. We are

244
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,519
committed to hiring Chileenos and keep

245
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
growing in this country. There are also

246
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
technical reasons for doing coming to

247
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,720
Chile after all is the country of one

248
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
and a half leeching heaps which is one

249
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,200
of the most promising use cases of our

250
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,000
technology and also finally Chile has

251
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
very high elevation mines and for us uh

252
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,720
that is actually a a gift because the

253
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
best location for any midography

254
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
application is at higher elevation as

255
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,959
possible which means more muons and

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
therefore faster measurements.

257
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,959
What are we asking? Our mission is

258
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,680
really to help you do more and better,

259
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,399
but we still sit outside of the fence

260
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,399
and we don't really see what you see. So

261
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,800
what we're really asking is a continued

262
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,440
engagement so we can together define and

263
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,600
quantify the best opportunities ahead.

264
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
The old model of producing more just by

265
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,760
digging more. We think it's changing and

266
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,920
today mining is industry has a clear

267
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,920
desire to innovate. Our X-ray powers,

268
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,920
unique X-ray powers are ready to

269
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,000
transform it with your help and deliver

270
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,450
a step change to this critical essential

271
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,700
industry. Thank you very much.

272
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,700
[Applause]
