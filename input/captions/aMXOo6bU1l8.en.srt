join us for other sessions. We have a

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,400
very robust schedule um throughout the

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,400

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
on the extensive career services that

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,680
they provide to our EMIN students. So

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,479

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,320
some of these virtual sessions, uh, I

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,799
would encourage you to keep an eye out

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,560
on our website. We will post recordings.

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,360
We do have a YouTube channel where you

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,520
can find them as well. And then we also

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,360
have a great schedule of some in-person

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,200
events. Um, and again, we will be around

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,960
the globe. this month. In fact, I'm

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,799
going to highlight that we have

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
admissions representatives talking about

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,360
the MIN program as well as other

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,560
programs who will be in Asia as well as

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,640
Europe, the UK. So, definitely um check

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
out our events web page and learn more

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,439
about ways that you can further engage

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,840
with us. Uh so, just a couple of quick

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,680
housekeeping details. Um I'm also joined

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,080
by my awesome colleague at admissions,

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
Rachel. She and I are going to be behind

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,800
the scenes answering your questions.

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,720
please put them in the Q&A. Um we will

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
attempt to answer as many questions as

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,440
possible um throughout the time that um

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,599
is presenting. Um but we'll also leave

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,000
some questions um to be answered live at

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,520
the end of the slide presentation and

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
hopefully these are questions that will

64
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,319
be of interest to the general prospect

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,000
population. So again um we really

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
appreciate your patience as we get

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
things started and I am going to now

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,840
kick it off to my

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,800
>> Thank you Diane. Thank you so much. And

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,519
I I can uh first of all, welcome. This

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,840
is so exciting. I know I can't see you,

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
but I can see the number of participants

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
going up. It's almost like a stock

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,400
ticker. And uh we're very close to a

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,720
number that's a magical number for us,

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,360
which is the number of students we admit

77
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,159
every year. So hopefully it's going to

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,640
be you. Uh so welcome. Um

79
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,040
today our goal is to focus on the

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,519
curriculum which is probably one of the

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,239
most important reasons why you will be

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
thinking about MFIN. And now for all of

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,680
you you're at a stage where you're

84
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,080
probably in you know in your senior or

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
junior year in undergrad or you're

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
working and you've been you know been in

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,599
the market for a few years and you're

88
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,720
thinking about coming back to some of

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,799
the fundamentals about the program. um

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,640
or you're just curious do you you know

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,599
you're exploring an MBA we're thinking

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,400
about an MIN um so you're at the right

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,200
place to learn more about our curriculum

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,120
today obviously uh a master of finance

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,760
program is um is is an uh is a pathway

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,080
to your career success and as Diane

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,959
mentioned you know we just had a session

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,000
on careers specifically but we do know

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,840
that in the world of Master of Finance

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,080
there are several programs that one can

101
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,159
consider consider and we believe that we

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,040
have a very unique curriculum and I'm so

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,879
excited to share that with you. So let's

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,479
start with uh something that I'm really

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,359
passionate about. I I have been in MIT

106
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,919
um for almost 14 years now. I I was in

107
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,040
the industry before that and what truly

108
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,440
keeps me excited about the opportunities

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,280
of working at MIT is is truly this

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,880
mission that guides the work we do. We,

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,199
you know, all the four of us here who

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,160
are, uh, on the call today, uh, are

113
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,680
excited and invested in, um, you know,

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,280
shaping future leaders, yourselves, um,

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,440
in a way that is grounded in ethics, in

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,240
principled innovation, in advanced

117
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,639
thinking, and that's exciting to me and

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,000
our curriculum reflects that aspect of

119
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,280
it. So, Master of Finance is part of a

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
portfolio of programs that the MIT Sloan

121
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,520
uh school offers. And this is a actually

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,960
a really unique aspect of being in an

123
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,680
MIT class that your classmates are not

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,320
just folks who are from your own program

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,120
and in your age and stage group, but

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,440
from across uh different experience

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,280
levels, parts of the world. and it

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,400
really makes for a very dynamic

129
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,639
classroom experience which truly impacts

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,080
your learning education learning

131
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,240
opportunities here. So let's dive in

132
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,280
specifically to the Master of Finance

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,400
program. It is an 18month program that

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,960
starts in the summer uh and it has a

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,880
fall term, a spring term, a summer

136
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,600
internship and another fall term. So

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,680
that is typically the program. a handful

138
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
of folks go into the 12-month program

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
and we can talk a little bit about what

140
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,639
that is. Essentially, the degree

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,560
requirements are exactly the same. It's

142
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,759
just a much more compressed period of

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,639
time and it's well suited for students

144
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,880
who either have a job or are sponsored

145
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
or are very focused on what they're

146
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,759
trying to get out of their master of

147
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,840
finance. What I love about our

148
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,479
curriculum is that it it has a very

149
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,800
strong core that stands the test of

150
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,520
time. you know it was built by professor

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,919
Merton and professor low and you know um

152
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,160
stalwarts in the field who understand

153
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,919
that in order to have a master's degree

154
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,240
in finance there are some fundamental

155
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,560
principles and things about the markets

156
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,560
and tools you need to know but the

157
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,479
markets will keep evolving and um what

158
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,680
you need to know to be successful in

159
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,840
those markets um will be something that

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
we will teach through the electives. So

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,360
the beauty of our program is it's a

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,240
strong core that is not flexible but the

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,479
electives are and the pathways you can

164
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,280
create out of the program are

165
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:04,080
customizable tailored to your career

166
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,880
interests and that is extremely unique.

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,360
The most fundamental difference about an

168
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,400
MIT education is I would say this whole

169
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,599
notion of applying what you're learning.

170
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,360
It's it's um part of our ethos. It's

171
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,680
part of our um moto mens and manos which

172
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,039
means the mind and hand. And so action

173
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,400
learning or applicationbased

174
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,800
um coursework is something that is very

175
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,840
essential and is a required part of the

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,039
MIN experience. We also have some

177
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,039
interesting optional concentrations. uh

178
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,039
you can think of it as some kind of a

179
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,360
major maybe uh where you can drill down

180
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,080
on certain areas of finance that you

181
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,479
want to uh develop more specialized

182
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,960
skills and knowledge in. Um it's also

183
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,759
good to as a signaling tool for your

184
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,720
career purpose. Um and so we have five

185
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,360
of those. capital markets, corporate

186
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,520
finance, um social impact and climate

187
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,360
finance, financial engineering and a new

188
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,280
one that we introduced on fintech. So

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,440
that's kind of the summary at a high

190
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,759
level on the curricular side. That's

191
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,280
what we are focusing on today. Now

192
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,879
I can jump into um some of these I can

193
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,000
go through each and every single

194
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,680
concentration but I won't do that. So uh

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,160
you know I talked about the fintech

196
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,479
being a new concentration

197
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,839
um and uh you know so every

198
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,599
concentration is comprises of some

199
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,320
finance courses that you would like to

200
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,719
take or you would be required to take

201
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,959
and then a bunch of electives that are

202
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,800
not just finance but gives you much more

203
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,360
interdisciplinary way of thinking. So um

204
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,440
fintech for example there is a course

205
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,600
that we want all students to take which

206
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,120
is on consumer finance and fintech but

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,560
then you have these different

208
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,200
opportunities um to take courses from

209
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,680
VCs from financial engineering you can

210
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
go more advanced um you know analytics

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,560
and machine learning u new enterprises

212
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
is a fantastic course taught by our

213
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,640
Martin trust center for entrepreneurship

214
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,680
you typically will find a lot of MBAs

215
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,279
taking this course um fintech venture is

216
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,959
product design. Again, in product

217
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,120
design, you will actually see these are

218
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,279
mostly digital products that people look

219
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,600
uh working on, but you will also see

220
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,560
people from other uh degree programs

221
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,519
like you know um product uh from um sort

222
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,080
of undergrad from uh PhD students as

223
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,720
well. So it's very exciting to to be in

224
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,200
this sort of interdisciplinary space

225
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,600
where you are focusing on something you

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
are developing advanced skill sets but

227
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,120
you're also getting to take classes from

228
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,839
across Sloan courses as well as a

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,480
courses across MIT. So let's look at

230
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,560
another one. Um financial engineering

231
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,880
you know we have a very significant

232
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,680
number sometimes half the class is uh

233
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,320
looking at financial engineering

234
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,959
and uh we've got a very robust selection

235
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,360
of courses. This is uh starting with

236
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,959
your core right. I mean even in the core

237
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,440
we teach two um we have two coursework.

238
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,120
One in finance financial mathematics and

239
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,760
the other one in financial um analytics

240
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,440
and uh you're there are two versions of

241
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
that. There is a regular version and an

242
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,000
advanced version. If you are someone who

243
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,160
wants to pursue financial engineering,

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,480
maybe you're thinking about hedge funds,

245
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,320
quadrant trading, prop shops, you know,

246
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,440
as your future careers or even asset

247
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,600
management, investment management. Um I

248
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
often see our students uh venture into

249
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,279
the financial engineering world. Uh so

250
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,000
you would be taking these kind of

251
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,279
courses and then again there are um you

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
know as you see there are very advanced

253
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,560
finance electives for you to choose from

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,640
and then um you can take courses beyond

255
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,120
that. The machine learning and AI

256
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,240
courses listed over here. Some of them

257
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,360
are taught within uh by our finance

258
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,200
faculty. Some are taught at Sloan level

259
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
and then there are some that are you are

260
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
taking courses at computer science and

261
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,920
electrical engineering or at physics or

262
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,800
math and some uh you know a glimpse of

263
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,000
those courses are listed over here. So

264
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,480
it's really exciting uh opportunity for

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,920
you to develop capabilities um not only

266
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,640
through core and fundamental courses but

267
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,120
newer applicationbased courses

268
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,040
projectbased courses and then sitting in

269
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,320
classrooms where you're working with

270
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,320
MBAs and PhDs and then uh you know

271
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,839
undergrads and graduate students from

272
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,240
across the campus very vibrant

273
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,240
so um I'm not going to go through every

274
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
single concentration because you you

275
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
know there's there's climate a there's

276
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,959
climate action work that u our students

277
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,680
do there is you know corporate finance

278
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,160
uh but what I wanted to highlight about

279
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,600
students who uh you know are interested

280
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,519
in climate and sustainable finance is

281
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,519
again not only are they taking these

282
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,680
finance courses but they get the

283
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,560
opportunity to work with energy

284
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,000
initiatives at MIT um that particular

285
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,720
course or with the energy market

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,639
dynamics in a decarbonizing economy. I

287
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,160
think most likely this is a course that

288
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,160
is uh offered uh from one of the

289
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,959
engineering side of the campus. So it's

290
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,040
exa it's exciting that you can be in

291
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,240
this environment where you're learning

292
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,880
finance, you're learning tools, you're

293
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,680
learning how to think about business

294
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,440
problems, organizational problems and

295
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,839
then go as deep and quant as you want on

296
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,760
certain topics. Uh so that's just

297
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,240
fascinating.

298
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,440
So I thought what I'll do um because I

299
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,639
definitely want to go uh into questions

300
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,040
that you may have. Um but before we jump

301
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,600
into all the questions um let me give

302
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,160
you some an actual taste of what

303
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,760
students have done in the past because

304
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,560
that helps to understand and relate to

305
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,120
this whole gamut of coursework. Um

306
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,279
incidentally I mean I uh you know we we

307
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,920
did a study once to look at how many

308
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,920
possible electives or variety of

309
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,839
electives have our students taken and

310
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,639
it's um

311
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,880
from across 800 electives and and again

312
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,399
I I'll caveat that by saying there's not

313
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,399
800 electives in finance absolutely not

314
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,000
um but you know you're at MIT so if you

315
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,519
you know want to take a class in fluid

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,320
dynamics u you can do that so you know

317
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,480
And that's not going to be the whole um

318
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,079
listing of your coursework, but if

319
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,440
you're curious about something and if

320
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,680
you just want to take a couple of

321
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
courses outside of sort of the finance

322
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,200
and related fields, you're absolutely

323
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,680
welcome to do that. So, let's dive in

324
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,399
and see. Uh so, this is let me think uh

325
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,800
let's go back to that. Yeah. So, this

326
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,320
particular student I'm trying to

327
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,800
remember. Okay. So this student um you

328
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,560
know is as comes from an engineering

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,959
background and uh his goal was if I

330
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,959
remember him correctly his goal was and

331
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,120
he is um working in a quant research um

332
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,560
capacity in an asset management company

333
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,800
right now. and he had he had a very

334
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,800
solid engineering background and he

335
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,199
wanted to kind of maximize as much

336
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,000
finance as he can uh do um in his two

337
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,839
years over here. In fact, if I remember

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,199
some of our conversations, he said, you

339
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
know, he was actually working in the

340
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,399
industry for a couple of years and his

341
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,519
goal for coming back to doing a master

342
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,079
of finance was actually to strengthen

343
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,920
his knowledge in finance fundamentals

344
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,000
and core and knowledge of markets

345
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,839
because he said I felt that if I really

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,800
want to commit to a career in this

347
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,639
field, I want to I want to strengthen my

348
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,279
understanding uh of finance. So

349
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,440
the courses you see listed over here are

350
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,839
not core courses. Core courses everyone

351
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,600
has to take. So here are some additional

352
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,160
courses that he took, some electives

353
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,399
that he took. Uh one the first one that

354
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,399
he took in the first fall it's uh about

355
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,320
understanding financial statements and

356
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
the other one is about making uh

357
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
decisions

358
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,519
and you know he's right now in an asset

359
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,920
management company. So obviously there's

360
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,720
a lot of kind of that strategic thinking

361
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,519
when you're using quant research into

362
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,760
asset allocation. Uh and then he did

363
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,639
finance lab. He did a phenomenal finance

364
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,040
lab project. He took uh the advanced

365
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,560
finance uh courses. He obviously took

366
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,480
asset management. You know any uh

367
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,320
investor is obviously going to learn a

368
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,880
little bit about crypto and blockchain.

369
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,000
And so he took the crypto course some

370
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,320
derivatives not surprisingly being a

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,959
good investor you you want to learn

372
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,279
about uh global economics and the

373
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,240
implications of that. So that's how he

374
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,680
kind of designed his coursework and an

375
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,160
interesting course that he took you'll

376
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
see corporations at crossroads. This is

377
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,759
something he took in his second fall

378
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,399
when he came back from his internship

379
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,759
and he said you know um this is a course

380
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,920
where uh senior leaders some seale

381
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,639
executives a lot of CEOs uh uh come to

382
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,480
the class and it's a close class

383
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,360
actually taught by our senior leadership

384
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:32,720
at MIT and uh the these these executives

385
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,160
discuss with students what difficulties

386
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,199
what what um real challenges they faced

387
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
at certain junctions of their career and

388
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,120
how they thought through that

389
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,040
decision-making. So again, this is a

390
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,360
really well-rounded

391
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,360
uh portfolio of courses where a student

392
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,079
with an engineering background, very

393
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,320
strong quants is pursuing a quantrol

394
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:59,360
right now really wanted to um strengthen

395
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,600
his understanding of finance and global

396
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,839
economics. Let's look at another co

397
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,360
another student.

398
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,199
Um this is a student who uh had a

399
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,919
certain amount of quant background but

400
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,559
not as much as the previous person we

401
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,640
were talking about. And so one of the

402
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,120
things you will notice is uh that this

403
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
student um they took a little bit more

404
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,799
coursework in

405
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:30,160
fun like economics uh decision-m

406
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:34,000
um programming uh if I remember this

407
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,080
person correctly um this person had a

408
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
very strong background in economics and

409
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,480
statistics but hadn't done enough

410
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,440
programming. So they actually took one

411
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,559
of the uh intro courses that computer

412
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,320
science department offers to sort of um

413
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,799
strengthen that aspect of um their um

414
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,760
programming skill sets. And again you'll

415
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:00,000
see the student also took a course of

416
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:04,640
leading in ambiguity. So what's exciting

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,360
is that our students absolutely focus on

418
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,400
the fundamentals. they develop some

419
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:14,640
extremely strong quantitative uh skill

420
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,000
sets. Um but they also don't do that in

421
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,320
the absence of the context in which

422
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,600
they're going to be uh you know working

423
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,240
in. So all of them we train our students

424
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,919
to think about not just your first job,

425
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,440
not just that you know I'm going to make

426
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,520
this crazy model and um just geek out on

427
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,039
it. Of course you can do that. But the

428
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,000
idea is how can you actually become a

429
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,080
finance leader in the future and you

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,440
know start thinking about some of the

431
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,480
more macro aspects uh of running an

432
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,640
organization while also studying the

433
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,200
depth of quantitative finance.

434
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,200
Do we have another example Rachel? Uh

435
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,840
probably not. So maybe at this point um

436
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,400
Katie, would you like to tell the

437
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,280
students about sort of the arc of how

438
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,840
this experience goes? I know that you

439
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,760
advise hundreds of MFN students and

440
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,280
you're probably more suited to talk a

441
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,720
little bit about that arc of that

442
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,559
experience. Yes, thank you so much. So

443
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,640
um as you will notice here, first and

444
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,400
foremost, we have a summer start. This

445
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
is really what sets the EMIN program

446
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,760
apart and sets our students up for

447
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,679
success by getting ahead of the game uh

448
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,240
in the summer term. This is an

449
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,960
accelerated abbreviated summer term that

450
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,919
takes place during July through August.

451
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,120
Uh that sets the foundation for your

452
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,760
learning at Sloan and more largely at

453
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,120
MIT. During the summer term, you will be

454
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,360
enrolled in um four courses which are

455
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,520
part of your mandatory core in the

456
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,480
program. And these courses will lay the

457
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,400
groundwork for more advanced studies and

458
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
those that you can tailor later on in

459
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,520
the program. After the summer term in

460
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,760
the fall, you will continue some of your

461
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,000
core studies with financial markets,

462
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,480
corporate finance, ethics, which is a

463
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,720
half-term course, and analytics. Here

464
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,120
you have the options for advanced or

465
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,960
regular analytics. Also during this

466
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,640
time, some students begin their action

467
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,080
learning uh requirement with a

468
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,320
proseminar or take electives. Following

469
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,240
that, this is when students really start

470
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,240
to dive in and curate their studies to

471
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,679
their specific career. They do this

472
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,000
through the type of action learning

473
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
requirements that they enroll in and the

474
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,400
projects that they're ultimately

475
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,320
assigned to as well as their restricted

476
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,880
electives and the more large electives

477
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,000
that they take at Sloan across MIT or

478
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,080
even crossregister for at Harvard.

479
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,480
This allows students to pursue a

480
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,799
concentration if they like, enroll in a

481
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,720
certificate program, or just deepen

482
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,120
their studies in an area that might be

483
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,960
suited for them in terms of their

484
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,720
recruiting for an internship or a

485
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,679
full-time position. So, uh, our unique

486
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,679
period um during January is part of AP,

487
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,640
which is independent activities period.

488
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,600
This is when, uh, our very popular

489
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,440
finance lab runs. Um, and then it goes

490
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,320
into the spring term, which runs from

491
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,960
February through May. After May,

492
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,400
students in our 18-month program, uh,

493
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,360
pursue their internships, and then

494
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,200
return in the fall for their final term.

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,440
At this time, this is when students in

496
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,280
the 18-month program would complete a

497
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,679
communications requirement, which is

498
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,240
really tailored to finance careers and

499
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,559
communicating the data and the

500
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,200
day-to-day work that you are doing. um

501
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,120
as well as finishing up their elective

502
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,919
studies and any additional

503
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,840
concentration, certificate or other

504
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,400
opportunities such as a thesis

505
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,080
independent study they may be pursuing.

506
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,320
Um students in the 18-month program

507
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,480
finish their studies in December and are

508
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,080
conferred in February and welcome back

509
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,600
to celebrate in um May or June of the

510
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,400
following year.

511
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,960
>> Thank you, Kitty. Thank you so much. And

512
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,840
all of this amazing experiences is

513
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,120
taught by our world-class faculty uh

514
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,799
comprising Nobel laureates, global

515
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,200
experts, practitioners in the field. um

516
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,200
you know the one of one of the new

517
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,880
courses in AI research in applications

518
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,280
AI and um research and um finance has

519
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,919
been launched by Hu Chen and Dennet

520
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,000
Kogan who's our faculty director as you

521
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,000
can see and again just fantastic courses

522
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,840
uh you know there were several questions

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,880
around how we stay on top of uh the

524
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,000
trends and how we evolve our curriculum

525
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
it's one of my favorite questions

526
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,799
questions uh to get because I love to

527
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,720
boast about how our courses keep

528
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,679
changing every year. You know, we have

529
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,760
this course list uh that um you know,

530
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,039
you're going to see on our on our

531
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,840
website and while the co core remains uh

532
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,559
sort of more or less the same in terms

533
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,679
of the coursework, the content changes,

534
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,600
but new courses are constantly added. Um

535
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,720
we've had you know four new courses in

536
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,640
AI and um this year that have been added

537
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
in sort of the intersections of AI and

538
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,000
finance in different ways and you know

539
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
one of them is being taught it's called

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
AI and money and it's being taught by

541
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,400
professor Gary Gensler who was the

542
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,240
former um chair of the SEC and his the

543
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,600
way he's thinking about the course is

544
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,240
how the presence of AI uh and its

545
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,400
influence on financial markets uh

546
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,640
requires you to develop more critical

547
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,840
thinking capabilities. On the other

548
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,840
hand, Professor Kogan and Professor Chen

549
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,919
has introduced an AI and machine

550
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,080
learning research course in um in in

551
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,240
finance where you're literally learning

552
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,080
how to model various types of uh you

553
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,320
know financial phenomenon and risks

554
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,640
using AI. So for example, there's a

555
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
course uh there's a you know team that

556
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,799
is looking at political risk and

557
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,600
volatility. There is a and sorry

558
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,080
political risk and firm valuation. there

559
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,600
is a team that is looking at uh trading

560
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,200
volume and uh volatility alpha you you

561
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:23,919
know so from very quant um applications

562
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,000
of AI to critical thinking uh using AI

563
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,960
uh it's just so exciting that our

564
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,039
coursework keeps changing and as you

565
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,400
know the fundamental aspect as I was

566
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:37,200
talking about is is um action learning

567
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,080
it's you know you have these amazing

568
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,559
courses that allow allow the students to

569
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,279
take the classroom learning in across

570
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,279
public and private markets into real

571
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,120
world projects um that you can do

572
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,080
throughout the year. So that's just so

573
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,080
phenomenal. So with that um Diane, is it

574
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,080
back to you and then we can pick up some

575
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,080
questions.

576
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,159
Yes, it is busy answering some of those

577
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
questions. That's great. Thank you all

578
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,880
for all these great questions that are

579
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,520
coming in. um we are working very hard

580
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,159
to get to all of them. Um but I know

581
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,880
that um for many of you hopefully this

582
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,520
has inspired you even further in hearing

583
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,440
about the amazing courses and and

584
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,640
learnings that you'll be able to get our

585
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,679
faculty all the the you know academic

586
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,159
resources that are also provided to our

587
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,520
students both one-on-one as well as

588
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,320
collectively. There are many

589
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,480
opportunities for you to really sit down

590
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,799
and say have you know these are this is

591
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,640
my plan these are the skills or the gaps

592
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,799
where I really think for me to be able

593
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,720
to launch a career in finance is going

594
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,679
to make sense um and to have those

595
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,240
conversations you know with Hermy's team

596
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,400
um is really an an important part an

597
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,559
aspect of what we offer in addition to

598
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,120
of course our um career services and

599
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,559
those adviserss. So, in terms of the

600
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,480
application, I'm just going to quickly

601
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,720
go over this because, uh, this is all

602
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,039
available online. The application is

603
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,600
live. Um, first and foremost, let me

604
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,400
just say that, um, you can apply to

605
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,240
multiple programs at MIT. Uh, there's

606
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
absolutely no negative inference if you

607
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,400
choose to do so. Um, the other thing I

608
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
will mention is we do not have rolling

609
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,120
admissions. So, as you can see, the

610
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,200
deadline to apply is the 5th of January

611
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,159
2026. And that's for anyone who's

612
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,000
planning or intends to enroll in July of

613
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,559
2026. Um, we as a policy in terms of a

614
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,679
standard, you should only be applying if

615
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,679
you intend to enroll next year. That's

616
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,919
something that um is really important to

617
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,000
think about. If you're not ready, that's

618
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,840
fine. then you may want to wait um until

619
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,240
a time such that you feel more

620
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,799
comfortable and ready to to take on the

621
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Master of Finance program. Um it goes by

622
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,880
so quickly. Um and as you can see from

623
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,480
everything that you've heard from Ermy

624
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,320
and Katie, it is um really chock full of

625
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,320
lots of information and skills that

626
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,480
you're going to need to get through. So

627
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,000
in terms of the application components,

628
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,520
and these are not listed in any

629
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
particular order other than just

630
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,440
alphabetically. So every component of

631
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
our application is important. Um it's a

632
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,640
little bit of a cliche but our our

633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,559
admissions process is very holistic. We

634
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,120
are looking at everything. And I will

635
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,440
also say that upfront if you look at our

636
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,080
class profile which is available online

637
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,720
and and perhaps Rachel um will be able

638
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,960
to put the link in that um in the chat

639
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,120
in the Q&A for you to be able to see it.

640
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,360
Um they come from multiple disciplines

641
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,159
and backgrounds. uh to quote one of our

642
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,799
faculty, uh you don't necessarily need

643
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,279
to come with a lot of finance coursework

644
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,120
um as an undergrad um or in if you've

645
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,279
already earned a master's degree or

646
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,760
advanced degree. We can teach you

647
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,520
finance. What we're really seeking are

648
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,520
individuals who have the academic

649
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,559
strength, the problem solving and

650
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,640
analytical skills, um who have a passion

651
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,360
and understanding of what it might be

652
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,279
like to pursue the field of finance. um

653
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,840
this isn't a pre-professional or early

654
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,320
career program. Many of our students are

655
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,000
coming directly from um university. So

656
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,679
you'll see all that information is

657
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,760
available on our website. These are all

658
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,200
the application components. So obviously

659
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,520
we're going to be looking at academic

660
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,320
transcripts, looking at what courses you

661
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,000
take and are some of those courses um

662
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,480
more, you know, substantive and

663
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,760
quantitative in nature. uh it you know

664
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,480
it could be from many different

665
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,480
disciplines engineering physics um other

666
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,240
sciences or other coursework that you've

667
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,200
done econometrics

668
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,159
uh we are you know offering if you'd

669
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,200
like to submit the GMAT or GRE they are

670
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,960
acceptable uh but they are optional so

671
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,120
it's really your decision and your call

672
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,440
if you believe that that uh providing

673
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,440
those test scores are really going to um

674
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,120
help to us on the admissions committee

675
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,039
to get a better sense of your academic

676
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,039
strength and then we are looking for

677
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,960
three letters of recommendation. Um,

678
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,480
this is all detailed out in the

679
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
application itself. We're looking for

680
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,200
two academic and one professional,

681
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,279
meaning, you know, presumably you've had

682
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,679
some internship experience, so a more

683
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,640
recent internship. We're also looking

684
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,120
for relevant coursework on, you know,

685
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,240
the MIN program is a deep dive into

686
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,760
quantitative finance. a lot of the

687
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,240
essential foundations in work such as

688
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,320
you know mathematics and we again we ask

689
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,039
about this in the application whether

690
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,520
that be calculus statistics probability

691
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,240
these are all really ways to help you to

692
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,399
be able to thrive in the program um

693
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,880
given all the financial modeling and the

694
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,880
stochastic processes and vector analyses

695
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,159
and all the different um aspects of the

696
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
program that you're going to be working

697
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,320
on. So, we are looking at some specific

698
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,760
coursework. Uh, you may be uh able to do

699
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
some of that online if you haven't been

700
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,360
able to do that as part of your um

701
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,279
undergraduate or graduate studies and

702
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,240
that's perfectly acceptable. And then if

703
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,559
you have any professional

704
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,440
certifications, um we're happy to see

705
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,120
those as well. A resume, very specific

706
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,000
um instructions on what that should look

707
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,720
like and how to um put that in place. Uh

708
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
as well as some short answer questions.

709
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,120
You'll see all of that. Um, some of them

710
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,039
are just, you know, a little bit more

711
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,440
about you. And then we have a couple of

712
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,159
video questions. Um, I would say, you

713
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,159
know, one is a way for you to introduce

714
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,000
yourself to your future classmates and

715
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,120
for them to get to know who you are a

716
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,880
little bit better as well as the

717
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,120
admissions committee. And then there'll

718
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
be one um question that's a purely

719
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,640
randomized

720
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,760
uh what I would call general interest

721
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,799
non-technical question um that will be

722
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,480
um a timed one. Uh but again this is all

723
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,279
part of as I said all of these

724
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,679
components uh are really important and

725
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,760
part of helping us to understand who you

726
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,720
are why you're applying to the Master of

727
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,240
Finance program uh and hopefully to

728
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,039
demonstrate that you'll be able to

729
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,039
thrive at MIT.

730
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,840
Okay. So how are we doing on questions?

731
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,679
I'm going to actually stop. This is the

732
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,200
general um email um that you can send

733
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,279
certainly send questions. I believe we

734
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,840
also have a specific one for MIN which

735
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,679
is on our website. Um and maybe Rachel

736
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,840
if you can just put that one in the um

737
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,080
chat or Q&A because I know there's a

738
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,000
specific MIF admissions email that you

739
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,080
can send to us. And then again, if you

740
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,399
want to scan this QR code to join us at

741
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,640
an upcoming event, both virtual or in

742
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,640
person, um please go ahead and do that.

743
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,799
All of this information around

744
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,200
admissions is all available on our

745
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,919
website and in the application. So I am

746
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,760
going to stop sharing my slides and um

747
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,919
lean to into our um other folks here

748
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,640
Rachel Katie others. Are there any

749
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,919
questions in particular that we want to

750
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,799
answer live um for that be of interest

751
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,799
in terms of the curriculum?

752
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,799
Let's see.

753
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,320
Okay.

754
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,159
>> Hi Diane. Yes, I'm happy to share from

755
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,080
both the questions that came up today as

756
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,480
well as questions that were submitted

757
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,480
prior to the session. Uh there were

758
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,559
several questions around concentrations

759
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,640
if you must do one. Um and if you can

760
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,720
pursue more than one. So I just want to

761
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,279
clarify that concentrations are

762
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,679
optional. Yes, more than half of our

763
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,200
students do end up pursuing at least one

764
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,200
concentration

765
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,120
um specifically because these are to

766
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,880
help you position yourself within the

767
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,679
job market and show how you've tailored

768
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,080
your studies um specifically to your

769
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,519
desired career path. However, they are

770
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,320
not mandatory and yes, you can choose

771
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,840
more than one. Uh I think in recent

772
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,240
years, we've had some students do as

773
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,240
many as three concentrations. All this

774
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,320
requires is your flexibility and

775
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,720
dedication and working closely with your

776
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,720
program advisor.

777
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,919
Okay, great. Um, someone is asking about

778
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,360
venture. He's interested or she is

779
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,600
interested in venture capital

780
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,799
postgraduation. Any suggestions on

781
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,000
concentration in the program um for

782
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,559
following that career path?

783
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,120
>> Yeah. Um so you know before I answer

784
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,519
that question I I I want to just uh you

785
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,679
know piggyback on what uh Katie just

786
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,240
mentioned. The concentrations and the

787
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,000
design of the program in general the MIN

788
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,320
program the design of the program in

789
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,360
general is to help you support your

790
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,159
pathway uh and as as long as it's

791
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,440
related to finance and related spaces.

792
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,399
Uh so we are not dis you know we have

793
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,799
done a study about our our curriculum

794
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,760
looked at other curriculums and what's

795
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,120
very exciting and unique is that we have

796
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,000
a whole span of coursework and our

797
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,000
students going in a whole array of

798
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,840
careers um that span from the highly

799
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,640
quantitative rigorous mathematical work

800
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,279
to the behavioral finance and economics

801
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,000
and sort of um you know the consumer

802
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,760
aspects of finance as well. So it's it's

803
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,840
uh we have students who go into

804
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,560
investment banking and private equity

805
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,679
and venture capital. We've got folks who

806
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,320
go into traditional um you know

807
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,000
financial fields like asset management,

808
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,240
investment management, those who go into

809
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,480
prop shops, quant trading, quant

810
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,879
research. Um we also have people who are

811
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,679
looking into fintech opportunities from

812
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,200
being in product design to actually

813
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,960
fintech in you know ventures um real

814
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,159
estate. We have a couple of folks who go

815
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,240
into real estate as well. So really it's

816
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,440
when you think about why should I come

817
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,520
to MIT think of do you have a passion

818
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,960
and an interest in finance that you want

819
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:53,040
to explore? Do you want to strengthen

820
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,760
your qu skills while also expanding your

821
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,560
uh world view? Do you want to strengthen

822
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,079
your network? Do you want to be a part

823
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,160
of an institute like MIT where you know

824
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,720
not just take courses within a business

825
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,440
school but within an engineering school

826
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,960
and a and a science school. So it's it's

827
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,000
that holistic way of thinking is what

828
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,240
makes it so exciting and our adviserss

829
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,440
like Katie and others will help you sort

830
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,680
of cater and design a pathway that makes

831
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,599
you successful. So your question, one of

832
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,400
the questions was on um you know venture

833
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,640
capital. Absolutely. We've had uh I will

834
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,480
say that VC um as a field is hired to is

835
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,520
is tougher to break into straight out of

836
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,440
an Min because they don't hire a lot of

837
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,880
people in general. Um but you can start

838
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,240
your um journey here. We have fantastic

839
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,560
courses uh that are specifically VC

840
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,040
focused actually but also in general the

841
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,119
fintech concentration uh is a phenomenal

842
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,440
concentration to be part of because you

843
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,320
also build your cohort of likeminded

844
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,760
peers um and then you can be part of the

845
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,640
VC club at MIT Sloan and and take other

846
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,960
coursework at our Martin Trust Center

847
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,400
which helps you not only develop the

848
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,440
understanding of finance but

849
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,680
understanding of early stage ventures uh

850
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,160
and how to kind of help them scale, how

851
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,560
to help them um build their momentum.

852
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,000
And so it's it's really an exciting

853
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,480
field to be in. We do have a couple

854
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,800
people going into VCs every year,

855
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,839
>> right?

856
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,680
>> What else Diane?

857
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,440
>> So we have another question about in

858
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,000
addition to the core modules for the

859
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,240
18-month program, how many electives can

860
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,640
you take? I know this is always a what

861
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,800
what's the the course load that anyone

862
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,440
can really take? Um and from different

863
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,720
concentrations even. So as I mean I'm

864
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,560
going to punt this question to Katie but

865
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,599
I will just say this everything is

866
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,960
dependent on your goal your career goal

867
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,520
your academic learning goal and how you

868
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,119
want to and how much other stuff is

869
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,200
going on in your life. Are you someone

870
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,880
who has a job already and therefore you

871
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,280
know uh you have uh more time to take

872
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,680
even more rigorous coursework. you know

873
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,680
it's really a balance of many things and

874
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,680
at what point of time you know sometimes

875
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,839
we have people taking less coursework in

876
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,320
their first fall besides the core

877
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,240
courses uh and then you see the second

878
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,320
fall they're taking a lot of courses in

879
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,240
spring but Katie any specific sort of

880
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,839
average you see when you're when you're

881
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,839
advising your students

882
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,480
>> yeah I would say you know the summer is

883
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,320
lock set for you so um that's really the

884
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,240
only term that uh we enroll you and you

885
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,520
have a set number of courses after that

886
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,160
it's totally up to you, your goals, and

887
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,839
um your ability. So, I would say on

888
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,320
average in the first fall term, we see

889
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,400
students take four to five classes uh

890
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,720
and then they only increase from there

891
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,240
typically. Uh, of course, for students

892
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,520
in the 12-month program, that's much

893
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,480
higher. In terms of the degree

894
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,240
requirements, so you have restricted

895
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,560
electives. We ask you to take at least

896
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,400
four of these. If you are pursuing a

897
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,200
concentration, you will likely take more

898
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,440
than four, usually around six. Um,

899
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,359
however, beyond that, you are able to

900
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,119
enroll in any Sloan courses, uh, MIT

901
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,320
courses. So, it's very common to see

902
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,480
students, as my mentioned, taking higher

903
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,440
level economics, finance, computer

904
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,280
science courses, um, as well as

905
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,440
crossregistering. Many students choose

906
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,160
to in future terms, be it spring or

907
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,240
second fall, crossregister at Harvard.

908
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,800
um they often do so for leadership

909
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,720
courses, maybe some niche negotiation

910
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,960
courses to supplement their finance

911
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,000
studies as they think towards long-term

912
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,079
management roles as they progress. Um I

913
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,040
think one of the many benefits of the

914
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,800
program is this ability to understand

915
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,640
what your recruiting cycle looks like,

916
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,040
supplement that with classes that really

917
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,760
matter in real time. So, what do you

918
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,079
need at this point in time in recruiting

919
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,560
and what will you need for your future

920
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,040
internship or job and tailor your

921
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,960
schedule to that?

922
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,560
>> Thank you, Kitty. Um um you know, you

923
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,760
mentioned the negotiation class, which I

924
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,880
think is really important for me to

925
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,079
mention. Um we have every year a good

926
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,240
handful of students going into

927
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,440
investment banking and for those

928
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,680
students you know they are taking

929
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,640
obviously corporate finance advanced

930
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,440
corporate finance they're taking um you

931
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,359
know valuation courses but they're also

932
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,400
encouraged and many of them take courses

933
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:30,560
in negotiations in law in organizational

934
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,720
management um in decision- making. So,

935
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,119
you know, these are all very, you know,

936
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,560
interesting ways of thinking about

937
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,480
expanding your skill set, not just in

938
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,839
from a quantitative perspective, but a

939
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,880
holistic perspective, an

940
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,560
interdicciplinary perspective. Um, and

941
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,720
while I'm on the topic of investment

942
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,040
banking, I I you know, you're going to

943
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,200
hear me say this many, many times, but

944
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,920
if you are interested in pursuing an

945
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,960
investment banking internship, you must

946
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:03,040
be looking into those opportunities by,

947
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,200
you know, early um in during winter. Uh,

948
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,000
so January, February are often the

949
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,400
deadlines. And so this is this catches

950
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,240
our students surprise. It's basically

951
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,520
even before we've given decisions about

952
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,400
EMIN. So just please track that on your

953
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,200
own. That is extremely important. We

954
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,400
don't control the market. Diet.

955
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,160
>> Yeah. Um no great. So we did have I know

956
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,760
I think are we running short on time

957
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,280
here? So I want to make sure there's a

958
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,040
lot of questions about the application.

959
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,520
Can I just um say to all of you um we

960
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,920
have many um info sessions that are

961
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,599
already um posted recordings of them

962
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,280
about that are more specific to the

963
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,280
application and admissions process.

964
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,599
encourage you to take a look at those.

965
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,680
We will have an application tips webinar

966
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,000
coming up in another month and a half.

967
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,720
Um so definitely stay tuned for more

968
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,720
information. The application really is a

969
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,119
great resource. Um we have a lot of

970
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,800
details and instructions and it's very

971
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,880
you know for the most part should be

972
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,000
pretty clear about what we're looking

973
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,920
for um and what's required. So please

974
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,520
just read through those. But we are here

975
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,359
to help. Please email that Empress.

976
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,280
If we don't get to some of your

977
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,440
application questions today, I want to

978
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,160
take the time that we have with me and

979
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,040
Katie to really focus on um more of the

980
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,640
the core of the curriculum itself. So I

981
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,800
think maybe as a closing question uh

982
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,760
there is one about what are the common

983
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,079
traits you see among the most successful

984
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,400
students in the program.

985
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,640
Um, thank you for asking that and and

986
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,720
I'm sure Diane will say more in future

987
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,400
sessions, but but honestly curiosity.

988
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,240
Um, you if you are coming to MIT,

989
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,839
uh, we're looking for someone who's

990
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,040
really curious to expand their

991
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,920
worldview, expand the way they think,

992
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,079
uh, to somebody who's who's excited to

993
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,000
participate in a community and build a

994
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:05,040
network. Um, if your only goal is to get

995
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,880
a job, I wouldn't say this is the right

996
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,079
place for you. You will get a job.

997
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,359
That's not the point. But that's a very

998
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:17,280
narrow way of thinking about the MIN

999
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:21,359
experience. The Master of Finance at MIT

1000
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,480
is is a very holistic experience and you

1001
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:27,440
can go as deep as you want academically

1002
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,839
and build incredible proficiencies in

1003
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,000
tools, markets, knowledge that you

1004
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:36,800
didn't have before, but you're going to

1005
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,160
make the best use of it if you want to

1006
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,480
build a network. If you want to uh if

1007
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,119
you're curious, if you want to hear

1008
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,119
about talks uh that are happening in

1009
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,319
different parts of the campus that

1010
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,800
really expand the way you think um

1011
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,839
because the what we see is the people

1012
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,319
who make a difference in the market uh

1013
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,359
after graduating from our program are

1014
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,640
the people who are able to be original

1015
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:08,079
thinkers, problem solvers with the tools

1016
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,760
of finance but they go beyond uh the

1017
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,520
call of duty and that's what we are

1018
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,319
trying to look for as we look at your um

1019
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,880
you know as we look at your uh

1020
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,640
applications. Um I know that was

1021
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,680
supposed to be the last question but

1022
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,160
there I did see a lot of uh questions

1023
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,040
around in the past around sort of give

1024
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,440
us some examples of some you know action

1025
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,920
learning work that we do or applied work

1026
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,920
we do. So I'll just give one example or

1027
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,079
two example just to help you understand

1028
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:43,040
how expansive your uh you know worldview

1029
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,319
can become you know uh fin example or

1030
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,160
the research course um they allow

1031
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,640
students to work both in private and

1032
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,240
public markets you know one AI based

1033
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,880
application that our students are

1034
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,560
working on is to identify how political

1035
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,640
risk influences firm valuation you know

1036
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,319
that's one work they're doing it's a

1037
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,000
research paper that you're working with

1038
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,599
three or four faculty members. There's a

1039
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,920
team working on that. There's another

1040
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,960
team that is looking at the inclusion of

1041
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,079
gold, crypto, um commodities, real

1042
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,119
estate in um and how that is enhancing

1043
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,480
asset allocation. Um you know, uh

1044
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,160
they're trying to hedge against

1045
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,400
inflation. They're trying to reduce

1046
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,240
portfolio volatility. They're looking at

1047
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,960
long-term growth. So, that's a very

1048
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,400
different type of uh an application that

1049
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,520
folks are looking at. There's another

1050
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,839
team that is um that worked on um

1051
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,160
long-term you know sustainable housing.

1052
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,640
So uh and then of course there's a whole

1053
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,520
bunch of folks who are working on pitch

1054
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:45,280
decks, valuation models. So it's really

1055
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,800
a very exciting vibrant place where you

1056
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,520
learn

1057
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,680
with amazing like-minded peers but then

1058
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,200
you go into a world where you have so

1059
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,960
many people from different backgrounds,

1060
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,640
different parts of the world taking

1061
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,040
classes with you. Uh you you have very

1062
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,000
foundational courses, very advanced

1063
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,520
courses, critical thinking courses,

1064
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,520
teamwork,

1065
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,520
um

1066
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,319
a place that is passionate about problem

1067
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,400
solving and about making the world a

1068
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,800
better place. That's what's MIT about.

1069
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,880
And so you have to be excited about that

1070
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,079
vision and and come here for that

1071
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,480
purpose.

1072
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,440
>> Great, great advice. Thank you, Army.

1073
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,760
Thank you, Katie. Um, really great to

that students will learn as part of

1076
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,839
being in the infant program. So, again,

1077
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,200
