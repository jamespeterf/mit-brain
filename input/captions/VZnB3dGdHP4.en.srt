1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,160
Okay. So,

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,000
right let me just so let me just quickly

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,279
review some what we have done so far in

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,359
the class. So we talked about first we

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,359
talked about R as a ordered set

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,920
and field.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,360
Then we have talked about sequences and

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,360
limits.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,200
Uh and then we talked about series

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,000
and then finally we have talked about

11
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,559
and this is where we will continue

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,559
today. we talked about metric spaces

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,680
and so the

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,560
the idea here is that uh we want to

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,159
there's a lot of things that from the

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,799
from R that actually generalize

17
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,799
uh and make sense um and some of those

18
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,320
are sequences and limits so they

19
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,720
generalize from R to metric spaces there

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,119
other things that don't generalize like

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,920
it's not a order a general metric space

22
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,960
is not a it doesn't necessarily come

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,000
with a ordering and it's not like a

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:49,119
field uh and uh in particular you can't

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,600
typically you can't sum elements so a

26
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,920
series doesn't make sense either right

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,960
but but these things here make sense in

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,479
a metric space

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,799
and so let me just remind you what is a

30
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,759
metric space.

31
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,759
So a metric space

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:18,080
uh is uh a set. So x is a set

33
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:25,120
and then there is a distance function.

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:29,680
So this is a map from x cross x into r.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:34,400
And for each two pair of elements

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:38,480
uh uh x and y in x

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,480
you have that let me make it a capital

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,640
like x like this for every two elements

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,680
in in this set the distance between them

40
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:55,120
should be positive

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,200
and it should be non- negative and uh n

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
equal to

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,000
to zero. The distance between two points

44
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,200
should be zero if and only if

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,959
this points are the same. Right? And

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,800
then it should be symmetric. So two

47
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,280
property two is that it should be

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,120
metric. So it doesn't matter whether you

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,080
go from x to y or from y to x the

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,080
distance is the same.

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,400
then and the third which is like the

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,920
most non-trivial part is the triangle

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,920
inequality. So this here is symmetric.

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,959
And the third property is that if you're

55
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,280
looking at X, Y, and C, so you have

56
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,080
three points

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,200
and you go from

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,920
from X to C,

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:04:00,239
then it's certainly not further than if

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,040
you first go to from X to Y and then go

61
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,760
from Y to C. Right? So this should be

62
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,400
less or equal to the distance from X to

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,080
Y plus the distance from Y to C. And so

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,329
this third property here is is what's

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,199
called the triangle inequality.

66
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:23,560
[Applause]

67
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,560
So this is the triangle inequality.

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,560
Now, so that's that's what a metric

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,360
space is. And again, the the the sort of

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,240
canonical example.

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,759
So the canonical example of a metric

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,000
space is where you're taking x equal to

74
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,160
the real numbers. And then for two real

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,600
numbers, the distance between them is

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,479
just where you're looking at the norm of

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,120
the difference. Right? So this here is a

78
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,160
nice distance, right? It's clearly non-

79
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,800
negative. It's clearly equal to zero if

80
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,199
and only if x is equal to y. It's

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,759
clearly symmetric. And the triangle

82
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,199
inequality is this inequality that we've

83
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,880
used all the time, right?

84
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,080
The same. So this here is um slightly

85
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,800
more fancy version of the same

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:34,000
is where you're looking at uh R2

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:37,840
So the X here is is R2

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,080
or it could even be a general Rn.

89
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,479
And then if you think about two elements

90
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,720
in Rn

91
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:53,680
and you think about say X here as

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:58,000
it's written as X1 comma X2

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,440
up to XN where each of these X's are in

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,400
R and they are in many of them and

95
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,400
likewise for Y

96
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,120
and then the distance here, the natural

97
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,639
distance

98
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,720
is where you're taking

99
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,319
uh this is what's called the ukidian

100
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,720
distance. It's given by pagras. And so

101
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:32,880
it's the square root of the sum of the

102
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:38,479
squares. So x1 - y1^

103
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:42,080
2 + x2 - y2

104
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,919
plus and then all the way up to

105
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,919
xn

106
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,919
- y

107
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,919
squ

108
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,840
and so you see that if n here is equal

109
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,479
to one well then each element is just a

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,440
single element in R and so then this

111
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,599
thing here is really the same as that

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,759
right because it's a square of X - Y

113
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,360
it's a square of this distance and then

114
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
you take the square root so it's the

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
norm

116
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,639
okay so this these here are both of

117
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,080
these is called the ukian usually

118
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,080
referred to as a ukian distance

119
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,199
So

120
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,520
we looked at a few other example

121
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,919
and and I won't look at all of them

122
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:43,720
again but just two more. One is this

123
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,720
with a box distance

124
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,440
and let me state it only in R2 but you

125
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:57,360
could just like this you state it in any

126
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:00,800
RN. So the spaces are two and um and the

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
the distance between two elements. So

128
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
again we write it like this and we think

129
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:12,080
about x as being x1 comma x2 where these

130
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:14,879
are real numbers y = y1 comma y2

131
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,160
and then this distance here is the sum

132
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:26,560
of the of the of these distances these.

133
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:28,400
So this a plus x2 minus y2 like that

134
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,120
right and this is clearly again

135
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,039
symmetric it's clearly non negative it's

136
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,760
clearly equal to zero if and only if x

137
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,080
and y are the same and the triangle

138
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,519
inequality well that just follow quite

139
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,040
easily from the triangle inequality

140
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,600
for this distance okay

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,000
then there is one more example I mean

142
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,000
there's There's other you know uh but

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,160
there's one or more example that is

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,920
often useful to keep in mind and this is

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,800
uh the last one I will review

146
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,640
and so this is the uh the continuous

147
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,680
function. So if you take a interval

148
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,680
a and b are real numbers

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,519
and you're looking at the interval from

150
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
a to b where both end points are

151
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:27,040
included and then you look at the

152
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,080
continuous function on this interval

153
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,720
and then if you have two elements f and

154
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,800
g

155
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,360
so these are continuous each of them are

156
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,360
continuous functions.

157
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:49,200
Then the distance between these two

158
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:56,160
continuous functions is equal to the max

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:58,560
over x and then f ofx minus g of x.

160
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,279
Right? And so x here is in the integral

161
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,240
from a to b.

162
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,440
Right?

163
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,160
And so this thing here so this here was

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,680
on the midterm this particular example

165
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,600
and uh this thing here that the max is

166
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,800
achieved is just like if you're looking

167
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,040
at these two functions then this is the

168
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,839
difference between these two functions.

169
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,640
So this is also continuous and this

170
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,120
means that the maximum at the minimum by

171
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,160
the extreme value theorem is achieved on

172
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,800
an interval of this form. Right? So this

173
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,720
thing here is really achieved

174
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,120
and it's clearly non- negative and it's

175
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,920
easy to see that it has the other

176
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,680
property of a metric space. Okay, so

177
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,560
these are just the examples that we

178
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,519
talked about. Uh and I just wanted to

179
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,160
remind you uh

180
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:59,279
and so then the question is what

181
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,360
generalizes what generalizes from uh R.

182
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,680
So, so right. So, we started with a

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,920
class uh talking about R and uh you know

184
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,000
right so it was order field but but a

185
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,480
lot of the things we talked about for R

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,200
these subsequent things we talked about

187
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,480
sequences and limits

188
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,160
they as we will see make total sense uh

189
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,720
in in a general metric space and has

190
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,640
important consequences

191
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,920
uh including to solve differential

192
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,920
equation equations and or solving all

193
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,000
kind of equations including differential

194
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,240
equations.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,880
Okay. So now

196
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,240
let me

197
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,360
remind you also. So we talked about that

198
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,360
if we have h if this here is a metric

199
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,360
space

200
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,240
then a sequence in a metric space.

201
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:10,880
This is just a map is is a map

202
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:14,560
from the natural numbers into x. So a

203
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,839
sequence is like a map like this.

204
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,720
And so usually the image of the n

205
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,079
element this we will typically denote

206
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,079
again like this xn. So this is what a

207
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,079
sequence is. Uh a subsequence.

208
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,560
This is a this is defined very similar

209
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:43,639
to what we did on the real line. So a

210
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,639
subsequence is the composition

211
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:56,680
of f with

212
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,680
an increasing strictly increasing

213
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,160
map.

214
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:13,120
Uh G from the natural numbers into

215
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,040
in and then the sequence is then

216
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:21,040
uh where you looking where you apply

217
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:24,000
first G and then you apply uh F right so

218
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,240
this gives you when you first apply G

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,560
then it gives you another natural number

220
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,600
and so this thing here the image of this

221
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,320
is then a element in X right so that's a

222
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,200
subsequence and again this will strictly

223
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,680
increasing guarantee you that the

224
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,760
elements appear in the same order.

225
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,920
You're picking a selection of them, but

226
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,680
they appear in the same order as in the

227
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,200
original sequence. Okay.

228
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,279
So, so sequences and subsequences make

229
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,120
sense.

230
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,800
Um, we can then also talk about and I

231
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,560
know we talked about but I just want to

232
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,639
because of the break I just want to

233
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,519
review quickly

234
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,000
uh a few of the things we talked about

235
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,720
right before the break.

236
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,440
So one is that so

237
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,440
uh a convergent

238
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,880
sequence

239
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,000
in a metric space.

240
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,079
So if you take uh if this here is a

241
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,320
matrix space

242
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,320
and xn is a sequence

243
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:49,040
in x

244
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:51,920
xn xd sorry um then um then we say that

245
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:57,160
we say

246
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,160
that xn converge

247
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,240
2x.

248
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,240
If the following hold

249
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,639
that for all for all

250
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
um

251
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:24,839
for all

252
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,839
uh epsilon greater than zero there exist

253
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,680
capital n such that

254
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:40,720
if little n is bigger equal to capital n

255
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:43,279
then uh x n the distance between xn and

256
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,839
this limit

257
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,839
should be less than epsilon right so

258
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,560
that's exact parallel to how we defined

259
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,320
the limit of a sequence or that a

260
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,199
sequence is converging if it was a

261
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,000
sequence in r

262
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,480
and likewise we can define a cruise

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,120
sequence in a metric space. So we define

264
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,120
a C sequence

265
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,120
a C

266
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,959
in a matrix space

267
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,399
XD.

268
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:30,279
So this is a sequence. So that for all

269
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,279
since is a sequence

270
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,920
xn such that

271
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,920
for all

272
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,040
epsilon greater than zero there exist

273
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:55,680
uh capital n such that

274
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,880
if little n m and little n are bigger

275
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,360
equal to capital n. Right? So remember

276
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,680
that a crique sequence mean that the

277
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,039
tail is bunching together. This means

278
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:12,160
that if you're sufficiently far out then

279
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:14,480
these elements xn and xm are epsilon

280
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,439
close together.

281
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,880
So this is what it means for a sequence

282
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:25,039
to be a cy sequence.

283
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,520
And so now we have this theorem and I

284
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,320
think I mentioned it before the break

285
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,400
but let's just quickly run through it.

286
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,240
It's very short.

287
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,640
So uh if you have um so if this is a

288
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,640
metric space

289
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,760
then the theorem is

290
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,799
that any

291
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,799
any uh convergent

292
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,760
sequence

293
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,400
is also

294
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,400
accuracy sequence

295
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,600
and the proof is like this.

296
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,799
So given given epsilon

297
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,679
uh since

298
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,400
since xn

299
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,720
is a convergence sequence so you assume

300
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,640
that xn is a convergence sequence that's

301
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,320
called the limit x. Since xn converts to

302
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,080
to

303
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,320
x, this means that there exist

304
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,320
there exist

305
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:52,000
uh capital n such that if little n is

306
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,880
bigger equal to capital n, then the

307
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,679
distance between little x, little n and

308
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:04,000
uh nx here,

309
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:07,440
this distance here is less than and then

310
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,039
I use epsilon / two.

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,039
And so this means that therefore

312
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,360
if little m and little n are both bigger

313
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,480
than

314
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,640
than capital n then the distance between

315
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,600
the two

316
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,080
distance between this these two elements

317
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,799
here. Well, by the triangle inequality,

318
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,480
we have that this distance is less than

319
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:45,679
if you go over the point x. So if you go

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:48,080
from xn to x and then from x to xm like

321
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,600
that, right?

322
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,640
But each of these because both of these

323
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,840
uh both little n and little little m and

324
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,799
little n are bigger than capital n then

325
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,480
both of these distances are bounded by

326
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,960
epsilon / two. And so you see that this

327
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
thing here is smaller than epsilon.

328
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,799
Right? So this proved that in a metric

329
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,880
space any convergent sequence is also a

330
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:19,360
cush sequence.

331
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:23,280
And we we saw that. So we know that if

332
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,720
we if the metric space is R with the

333
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,120
usual ukian distance

334
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,360
then actually

335
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,799
uh you also and that was the cush

336
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,799
convergence. So the cushy

337
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,919
convergence.

338
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,840
So cushive convergence. It said that in

339
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,240
if

340
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,159
x comma d

341
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,679
is r

342
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:59,039
with the ukian distance. So I denote the

343
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,240
ukian distance like this.

344
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,400
Uh then then we also have then we have

345
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,400
the converse

346
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,240
the converse

347
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:20,840
so i.e uh i.e that any

348
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,840
cushy sequence

349
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,480
this uh is also convergent.

350
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Okay.

351
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,480
Now

352
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:46,159
we looked at a very simple example and

353
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,360
and if I have time I will talk about a a

354
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,520
little bit more interesting example

355
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,919
uh otherwise I'll talk about that next

356
00:21:51,520 --> 00:22:01,120
time. So if uh so so if the metric space

357
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:03,360
was was uh was r with a ukian distance

358
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,400
by then we had a converse but if the

359
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,360
metric space was say so we looked at

360
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,720
where the metric space was so where x

361
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,480
here the set was the interval from 0 to

362
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:21,840
one and the distance here was just the

363
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:27,520
usual ukian distance right so then if

364
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:30,080
you Looking at the sequence xn one / n.

365
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,960
This one here.

366
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,960
This is a sequence in this space. It's a

367
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,520
cusy sequence but it doesn't converge in

368
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,120
this space because zero is not part of

369
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,520
the space. Right? So it so so this here

370
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,520
is a cis.

371
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,799
So this you may say this is rather

372
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,840
trivial

373
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,039
uh example. not very interesting.

374
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,080
Um, I'll show you another example a

375
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:03,679
little bit later or next time uh that is

376
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,480
more interesting but in a in in in some

377
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,400
sense has some of the same feature that

378
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,640
the space is just not quite large

379
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,280
enough. Okay, but it will seem more

380
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,280
interesting. So this here is a CI

381
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,600
sequence that is

382
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,600
not convergent.

383
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Okay.

384
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,799
Right. So, so again you know the cushy

385
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,679
uh bite. Yeah. So this leads to the

386
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,159
following this leads to the following

387
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,159
notion here

388
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,720
that um

389
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,679
that so this is the following

390
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,880
definition.

391
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,880
of being cushy

392
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,880
complete.

393
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:05,320
So a space a metric space x comma d is

394
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,320
cushy complete.

395
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,720
If uh every

396
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,320
cushy sequence

397
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,320
is uh convergent.

398
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,279
Okay.

399
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,360
Okay. So now uh let me define some uh

400
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,440
some so if let me begin with extending

401
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:49,120
some notions from uh from R. So the

402
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,919
first one I want to extend is what it

403
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,919
means in a metric space what what is a

404
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,919
ball.

405
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:08,360
So, so we have here

406
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,360
so a metric or

407
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:18,320
so we have a metric space

408
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,520
we have a point in the metric space we

409
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,240
have some r which is a real number

410
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:30,240
positive real number

411
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:33,120
and then we define uh p r of x Here this

412
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,360
here is the set

413
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:42,159
uh y

414
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:46,159
in x so that the distance from x to y is

415
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,159
less than r strictly less than r.

416
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,159
Okay.

417
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,760
Uh and so this here is called this here

418
00:25:51,760 --> 00:26:00,760
is called the metric ball. This set here

419
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,760
it's called a metric ball or just a ball

420
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,760
uh uh with radius

421
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,640
R and center

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
uh X. Okay.

423
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,880
Now um

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,039
let me just sort of illustrate it. So if

425
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,840
you so a lot of the intuitions about

426
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,440
metric spaces but you have to be careful

427
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:37,120
because sometimes that intuition fools

428
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,679
you just because metric spaces are

429
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,919
allowed to be very general but a lot of

430
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,080
the intuition about metric spaces come

431
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:48,080
from just thinking about things in ukian

432
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,440
space. So now when I'm talking about

433
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,000
ukarian space I'm thinking about mostly

434
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,360
about it could be on the line. So in the

435
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,799
case where x's are or it could be in a

436
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,919
plane where x's are two or it could be

437
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:07,120
where x is three. And so in either of

438
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,360
those three cases the distance is the

439
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,880
distance that you're used to which is

440
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:17,360
the ukidian distance we talked about.

441
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,400
And so you if in that case if you take a

442
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,120
point here so just thinking about

443
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,640
the example where let's think about the

444
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,240
example where x is two

445
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,120
then a ball here well a usual ball is

446
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,720
really just everything that is the

447
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,600
distance r from x right so this is kind

448
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,919
of what I defined over here right

449
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,679
there's another thing you could also

450
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:49,200
look at some other sets. So imagine that

451
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:52,320
you take a line

452
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,480
in the plane

453
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,720
and you could look at or maybe this

454
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,559
could even be

455
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,320
it would look more interesting if I'm

456
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,880
thinking about a line in R3.

457
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,520
So imagine that this is now sort of this

458
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,520
is supposed to look like in our tree and

459
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,320
then you could look at a line and you

460
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,360
could look at instead of looking at a

461
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,520
metric ball you could look at a tupler

462
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,039
neighborhood. So suppose you're looking

463
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,039
that that's very similar to a ball.

464
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,520
So tubular neighborhoods

465
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,840
let's say our tubular neighborhoods this

466
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,080
is where you know you have some positive

467
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,880
number R and you're looking at

468
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,840
everything that is

469
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,360
that has distance at most or let's say

470
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,600
strictly less than R from this line. So

471
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,240
if you do that that would look like a

472
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,320
cylinder where the boundary of the

473
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,880
cylinder is not included because I

474
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,320
require things to have distance strictly

475
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,200
less than R. Right? This is like this

476
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,919
here would be a R2 neighborhood of a

477
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,159
line.

478
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:12,000
So this is just to say that this sort of

479
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,960
notion here of a ball you could even

480
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,600
have something more general and both of

481
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,799
these things right that you know well

482
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,799
from ukian space they make sense in just

483
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,440
a general metric space right you know

484
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,240
line maybe doesn't make sense right

485
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,799
sometime often it does actually but it's

486
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,559
uh but that's something more complicated

487
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,360
but you could just think about it as a

488
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,080
subset and then things that have

489
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,279
distance strictly less than r to that

490
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,919
subset. Okay.

491
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,559
Okay. So,

492
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:51,440
uh right. So, this is what it means for

493
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:56,000
a uh this is what a a ball is metric

494
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:00,159
ball. Then there's a the notion of a

495
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,200
subset of a metric space being bounded.

496
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,200
So, a bounded subset

497
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:13,000
So this is another definition

498
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
bounded

499
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,600
subset

500
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,240
uh of

501
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,240
a metric space.

502
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:36,000
So we have a matrix space here

503
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:39,720
and we have a is a subset

504
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,720
and we say that

505
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,640
a is bounded.

506
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Uh if there exist

507
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:04,399
um if there exist uh x

508
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:10,320
an element in this metric space and d

509
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:13,440
is some d is some positive real number

510
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,559
such that

511
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,159
a here is contained

512
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,960
in the all of radius D

513
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,960
center at X

514
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,480
right

515
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,640
now

516
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,760
with this. So there's a few things like

517
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,440
this that we'll see uh you know for for

518
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,480
these things the empty set right the if

519
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,399
you take X and you take the subset that

520
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,279
has no elements that's the empty set

521
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,840
then it's it's you know the empty set is

522
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,240
is contained in everything right so

523
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,640
actually the empty set would be bounded

524
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,440
okay

525
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,480
um but it's not a particular interesting

526
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,480
example of a bounded Right? And it may

527
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
be that the whole metric space right

528
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,679
it's possible that the whole metric

529
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,720
space is bounded right if it was like a

530
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,679
interval right if it was just a interval

531
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,320
where both in in so first you have some

532
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,440
interval from a to b

533
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,760
then this thing here is uh if you think

534
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,799
about the usual distance on that

535
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,679
interval then that's a boundary set the

536
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,600
whole the whole set x is bounded so in

537
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,480
particular any subset would also be

538
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,360
bound.

539
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,640
Okay. So now uh let me just prove one

540
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,679
theorem uh one little lema that is

541
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,799
another thing that generalizes

542
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,240
from R and that is that if you take a

543
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,919
cushy sequence so any cushy sequence is

544
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,960
bounded.

545
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,960
So let's throw this

546
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,840
So,

547
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,440
so we have again a metric space.

548
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,320
Uh, XN

549
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,320
is a C sequence

550
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,240
and then we think about the set XN,

551
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,640
right?

552
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,679
So this is this subset of X and I claim

553
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,120
that this subset here

554
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,600
this subset here. So A here

555
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,600
uh is bounded.

556
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,679
Okay.

557
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,679
Now why is that the case?

558
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:57,799
So since

559
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,799
Xn is a cruisy sequence

560
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:12,399
if I choose epsilon with so with epsilon

561
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,399
say equal to one you have that there

562
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,399
exist

563
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:26,520
capital n. So that if little n

564
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,520
and s just then

565
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,599
if little n and little m bigger than

566
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,599
capital n then the distance between the

567
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,599
two

568
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,440
smaller than one right this is just

569
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,440
using that is sequence and just pick

570
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:51,679
using one particular epsilon namely uh

571
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,639
taking epsilon to be equal one.

572
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,599
So now of course this means and now you

573
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,760
don't need this event for all of these.

574
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,119
You don't need it like this. You just

575
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,119
need so in particular therefore

576
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,400
uh as long as n is bigger than capital

577
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,520
n. Well you can use one of you can use m

578
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,680
here. You can use capital n for m. So

579
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,240
then this here say therefore for little

580
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,480
end bigger than this we have that this

581
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,480
in here

582
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,079
the distance to this is smaller than one

583
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,079
right

584
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,400
and so now

585
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,160
so now you have that if you if you now

586
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:50,880
set

587
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:54,079
r equal to uh 1 plus the maximum

588
00:35:50,880 --> 00:36:03,040
of the distance from

589
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:06,000
uh uh x n x capital n to x i

590
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,720
where i here

591
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,599
is runs from one up to capital n minus

592
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,480
one. So there are n minus one of these

593
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:21,040
right that you take the maximum over

594
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,280
right. So if you define little r to be

595
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,760
like this then obviously little r is

596
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:32,480
some positive number it's finite right

597
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:36,240
uh and and you have that and and now I

598
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,520
claim that our set a here is contained

599
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:44,480
in this ball here around xn. So I claim

600
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,480
I claim this thing here.

601
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Okay.

602
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:06,640
Now let's see. So why is this the case?

603
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:12,599
So if we have if x here if capital so we

604
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,599
need to prove that we need to show

605
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,079
that for all

606
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,880
and you have that the distance here

607
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:37,440
is less and not right if that's the case

608
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,680
then the whole set here would lie in in

609
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,079
in in this board right but you see that

610
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:49,680
if n here

611
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:54,240
well if n is bigger equal to capital n

612
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:57,560
but this remember that then we have then

613
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,560
we have

614
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,280
So this is uh right. So we need to show

615
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,359
this in here. If little n is bigger than

616
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,640
capital n then we have that the distance

617
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,400
from this little end to this one here.

618
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,920
Right? The tail tail was less than one.

619
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,480
Right? But this thing here is actually

620
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,280
right by this is actually less or equal

621
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,920
to r because it was one plus this

622
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,960
maximum and then this is maximum over

623
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,960
non- negative numbers. Right? So you see

624
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,880
that for the whole tail we have this

625
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,520
property

626
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:46,400
but for all the other ones right for

627
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:50,160
n less or equal less than n minus one

628
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,440
right these are the the remaining ones

629
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,960
well there the distance

630
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,440
from

631
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,480
x n to x capital n

632
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,359
Uh it's this is one of these guys,

633
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,160
right? So it's clearly this one here is

634
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,119
clearly less than

635
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,359
capital, right? And it's really strictly

636
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,520
less than because that's this one also,

637
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,440
right? Yeah.

638
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,160
>> Does it have to be one plus the max or

639
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,400
could it be the max of one for all those

640
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,040
elements in the sequence?

641
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,560
>> Uh I wanted it's this one here to be

642
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,560
strict.

643
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,880
It's just a silly thing, but that's why

644
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,720
I took it like that. Yeah, because

645
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,960
otherwise this would be sweet. But it's

646
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,560
just a a trivial thing. Uh, and it

647
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,000
doesn't matter very much. If at this

648
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,440
stage it makes no difference actually,

649
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,960
but it was just to use this. We'll talk

650
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,599
a little bit more about the balls

651
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,040
because there is another way, you know,

652
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,160
you could define the ball. Maybe I'll

653
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,880
say a few words about that now.

654
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,880
Okay. So, this here. So, so what this

655
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:05,040
prove again is that in any metric space

656
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,960
a a cruise sequence is automatically

657
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,119
bounded right and so remember in any

658
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,280
metric space a convergence sequence is a

659
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,839
cushy sequence so a convergence sequence

660
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,640
is also bounded right

661
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,640
and now you now there's this question

662
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,880
which is a natural question and this is

663
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,280
connected to the definition of ball

664
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,920
so the way we define and it's actually

665
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,079
worthwhile emphasizing because it's

666
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,400
useful in the next uh thing that we want

667
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:40,079
to get to.

668
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:42,000
And so when I define a ball, I assumed

669
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,880
so the definition of the ball, let me

670
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,359
just write it up again here.

671
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,119
Uh so the definition of a ball in a

672
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,720
metric space, these are the y in this

673
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,880
set. So that the distance

674
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,599
to the center is strictly less than

675
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,000
right. You could of course have defined

676
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,000
it differently.

677
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,400
You could define it that this is

678
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,680
strictly le or instead of strictly less

679
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,440
less or equal to. Right? I I want to use

680
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,920
strictly less here. Yeah. But sometimes

681
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,560
if I want to be very clear I will talk

682
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,560
about open and closed ball. And this is

683
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,720
what we're getting to next, right? And

684
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,839
so when I talking about open ball, but I

685
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,359
I'll try not to use that term here. Uh

686
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:36,720
but but open would always mean this.

687
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,200
Closed ball will mean that it's less or

688
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,920
equal to. Sorry.

689
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,400
>> You were talking about like example.

690
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,440
>> Yeah.

691
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,960
>> Like is that referred to like is X in

692
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,960
that case like a subset of

693
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,680
>> Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Exactly.

694
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,880
That's right. And so so now uh and and I

695
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,800
didn't you know this I I didn't actually

696
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,280
in the I already posted the lecture

697
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,720
notes and so in the lecture notes I

698
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,520
didn't actually talk about tupa

699
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,560
neighborhood but it's it is it it maybe

700
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,839
is worth thinking about. So you could

701
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,880
you could look at as so you again you

702
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,880
have a metric space here

703
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,160
and you could have a subset

704
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,000
A here is a subset any subset of the

705
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,760
metric space

706
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,800
and you could define the tupler

707
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,200
neighborhood of a subset and so you

708
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,079
could do this similarly. So this would

709
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:40,960
be the y in x. So that the distance from

710
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,440
y to

711
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:50,160
um to

712
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:53,560
uh x x here is strictly less than r

713
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,560
for some

714
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,040
x

715
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:04,240
in it. You see what I mean? So this here

716
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,560
is like this is how so again if you take

717
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,400
if you think about our tree you take

718
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,960
some I mean maybe we shouldn't talk

719
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,680
about maybe we should draw it more crazy

720
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,400
like some curve maybe

721
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,800
and if you're looking at the set that

722
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,319
are have distance and most this is like

723
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,319
some sort of tube like this

724
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,040
right this is like uh this here would be

725
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,800
the sinks and then here at the end you

726
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,560
know it look like a cap like this,

727
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,280
right? This here would be like a tubular

728
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,200
neighborhood of this curve. Yeah.

729
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,720
Okay.

730
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,720
And and so as you saying that in the

731
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,440
case where a here is just a point then

732
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,440
those two coincides.

733
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,680
Okay. So now like one of the key things

734
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,880
uh one of the key things when you're

735
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,359
thinking about convergence in in R

736
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,319
remember that this stuff and we use this

737
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,280
time and time again that it was often

738
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:12,800
you know we saw this for series that it

739
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,560
was often difficult to determine the

740
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,680
exact limit of a series right but the

741
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,640
question was always does it converge

742
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,760
right and so if it converge

743
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,640
If it converts then often often you know

744
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,599
you I mean also if you were have using

745
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,640
this in some sort of application it's

746
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,560
it's often in all kind of fields that it

747
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,079
comes up that things are written in

748
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,319
terms of a series and it's it's not

749
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,560
clear what is converting to but you want

750
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,520
to know whether it's converting and then

751
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,480
you also want to so you want to estimate

752
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,319
what is the limit within a certain error

753
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,760
term. Right? And you can use some of

754
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:59,440
these comparison tests to to to

755
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:03,839
determine to to to estimate how close

756
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,920
you are to the actual limit. Okay.

757
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,440
But in any case, right, the thing is

758
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:13,040
it's very useful to have a criteria that

759
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,839
say that is easy to work with and that

760
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,079
uh say that it's converging without

761
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,240
having to be able to find the limits,

762
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:23,520
right? And like the cus sequence, this

763
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:29,200
was like a notion of that, right? And so

764
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:32,480
so the again the and the key on on R the

765
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,720
key for using that was the Banano bio

766
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,440
theorem.

767
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,200
So this was the one that was the key for

768
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:46,359
using to to get the cush convergence

769
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,359
theorem. So the pulsano vas are simil.

770
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:02,319
So remember that this was this is four R

771
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:05,800
and it say that any any any

772
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,800
bounded sequence

773
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,880
has a convergent subsequence Right.

774
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,560
That was what I assume in a general

775
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,480
metric space. This, you know, it it

776
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,440
makes sense to talk about a bounded

777
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,599
uh sequence, right?

778
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,839
uh but it's not it's not always the case

779
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,640
that a bounded sequence has a convergent

780
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:46,640
subsequence. So it does not hold the

781
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,480
bolano does not hold. So, so, so warning

782
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,440
um

783
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,920
uh balsana vas

784
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,920
does not hold

785
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,960
in a general metric space.

786
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,040
And in fact, of course, you know, the

787
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:18,000
example that we looked at with um with

788
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,440
where the example was x here like this

789
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,880
and where we're looking at that

790
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,520
sequence, this is a bounded sequence,

791
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,440
but it's uh it's bounded, but it doesn't

792
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,440
have a convergent subsequence, right?

793
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,760
It's a actually sequence, but it doesn't

794
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,560
have, right? So, it doesn't hold in a

795
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,280
general metric space,

796
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,280
but it does hold

797
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:47,720
It does hold

798
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,720
if the metric space

799
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,520
is compact.

800
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,160
And so that's what I want to talk about

801
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,040
next. But in order to talk about uh what

802
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,760
it means for metric space to be compact

803
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:09,280
then I need to

804
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,720
to talk about

805
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,760
uh I need to define what it means for a

806
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,720
set to be open.

807
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:23,720
Okay. So

808
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,720
so so we need the notion

809
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,920
We need the notion

810
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,839
of an open set, an open

811
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,839
subset

812
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,079
of a metric space.

813
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,680
Okay, so we have a metric space again.

814
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:02,880
And so A here

815
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:05,440
is set to be let's call it O for open. O

816
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,800
is set to be

817
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,800
an open subset

818
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:21,680
if for all

819
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:25,200
uh X in O.

820
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:32,160
So the idea is that you have here this

821
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:34,640
here is this here is O. So O is

822
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,000
this is maybe O.

823
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:41,119
And so the idea is that for each element

824
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,400
there exists some ball centered at that

825
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:49,720
point. So for each x for all x in O

826
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,720
there they exist

827
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,920
r greater than zero. It may be

828
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:03,119
incredible small so that not just x but

829
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:06,480
the whole board around x is contained in

830
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:10,640
the open set. So you see that not just

831
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,520
this point here but the whole ball here

832
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,280
would have to be contained in O right.

833
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:19,839
So in this picture here my when I'm

834
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,440
illustrating this I'm thinking about

835
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:25,680
excis being R2 and I'm thinking about

836
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,440
the distance being the usual ukian

837
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,680
distance right and then but then

838
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,559
actually if this is open it means that

839
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,800
you cannot include these points here on

840
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,200
this curve right they would not be

841
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,200
included in the set because if you take

842
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:46,160
any point on this boundary here so to

843
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:49,599
then a ball part of it would be outside

844
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,160
the set. Right? So, so if this hair

845
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,720
really was open, then this curve here

846
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,800
was not included. And you see that as

847
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,400
you're getting closer and closer to that

848
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,160
curve,

849
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,040
you know, you can still have a little

850
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,960
ball that is inside the set, but as

851
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,839
you're getting closer, the radius of

852
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,400
this little ball have to be smaller.

853
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:13,280
But that's fine.

854
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,160
Okay. So this is what it means for a

855
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,400
subsets to be open.

856
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:24,079
And the first the first thing uh that

857
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:29,520
you observe that with this definition

858
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:35,079
there are always two open subsets. So so

859
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:35,079
again this thing here. So note

860
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,920
that the empty set but there's no

861
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,079
condition if there was a empty set it

862
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,240
say for all element in the set but there

863
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:51,440
is no element so there's nothing to to

864
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:55,720
to be satisfied so the empty set and all

865
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,720
of x are open subset

866
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:09,119
okay so So, so do note that, right? So,

867
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:15,280
in particular, if if like so, so if you

868
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:18,079
take if X here was not the whole real

869
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:22,400
line, but it was just an interval from 0

870
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:25,599
to one and then the distance between

871
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:28,960
elements was the usual distance. Then

872
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:33,680
actually even the closed interval which

873
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:36,559
is the whole set would be open right. So

874
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:41,000
so you just should be careful with you

875
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,000
know what the set is right

876
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,200
with what the set is.

877
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:50,079
Uh okay. Um

878
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,119
so so now

879
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:56,800
right so now the key here is that that

880
00:52:53,119 --> 00:53:00,400
so if you have an open set you know how

881
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,760
do you kind of construct

882
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:08,319
um well maybe the first thing I should

883
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:12,000
do is I should prove a lema

884
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:14,160
that is the following

885
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,760
and then then after that we will talk

886
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:22,319
about how to

887
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:25,280
get lots of uh open sets.

888
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:29,119
So let me so we have two example at the

889
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,200
moment we have two examples of so so

890
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,599
right by so if you take a metric space

891
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,400
at the moment we know that there's

892
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,720
always two subsets that are open the

893
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,920
empty set and and and x but they're not

894
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,000
very interesting so a more interesting

895
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,520
example is that if you take a metric

896
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,559
space

897
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,119
and you take a ball and now it's crucial

898
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:54,960
how we define the ball and so it's

899
00:53:51,119 --> 00:54:00,319
crucial that that it this inequality is

900
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:03,280
strict. Okay. So for a metric space X

901
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:07,520
here is in X it could be it's it could

902
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:11,520
be any element in in in X this thing

903
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:14,480
here R here is positive strictly

904
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:18,559
positive it it's also has to be strictly

905
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:22,160
positive then this thing here is open

906
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,559
any metric ball like this is is is an

907
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,200
open subset

908
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,880
okay let's try to prove that And again

909
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,960
when you're proving things like this for

910
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,280
a metric space

911
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,160
the only non-trivial thing is a triangle

912
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,079
inequality. So this is relying on the

913
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,839
triangle inequality.

914
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,240
And so

915
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:46,400
for a lot of things when you're proving

916
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:50,240
things about a metric space it's often

917
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,640
quite helpful to draw a little picture.

918
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,839
So, but of course you had to be careful

919
00:54:52,640 --> 00:55:01,200
with again that then the intuition comes

920
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:03,440
from you know RN or and uh and sometimes

921
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,000
the metric is a little bit more

922
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,160
complicated than that. So this here

923
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,760
imagine that this is the ball of radius

924
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:18,640
R. Here you have some X.

925
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:22,960
Now take a element Y. So suppose that y

926
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:28,520
here is now in this ball here.

927
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,520
Then we want to show want to show

928
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:38,680
that there exist

929
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,680
that for some

930
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:46,240
s bigger than zero the ball here of

931
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,880
radius s around y is now contained in

932
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,240
this ball here.

933
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:58,760
So here you have y and we want to prove

934
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,760
that there's some little ball around y

935
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:03,920
that is contained in the original ball.

936
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,079
Right?

937
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,960
And so again this is going to rely on

938
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:12,480
the triangle inequality.

939
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:15,200
So you take you have y here. y was

940
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:20,240
supposed to be in this ball here. This

941
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:23,920
means that the distance from X to Y is

942
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:28,799
strictly less than R. Right?

943
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,280
You take now S here to be R minus this

944
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:34,559
distance here.

945
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,839
Okay. Why do I do this again in my

946
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,520
picture here? I have here X. I have here

947
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:43,119
Y.

948
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:47,119
And our intuition is that if we kind of

949
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:50,319
go from X and we go through Y and then

950
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:56,240
we go straight to the boundary then this

951
00:56:50,319 --> 00:57:02,160
thing here is D X comma Y and this one

952
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:05,359
here is R minus D X right this is the

953
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,880
remaining this whole here is R. This

954
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:11,760
here is DX Y. So this here must be be

955
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,280
this here, right? And so if you're

956
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,240
setting this equal to S and now you

957
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:21,280
imagine taking a ball here, well then at

958
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:24,640
least on the picture this whole ball is

959
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,280
contained in the original ball, right?

960
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,359
So so let's try to see if that works,

961
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,400
right? If that works, then it really

962
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:35,040
only used the triangle.

963
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,799
So we're setting S equal to this and

964
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:42,960
then we're looking at this ball here

965
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:46,640
around S and we take an element here

966
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:50,280
in this ball and we now need to prove so

967
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,280
we need to show

968
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,440
we want to prove that this whole ball is

969
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,280
contained in the original B. So this

970
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,280
means that we need to prove that for any

971
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:06,160
such element

972
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:10,359
set here is in this thing here

973
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,359
right that's what we need to prove

974
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,880
and so now you see

975
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:25,359
uh

976
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,359
so we take um right so we take C so

977
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,280
we're now looking at So we're going to

978
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:32,000
look at this distance, right? In order

979
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,119
to prove this, we need to prove that the

980
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,559
distance from C to X is strictly less

981
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:41,680
than R. So let's examine that distance.

982
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:45,200
Triangle inequalities say that this is

983
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:50,160
is bounded by the distance from X to Y

984
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:53,920
plus the distance from Y to C.

985
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:59,040
This one here from Y to C.

986
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:01,680
C lie in the ball of radius S around Y.

987
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,400
So this means that this this thing here

988
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,440
this thing here is lesser is strictly

989
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:12,960
less than S. Right? And so you see that

990
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:17,760
this thing here is now uh less than

991
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:21,760
uh d x y

992
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:24,000
uh + s. Now you fill in what S is. This

993
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:30,240
here

994
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,799
S was equal to R minus DX Y. That was

995
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,920
the definition of S. And so now you see

996
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:38,319
that this thing here is R, right?

997
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,640
Because those two cancel out. And you

998
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:44,880
see that this here I guarantee you that

999
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:46,799
the inequality was strict, right? And so

1000
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,359
right so it really is that that whole

1001
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:51,599
ball was. So we conclude that this whole

1002
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:55,040
ball here

1003
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:58,079
uh was contained in in the original ball

1004
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,559
right and and again

1005
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,000
again the proof of it was just from this

1006
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:07,119
picture right that you make kind of

1007
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,440
rigorous and the only non-trivial things

1008
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,599
at the moment we really have in a metric

1009
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,040
space is a triangle in quantum right

1010
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,640
because we haven't built up a lot of

1011
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:18,079
stuff

1012
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,960
okay so so So, so actually so this as

1013
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:27,680
you see this immediately gave you a lot

1014
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:30,720
of example of um of open subsets of a

1015
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,119
general metric space and if we had

1016
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,040
looked at exactly the same stuff this

1017
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,720
with tupal neighborhood we we would find

1018
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,720
that those are also open subsets. Are we

1019
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,480
also going to look at subsets or are

1020
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:45,440
those like common value

1021
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,920
>> close? Yeah, very much so. Uh but we

1022
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:51,599
haven't defined what it means to be

1023
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:54,160
close. Uh but you you're right that and

1024
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,240
we'll do this uh you're right that uh

1025
01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:00,160
but we so at the moment we don't know

1026
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:02,160
what a closed thing is you know uh and

1027
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,839
maybe I will just define it and then

1028
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,119
then then

1029
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:08,960
we can so

1030
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:12,240
okay

1031
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,280
so let's define

1032
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:19,440
so I but I'll talk more about this next

1033
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,440
time but now when you're asking

1034
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:27,280
So again, so we have X here

1035
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,799
is is a metric space again and then C

1036
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:35,240
here

1037
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:35,240
it's a subset of X is set to be closed

1038
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:48,559
and then now it's may may seems almost

1039
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:51,559
cheating. said to be closed if the

1040
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,559
complement.

1041
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:02,160
So this means that the complement of of

1042
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:06,839
C. So the complement of C. So the

1043
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,839
complement of C the complement

1044
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:19,040
of C. Right? This is these are all the

1045
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:22,240
these are the x all the x in x so that x

1046
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:25,200
is not in c.

1047
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Okay.

1048
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:31,760
So the complement of a set is everything

1049
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:35,119
in x that is not in that set. Okay. And

1050
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:39,520
a set is set to be closed if the

1051
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:43,280
complement is open. Okay.

1052
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:46,480
And so now once you have this definition

1053
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:49,280
and I'll prove this next time that uh

1054
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:54,400
that if you're looking at

1055
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:56,720
what I denote like this so this is the

1056
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:02,079
elements

1057
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:04,240
where the distance to uh x is less or

1058
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,520
equal to. So this here is not any more

1059
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,680
strict right this thing here is then a

1060
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,720
closed set. Okay.

1061
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:15,680
>> Could you also define it by like the way

1062
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,680
we define an open subset but saying that

1063
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:20,319
arc instead of being strictly

1064
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,000
>> No. No. I couldn't define it like that.

1065
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,599
Yeah. Right. But so I mean you could

1066
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,119
define it other ways. There's another

1067
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,680
standard where we talk about there's

1068
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,079
another equivalent to say that if you

1069
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,160
take but I don't want to get into that

1070
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:37,200
because you know but but there's another

1071
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,520
way. We'll get to this in in in just but

1072
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,839
but uh and and close sets we really

1073
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,920
mostly talk about next time. It was just

1074
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,799
because you're asking

1075
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,799
um but let me just talk about so this

1076
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:51,119
here's one but I'll just repeat this in

1077
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:55,119
just a second.

1078
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:59,280
So in order to produce more sets. So so

1079
01:03:55,119 --> 01:04:01,200
we start with um so by so now so by

1080
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,599
actually I should just note although you

1081
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,359
know just now when I talk about clo you

1082
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,960
know just the definition I should just

1083
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:11,119
immediately note that there are always

1084
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:14,319
two closed sets

1085
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:17,680
because you see the empty set was always

1086
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:20,319
open and the full set was always open.

1087
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:23,680
Right? And so the complement of the

1088
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:26,640
empty set that's everything. So that's

1089
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,960
closed. And the complement of everything

1090
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,799
is nothing. It's empty sets. Right? So

1091
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,599
that's also closed. So those two sets

1092
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:35,839
are always closed. But let me just talk

1093
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:38,559
about so I want to think about you know

1094
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,119
how do you produce

1095
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,240
uh open sets?

1096
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:46,880
So how do you know that that there are a

1097
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:50,559
lot of open sets?

1098
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:54,200
And so if you take sets, if you take so

1099
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,200
this is like operations

1100
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,160
on sets on on on subsets

1101
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,440
of a given set.

1102
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,960
So here I'm thinking about just X as

1103
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,119
being a set. It's it does not need to be

1104
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:23,640
a metric space. So if I take a set then

1105
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:23,640
and I take two elements two subsets.

1106
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:30,400
So these are two subsets. Then I can

1107
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:34,119
form the union of these two.

1108
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,119
This here is the union

1109
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:42,720
and the union here of two sets. So the

1110
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,640
union and again I denote it like this

1111
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:50,160
cup

1112
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:53,280
like this. These are the elements in X

1113
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,760
such that X

1114
01:05:53,280 --> 01:06:00,960
is in U1

1115
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:04,640
or X is in U2

1116
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:08,079
or both. What's

1117
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:10,799
right? And so you often illustrate this

1118
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:13,200
with like if you have this here is X,

1119
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:19,240
this here is U1,

1120
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,240
this here is U2, U1 and U2.

1121
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:25,760
Then this thing here

1122
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,160
is the union

1123
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,880
and likewise the intersection the

1124
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,559
intersections that is lying in both

1125
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,400
sets.

1126
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:38,200
Right?

1127
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,200
So the intersection

1128
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:47,839
the intersection. So this is again you

1129
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,319
have these two sets and this is the

1130
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:55,760
intersection.

1131
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:58,400
So and you denote it like this

1132
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:04,960
and this is the x

1133
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:04,960
so that x is in u1 and

1134
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:11,359
uh x's in the two that's intersection of

1135
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:16,720
these two set

1136
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:18,799
okay and then um then there is a

1137
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,200
third and then let me talk immediately

1138
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,920
about generalization of this so there's

1139
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,720
a a third and this is this with a

1140
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,359
complement but let me also introduce the

1141
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:34,720
notation

1142
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:38,160
so if you take this subset of X than the

1143
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:41,119
complement and and people

1144
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:44,559
there are sort of slightly different

1145
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:47,520
ways of doing it of defining it uh or

1146
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,599
not defining it but of notation for it

1147
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:52,160
and I always use this one because I

1148
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:55,440
think that's the clearest one. So this

1149
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:57,200
is like x take away u and this is

1150
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,520
totally standard. There's another one

1151
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,280
that's often used where you have C

1152
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,839
that's slightly less standard than this

1153
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:07,280
one and sometimes it can be confusing.

1154
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:10,079
This one can never be confusing.

1155
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,760
And so this thing here is a complement

1156
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:19,359
and so this means that it's the X

1157
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:22,359
such that X does not belong to you.

1158
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,359
Okay.

1159
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:28,239
And so now uh okay so that's like

1160
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:31,040
standard operation of sets but there is

1161
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:34,400
a generalization of this of this union

1162
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,480
here where instead of just two sets you

1163
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:39,279
could take potentially infinitely many

1164
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:42,719
sets. So if you take a family of

1165
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:45,719
subsets. So if you alpha here is a

1166
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,719
family

1167
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,960
of subsets

1168
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:56,799
then you could look at the union of the

1169
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:59,920
u alpha. This is like denoted like this.

1170
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:02,719
And this is the x

1171
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:07,359
in in x

1172
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:10,679
such that x is in u alpha

1173
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,679
for some

1174
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:17,120
uh alpha. I mean it could be in many of

1175
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:21,359
the u alphas but it has to be at least

1176
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:24,080
one. Right? So this is the union of a

1177
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:28,719
family and likewise the intersection of

1178
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:33,520
a family is the x and then it has to now

1179
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:40,359
lie in all of them right it's x in x

1180
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:40,359
where x is in u alpha for all alpha

1181
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,640
okay that's a union and the

1182
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,640
intersections family

1183
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:55,199
Okay. Uh and so now

1184
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:59,120
um

1185
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:01,600
let me look at some example.

1186
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:04,239
uh in particular

1187
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,719
uh let me look at

1188
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:09,280
the

1189
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:12,280
uh an example of this

1190
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,280
uh

1191
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:24,480
and then let me prove something about uh

1192
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:27,280
open sets. So let me look at an example

1193
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:31,199
here.

1194
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:34,320
Suppose that u alpha or u n I'm just

1195
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:38,640
going to look at is going to be now a

1196
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:41,120
family of subsets of the real line and

1197
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,840
they're going to be indexed by the

1198
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:49,040
natural number. So this thing here is

1199
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:51,360
going to be minus one / n to 1 / n.

1200
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:53,520
And if I'm looking at the union of these

1201
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:57,760
guys,

1202
01:10:53,520 --> 01:11:04,239
but you see this is this is a a this is

1203
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:06,239
a sequence of of um of uh of open sets,

1204
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:09,600
right? I mean it's like for each n you

1205
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:11,760
have a open set, but they are as n get

1206
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,920
larger they're smaller. The first one is

1207
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,239
the biggest one. So if you take the

1208
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,800
union of these guys

1209
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:21,440
that just gives you the the first one

1210
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,840
you started with. So this is the union

1211
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:27,199
of these right?

1212
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:30,000
If you take the intersection of them

1213
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:35,640
well the only thing that is in all of

1214
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,640
these sets that's actually this zero

1215
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,640
right. Okay.

1216
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,719
Now um

1217
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:46,400
now we need some we need some stuff

1218
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:51,840
about

1219
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:54,480
uh operations of sets and so how does uh

1220
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,880
things and so there's some standard

1221
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:00,000
operations

1222
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:04,080
uh and

1223
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,960
my recommendation is that

1224
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,800
not try to remember this

1225
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,560
uh I don't remember it myself so I

1226
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,080
always have to kind of run through but

1227
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,360
the once you have done it once or twice

1228
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:20,320
the proof is so trivial that it's not

1229
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,000
worth remembering and and I think if the

1230
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,880
danger if you try to remember these

1231
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,400
things you may remember it wrong and

1232
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:30,239
that's much worse than just running

1233
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:34,000
through the proof so so you have so you

1234
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:37,120
have the following lema here

1235
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,719
so you have a set and then you have

1236
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:44,480
subsets

1237
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:48,880
uh um uh let's call it a b and then and

1238
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:51,840
then a family uh of subsets

1239
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,800
and the thing is the first one is that

1240
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,880
if you take the complement of the

1241
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,920
complement

1242
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:03,920
so if you take a and you take everything

1243
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:06,080
that is not in a right

1244
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:09,040
so just think about it that if you take

1245
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:12,239
so here you have x here you have A, this

1246
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:15,760
is A. If everything that is not in A,

1247
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:19,040
that's over here, right? But then if

1248
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,280
it's not over here, then it's A. So the

1249
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:23,199
first one,

1250
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,800
it's just that, right? And actually, we

1251
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,560
sort of just because we're also running

1252
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,120
out of time, right? We really prove

1253
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,679
this, right? I mean, so if you have

1254
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:34,880
something that is not in A, then it's

1255
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:38,560
lie here. But if it's not lie here, then

1256
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,600
it lie there. That's that statement.

1257
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,719
Okay.

1258
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,400
[Music]

1259
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:46,320
The second one is that if you take the

1260
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:50,080
complement

1261
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:53,880
of that it's in the union

1262
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,880
of these guys.

1263
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:02,000
So if it's not

1264
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:05,760
this just means that it's not in any of

1265
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,640
these guys. Right? This here is the set.

1266
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:11,920
Imagine that you have something that

1267
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:15,440
looks like you have a bunch of sets like

1268
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:19,199
this. These are the the this is supposed

1269
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:22,000
to illustrate the a alphas and if it's

1270
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,600
not this say that if it's not in any of

1271
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,440
these

1272
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:29,120
well then the claim is that then it's

1273
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,040
it's it's

1274
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,800
in the intersection

1275
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:37,360
of that it's not in this one. It's not

1276
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,199
in this one and it's not in this one and

1277
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:43,320
it's not in that one. Right? So that's

1278
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:43,320
also clear enough. Right?

1279
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:50,320
So this is the second one. Again I I

1280
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:52,719
actually wrote out the proof uh in the

1281
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:57,400
notes um

1282
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,400
um so you you can check that out.

1283
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:07,560
And the third operation,

1284
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:18,320
the third operation is that if you take

1285
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:24,679
uh if you take uh x and you are removing

1286
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:24,679
the intersection of this family.

1287
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,800
So this means that it is not so this

1288
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,760
means that the intersection of the

1289
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:38,000
family this in this picture here would

1290
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:41,199
be this thing here and so it's not right

1291
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,159
there everything else is allowed right

1292
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:50,600
but that's the same you see that's the

1293
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:50,600
same as the union of x take away

1294
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,040
right this here is this here is the

1295
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,320
element

1296
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:01,199
that is in not in one of that that

1297
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:04,080
there's at least one of the u alpha a

1298
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:08,000
alpha where it's not in right and so

1299
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:12,560
that's the same so this is this is uh

1300
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,880
the same as this okay again um I wrote

1301
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,120
it out in in the notes the proof

1302
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:21,199
actually right of these things right

1303
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:25,199
okay

1304
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:27,520
and let me just say Maybe we can't quite

1305
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:31,679
uh I mean we'll pick up in the notes

1306
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:36,000
where uh the other stuff but let me just

1307
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:39,120
say that uh when you prove this sort of

1308
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:43,600
thing and and we even did this here when

1309
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,520
in in this when I'm just illustrating it

1310
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:50,320
with a picture.

1311
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:52,320
So um so we prove it using the following

1312
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:55,520
sort of trivial lema and I wrote that

1313
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:58,000
out as a lema in the notes that if you

1314
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,480
are trying to prove that two sets are

1315
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,440
equal right so suppose you're trying to

1316
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:06,480
prove that two sets are equal then in a

1317
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:11,000
way it's natural to divide this into two

1318
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:11,000
parts. So this is the same

1319
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,719
as proving

1320
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:27,520
that A is contained in B and

1321
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:30,000
B is contained in A. Right? So if you're

1322
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,760
trying to prove that two sets are equal,

1323
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,440
then you would prove that for any

1324
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,520
elements in A, it's also at B. This is

1325
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,480
this thing. And you prove that for any

1326
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:43,520
element B, it's also an A, right? And so

1327
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:46,719
that's that's you know when I wrote out

1328
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,800
the proof of this these three things,

1329
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,280
then I wrote it out like each of them

1330
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,600
has two parts, right? That you prove

1331
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,960
that this set is contained in that and

1332
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:59,239
you prove that this is contained in

1333
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,239
that. Okay?

1334
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,800
Now,

1335
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:08,239
uh right, we're almost actually there.

1336
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:12,960
Um so so now

1337
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:17,120
let me um let me just

1338
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:18,800
say that so that's actually in in one of

1339
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:22,560
the

1340
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:25,600
one of the pets problem but that's no

1341
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:28,400
pet it's uh you have a little break now

1342
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,480
for pet sets uh because I want to make

1343
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:32,239
sure that that there is no pet in

1344
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,640
material we haven't yet covered in class

1345
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:37,280
so that's why there's a

1346
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,600
and and and anyway the all of the pieet

1347
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,600
at this point I actually posted. So the

1348
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,920
the last one I think is due I forget

1349
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:46,239
whether it's the 8th of May or something

1350
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,840
like that and there's again there's five

1351
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:54,560
left you've already done fine. Okay. So

1352
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:58,320
now uh if you take uh if you take if X

1353
01:18:54,560 --> 01:19:00,719
here B is a metric space then you have

1354
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:07,239
the following lema

1355
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:07,239
that if O alpha are open subsets

1356
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:16,840
then the union of the O alpha is also

1357
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,840
open

1358
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,640
right And this is actually but this is

1359
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,199
quite trivial as you see I'll just

1360
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:29,800
indicate why but it's actually left on a

1361
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:29,800
pie set. So the proof here

1362
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:36,640
but I will just illustrate it anyway

1363
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:39,199
that if you take a element here in the

1364
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,040
union.

1365
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,960
Well, this means that this means that

1366
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,800
there exist

1367
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,960
you

1368
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:52,239
this means that that x is in

1369
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:55,239
alpha for some alpha, right? For some

1370
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,239
alpha

1371
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:01,360
but this means that there is a ball

1372
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,360
around it because this here is open. It

1373
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:09,600
means that there's a little ball around

1374
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:11,760
it that is contained in in this, right?

1375
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,080
But therefore, it's also contained in

1376
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,280
the union

1377
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,840
of these guys,

1378
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:24,239
right? And so this this is really just a

1379
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,760
proof that the union of open sets are

1380
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,920
open.

1381
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,719
And next time, so we're out of time now,

1382
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:34,000
but next time we'll talk about why if

1383
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:37,360
you take finally many sets, why the

1384
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,840
intersection of finitely many sets

1385
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:44,080
of finite many open sets, why that is

1386
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:47,280
also open. But for intersection of open

1387
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:50,400
set, you have to be careful because for

1388
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:53,199
union, you can take the union of any

1389
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:57,120
number of open sets. It's always open.

1390
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:59,679
But for for if you take intersection you

1391
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:02,880
it's in general it's only true that

1392
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:04,719
finite intersections are open and the

1393
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:08,960
example is one of the examples we looked

1394
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:13,199
at before where you take these sets here

1395
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,600
they are these sets are open subsets

1396
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:18,480
but if you take the intersection of all

1397
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:22,000
of them then you just get zero and

1398
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:26,199
that's not a open subset. Okay. So,

1399
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,199
okay. So, we're we're done.
