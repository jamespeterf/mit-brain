00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,640
so we're going to be performing a

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,720
combustion reaction we're going to be

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,160
combusting about 25 Ms of isopropyl

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,960
alcohol the energy produced from 25 M of

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,080
isopropyl alcohol is about 405 K which

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,439
is equivalent to about 97 nutritional

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,960
food calories so if you're eaing

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,119
something with 100 food calories you'll

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,610
get a picture of how much energy you

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:38,440
have to burn to get rid of that

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:40,840
