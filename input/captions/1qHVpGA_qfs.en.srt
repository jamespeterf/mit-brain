1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:21,560
Okay. So last time we um we looked at

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,560
power series.

3
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,080
So you have a sequence uh am

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,080
uh this is a sequence

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,160
And then for each

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,840
for each x you form the the new series

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,840
you form the series

8
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,360
um and the series is where a n * x ^ n

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,920
and then you're summing you decide

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,520
somewhere to start and then you're

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,440
summing to infinitive like that.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,320
So something like this that's a power

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,360
series and we looked at a particular

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:15,439
case u where the a ends so example here

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,720
is where a n is equal to 1 / n factorial

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:24,560
uh and so we got the function

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:28,799
e of x which is a sum from n =0 to

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,799
infinity of x ^ n divided by n

19
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,799
factorial.

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,000
And then we

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,640
we use this

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,040
to we observed that we observed that uh

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,840
e is bigger equal to zero

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:58,000
for x bigger equal to zero.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:01,119
And we also observe that e of uh of zero

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,479
is equal to one.

27
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,879
And we defined little e to be e this

28
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,560
function e of one.

29
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:20,000
And then we defined another function

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:22,560
um uh e to the q where q here is now a

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,760
rational number.

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,280
Right. And uh it was defined in

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,920
particular E of zero was defined to be

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:38,239
equal to one. E of one was def was uh

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,920
was just defined to be E right.

36
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:48,480
And uh then we also we assumed which we

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:53,519
will prove today that e of x plus e uh e

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,840
capital e of x + y is equal to e of x *

39
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,640
e of y.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,640
So we assume that

41
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,720
and then we saw and and then we defined

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,800
right. So this little e this function

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,800
based on the little e in particular e to

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,840
some power m if m is an integer

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,400
is just e * itself

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,400
uh m times

47
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:36,080
and then we defined um

48
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:40,239
uh e to a power 1 / n here

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,239
to be uh the positive number. This was

50
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,239
defined

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,799
to be

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,799
a positive number

53
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:01,599
so that uh alpha is saying so that alpha

54
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:05,360
raised to the power n is equal to e.

55
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,920
uh and and and we also defined

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,640
um e to a negative integer

57
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,840
and this was just to be defined to one /

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,000
so we defined e to minus m to 1 / e to

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,919
the

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,120
so this way we defined uh uh we this

61
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:30,320
function here the power series was

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,960
defined for for all x and we defined

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:39,280
another function little e of q uh on all

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:43,680
rational numbers q right and then

65
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:49,280
we saw we assume this here we saw that

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:53,280
uh that these two functions so e of x is

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,960
equal to e this function here is only

68
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,479
defined on rational numbers so

69
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,400
it's they're equal when uh for at

70
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:08,800
rational numbers. So we saw that

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,880
and then in in the P sets

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,199
P set five I think it's for both of them

73
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,440
you will show or maybe it's one for four

74
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,360
and one for five you show that E is

75
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,439
continuous

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,439
[Applause]

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,600
uh and uh you will also show that that E

78
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,600
is the so it would also Show the

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
following

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,120
that if you have if f and g are two

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,120
continuous functions

82
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,320
uh and h so they are defined both of

83
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,880
them f both f and g are defined on the

84
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,880
real numbers.

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,280
and you assume that if you restrict them

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,319
to the rational numbers then the two

87
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,440
functions are equal.

88
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,000
So if they're both continuous and they

89
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,280
agree on the rational numbers then

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,280
actually they must agree everywhere

91
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,560
uh on all

92
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,039
Okay. So in other words,

93
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,280
this one here,

94
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,759
you know, this is a function by P sub5.

95
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,840
It's a function that's continuous on all

96
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:54,479
of R. It's agree with this function. And

97
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,240
so this is the the only extension of

98
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,880
this function

99
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,199
to be continuous and defined on all of

100
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,199
them.

101
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,440
Okay. So now, but we still needed to

102
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,520
prove

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,039
we still needed to prove this

104
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,120
relationship here that we assumed. So

105
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,440
let's try to prove this one here. And

106
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:22,599
I'll just do a the main case of it. Um

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,599
and so we're going to prove so theorem

108
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,919
prove that E of X * Y is equal to E of X

109
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:37,160
time e to the y

110
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,160
and I I'm going to show this proof

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,800
uh in the case

112
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,800
where

113
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,560
where these are non negative numbers

114
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,400
both of them the general cases is once

115
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
you have this is the general case is not

116
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,240
very difficult but I won't do the

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
general

118
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:07,039
Now how are we going to prove that? So

119
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:10,080
to prove that we're going to use

120
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,720
another theorem. So the other theorem is

121
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:19,360
that so we take two suppose you have two

122
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:23,039
um suppose you take two series of non

123
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,879
each of them are of non- negative

124
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,479
numbers.

125
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,160
So,

126
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,240
so the setup is so again this is going

127
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,039
to go into the proof of that theorem

128
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,360
over there but the setup for this is

129
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:45,320
is more general.

130
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,320
I take a series A N

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,920
and I take another series BN

132
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,040
and I'm assuming that both A

133
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,560
and B and for all N for is are non

134
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
negative

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,360
so for all

136
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,360
n

137
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,440
so these are series of non- negative

138
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,640
numbers and then I form another series.

139
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,640
Um I will form

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,399
a third series

141
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,240
and that third series is going to be

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,000
defined from from the two previous

143
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,040
series and and the third series is

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,839
called it CN

145
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,839
like this. And now CN here is going to

146
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,040
be the sum

147
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,640
of a i

148
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,240
b

149
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:54,080
uh n minus i i i = 0 to n.

150
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,680
So this has the effect of that that the

151
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,200
index of this plus the index of that is

152
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,880
always adding up to n. Right? So the sum

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,320
of the two indices is is ex is exactly

154
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,160
in right.

155
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,640
Okay. So that's so obviously so note

156
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,640
note that

157
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,560
that the C ends here of course also non-

158
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,040
negative that just sums of non- negative

159
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,040
numbers right?

160
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,839
So this is a new series right of non-

161
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,079
negative numbers.

162
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,079
And then the theorem is so the theorem

163
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,079
is

164
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,600
the theorem is that if

165
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,880
if these series here

166
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,360
this one here and

167
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,360
this one here

168
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
uh are convergent.

169
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,600
Then this series here

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,800
is also converging.

171
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:22,920
And and uh we also have that the sum

172
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,920
here that this sum here

173
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,360
that this sum

174
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:34,200
is just a product of the two sums. So

175
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,200
it's a product of the sum here

176
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,480
like that.

177
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,120
So again we have these two series of

178
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,160
non- negative numbers. From those two

179
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,120
series you form a third series and the

180
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,200
third third series the idea is that the

181
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,600
third series is kind of like a product

182
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,880
of the other two and it's uh the CN in

183
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,760
the third series is given where you take

184
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,240
the sum of the products of the of the

185
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,000
elements in the other two so that the

186
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,360
index is is at n

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and then if these the two series you

188
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,959
started with are convergent then this

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,560
you know product series is also

190
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,279
convergent and the sum of the product

191
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,120
series is is really the product of the

192
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,600
sum of the other two series. Okay.

193
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
Now so that's what we want to prove and

194
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,600
then once we have this we're going to

195
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:47,839
use it to prove this the term here.

196
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,720
uh and so so now to prove it let me just

197
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:56,200
first observe that so let me observe

198
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,200
over here that um

199
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
right so uh let me make a couple of

200
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:08,839
definitions and then making an

201
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,839
observation let me start with

202
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:17,800
with making some definitions

203
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,800
that is useful in the proof.

204
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,720
So

205
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:31,920
we will I'm going to define s n a

206
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:37,680
just kind of like we usually do where we

207
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:42,880
summing here from i = z up to n of a i

208
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:46,880
right the the superscript is is come

209
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:52,079
from the series the a series and then

210
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:54,800
likewise I define uh S and B to be the

211
00:13:52,079 --> 00:14:00,320
sum here

212
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:07,760
of the B eyes and then I'm defining

213
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:11,920
uh S and C to be the sum of the C eyes.

214
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,480
Oops. Up to like that.

215
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:20,320
And so of course you have that we know

216
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:23,519
that a i, b i and ci

217
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,760
are all non- negative numbers. So this

218
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,000
means that convergence

219
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,000
so convergence

220
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,639
of any of these series

221
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,360
right so convergence say of this one is

222
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,920
the same as saying that these numbers

223
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,000
here are bound right that's by mono

224
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,040
converter so convergence of any of these

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,040
series is equivalent

226
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:06,480
to that

227
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:12,279
that the corresponding S n a b or c a b

228
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,279
c is uh are bounded.

229
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,639
Okay. So that's just an observation and

230
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,240
again this is the monot convergence of

231
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,240
this is by

232
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Mon.

233
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,959
Okay.

234
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,600
So that's a monotone convergence

235
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:46,079
theorem. Uh the other thing

236
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,240
uh see I thought of something else I

237
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:56,880
wanted to to note. Um

238
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:59,600
right okay so let's try to prove that

239
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,399
so to prove it

240
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,399
let me just

241
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,680
try to

242
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,480
think about it for a second here so if

243
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm looking at a1

244
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,560
say a2

245
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,800
plus

246
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,279
up to a n

247
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,519
suppose I'm looking at this here. This

248
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,519
is like this is like SN

249
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,600
A, right?

250
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,639
And I have that SNA and suppose I'm now

251
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,639
looking at the SNB.

252
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,360
This here is the SNP.

253
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,199
Now if you just multiply out the product

254
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,160
of these two right then you would get

255
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,240
and I should have started at zero sorry

256
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,079
let's start at zero because that's what

257
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,600
we do up there like that

258
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,720
okay so now I multiply out and you see

259
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,280
that you're getting a zero

260
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,400
uh b and you're getting then you can

261
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,360
kind of if you try to do it. So, let's

262
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,640
try to multiply this out, but let's do

263
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,079
it in an ordered way. Okay? And when I'm

264
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,919
talking about ordering way, I'm not

265
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,799
talking about just multiplying this one

266
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,400
on that. Uh I mean, you could say that's

267
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:36,240
very ordered, but it's not it's not uh

268
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,400
it it's not related to what the the C

269
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,520
series. So, I want to just group things

270
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,919
so that they remind us of the C series.

271
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,559
But if I do that, so what I starting

272
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,320
with this

273
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,280
uh is is this multip multiplied by this.

274
00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:01,840
Then I take this one here multiply by

275
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:04,799
that. So a z b1 right

276
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,840
this here is the only one where this the

277
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,480
index the the subscripts are non-

278
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,720
negative integers. This is the only one

279
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,919
where the sum of the two subscript is

280
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,640
zero. Right? If I'm looking at where the

281
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,280
sum of the two subscript is one, this is

282
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,600
one of them. But there's another one and

283
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,480
that's where I take this

284
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,799
multiply by that. So I sort of group

285
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,160
those together. So a1 b 0.

286
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,559
And now I want to collect the ones. So

287
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,200
those are the only two where the sum of

288
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,160
the subscript is one. Then if I'm

289
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,440
looking at at the when I'm multiplying

290
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,799
out where the sum of the subscript is

291
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,360
two well I could start with this one but

292
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,919
then I have to pick b2 so I take plus a

293
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,320
z b2

294
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:04,400
then I could take a1 b1 right that's has

295
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:08,960
also sum of subscript two and the last

296
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:14,000
one is if I take a2 But then the B have

297
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,320
to be the zero first. Right?

298
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And now I proceed like this. So I'm

299
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,480
grouping it like this.

300
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay? Now of course there's going to be

301
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,000
a little bit of an issue. So for a while

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,520
everything is you see that this thing

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,320
here this here is what we call C0.

304
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:39,039
This here is C1.

305
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,080
And this here is C2, right? And then we

306
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:46,320
presumably also get C3.

307
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,559
But then there is a point where uh where

308
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,440
we sort of run into trouble

309
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,039
if we want to really do it like this.

310
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,919
So,

311
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,679
so what we get is that. So when you do

312
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:07,160
this multiplication what you will see is

313
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,160
so you see like this a z plus a1

314
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,360
a n

315
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,600
what you will see times b 0

316
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,799
b1

317
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,080
up to bn what you'll see that this

318
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,240
pattern here it's continue for a while

319
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,120
and you're getting that this is equal to

320
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:31,919
c 0 c1 C1 plus C2

321
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:36,640
up to CN.

322
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:39,600
CN in the CN, right? This is again where

323
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,120
the sum of these indices could be this

324
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,960
one here multiply by that the sum of the

325
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,039
subscript will be N. Right?

326
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,280
But if you're now looking at the next

327
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:56,480
one that correspond to CN + one, you're

328
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,159
not getting all of the CN + one because

329
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,720
like one of the CN + one would be like a

330
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,840
to the N +1*

331
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,559
B 0. But you don't have that one here,

332
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,600
right? So what you get is that you're

333
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,600
getting all of these plus something

334
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,600
additional.

335
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,200
Okay. And the additional is because

336
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,960
everything is non negative. The

337
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,360
additional thing is a non- negative

338
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,440
number. Right.

339
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:35,039
Okay. So what we have established here

340
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:38,880
is that we have so this here show that s

341
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:42,880
n c this is here this here is let me

342
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,760
just write like this. This here is sn.

343
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,880
So you see that and this here this here

344
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,640
was SN

345
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,039
this here

346
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,240
this here was S this here was um right

347
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:02,080
this thing here was SN A and this here

348
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:06,080
was SNB right so what you have is so

349
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:13,200
this inequality just tells you that S N

350
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:17,400
A time S NB is equal to S N C plus

351
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,400
something positive not negative.

352
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,200
So in other words, this number here is

353
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:32,640
lesser equal to the product of these

354
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,600
two. So this imply that SN c is less or

355
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,280
equal to this here.

356
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,559
But now you see you already have

357
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,159
something because these here was

358
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,880
increasing

359
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,200
right they were increasing because the a

360
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,679
was all non negative so these here are

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,400
increasing and they are lesser equal to

362
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,360
right there the series was supposed to

363
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,520
be convergent so you have that sorry so

364
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:05,679
I'm here I'm using that the sn

365
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,679
a is is monot increasing up to the limit

366
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,679
here,

367
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:16,000
[Applause]

368
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:20,520
right? And likewise the SN here monc

369
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,520
increasing up to the limit,

370
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,720
right? So this thing here so this is

371
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,200
smaller than the limit. This is smaller

372
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:34,039
than the limit of that. So this thing

373
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,039
here is less or equal to the product

374
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,520
of um of these guys,

375
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,520
right? And so you see and that's that's

376
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,679
supposed to be just a real number this

377
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,760
here. So you see that these guys here

378
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,760
are now bounded.

379
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,559
So this means that because they're

380
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,880
monotone it means that that series is

381
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,480
also convergent.

382
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,440
So what we have concluded here is so

383
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,520
what we have concluded here is

384
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,720
that uh that the series uh that this

385
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,120
series here

386
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,120
is convergent

387
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,200
and we have that uh this infinite sum

388
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
here

389
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,840
is lesser equal to the product of the

390
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,840
other ones.

391
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:39,329
Right. This is what what this gave us.

392
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,329
[Applause]

393
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,559
Right. So this is what we have so far.

394
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,520
Okay. Now

395
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:53,600
we we want to we want to uh right we

396
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,159
want to get the reverse inequality also.

397
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,400
Right. So we want the reverse inequality

398
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
of what is over there. So that we can

399
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,120
say that those two things here are

400
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,360
actually equal. Right? Now let's try to

401
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,240
see how do we prove this the reverse of

402
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,400
this inequality. The reverse we proving

403
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,799
by examine more closely what that

404
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,799
product was.

405
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,559
So you see so what is this additional

406
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,760
thing here?

407
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,600
So again,

408
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,600
so we have we're looking at this thing

409
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
here.

410
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,400
And what we got is that this here was

411
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,760
equal to

412
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,360
the sum here of

413
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:57,840
C N. But then we have some additional

414
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,919
terms right and the additional terms is

415
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,600
the thing is that if you start looking

416
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:09,440
at the additional terms so what are the

417
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:13,200
additional terms you're getting a a1

418
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:17,440
bn right that's one where the sum here

419
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,840
is n + one right and then you also get

420
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,480
so this is coming from this uh sorry

421
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,919
that one here multiplied by this you

422
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,919
would also get a a2

423
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:38,880
b minus 2 you get a a3

424
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:43,039
b sorry not n minus2 n minus one b3 n

425
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:46,159
minus2 right etc right

426
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,320
so but all of these here

427
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,960
all of these here and then right so you

428
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,760
get that

429
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,279
And but you don't get again you don't

430
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,279
get the one that is missing here

431
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,600
is a z b n + one. This one is missing,

432
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,120
right? And the other one that is missing

433
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,840
is this one here.

434
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,360
But otherwise you get all of the ones

435
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,400
that was in the CN + one and you don't

436
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,559
get anything more. Right? And so this

437
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,640
path continues.

438
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,840
So like the next term would be like a2

439
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,760
sorry yeah then you get you would also

440
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,760
get something where the sum of the

441
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:39,760
indices was two that's like a2

442
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:45,440
bn right but here you would be missing

443
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:49,919
more right you'll be missing a z bn + 2

444
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,720
you're missing a1 b n + one right but

445
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,960
you don't get anything more Fine. And so

446
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,360
the thing is like when you continue like

447
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,159
this, the last one you get is like when

448
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:05,200
you're multiplying that by that

449
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:08,799
and that's a n * bn those here the sum

450
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,200
of the indices is two

451
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,760
two n sorry right it's 2 n but you're

452
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,559
missing a lot now right you only have

453
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,760
one of many many terms right but they

454
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,440
they but it is a term that all appear

455
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,159
and this one would appear in C 2n.

456
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,799
So in this way what you have is that

457
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:35,600
this here is less than s to the power 2

458
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,919
n c right they are all in there but you

459
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,840
will be missing terms but all terms are

460
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,399
non- negative right so this means that

461
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,600
you have that in quarter right so you

462
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,559
see that now we have now what we have

463
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,880
here is

464
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,480
that we have

465
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,000
what we established before

466
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:07,120
was the inequality

467
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:10,320
that uh s n c was less than s n a * s n

468
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,200
b. But what we have now here is that

469
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:18,440
this thing here, this product is less

470
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,440
than s 2n c.

471
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,480
This one here is squeezed between this

472
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,279
one here and that one here. But both

473
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:35,440
these here converts to the same. Right?

474
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:37,679
They both converge to this infinite sum.

475
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,679
Right? So these here converts to the

476
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,320
same. This means that this here the

477
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,279
limit of this here must also be the

478
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,279
same. Right? And so this proof this show

479
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,279
that this here is the reverse

480
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,279
inequality.

481
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,679
So proof

482
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:01,760
proof over there, right?

483
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:05,520
Okay. So now so that's

484
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:09,600
um okay. So this is this is this that if

485
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,600
you take two series and you form the

486
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,000
product

487
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,720
then that also converge if the two

488
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,080
series is non- negative numbers. So let

489
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,080
me just make a corner of this

490
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,960
that of course if you take a series here

491
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:34,720
uh and it's a I'll just do a trivial cor

492
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,039
but you can see how you can use this

493
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,919
and this is kind of used in proving the

494
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:43,200
general case. So we we will only yeah I

495
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:47,960
mean so okay so

496
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,960
so suppose I take two series here

497
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,360
so this is a trivial

498
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,279
corary of it suppose I take two series

499
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:01,679
here and I know that this one here that

500
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,679
they're both absolutely convergent

501
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:17,919
If they're both absolutely convergent,

502
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:23,399
then if you take this series here,

503
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,399
CN C, sorry, CI.

504
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,799
Well, uh, this one here I claim is also

505
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,799
absolute converted. Again,

506
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:49,279
this this sort of trivial color is is is

507
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,919
the key ingredients in proving a more

508
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:55,679
general statement that would be used say

509
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,720
to prove this inequality here when x and

510
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,720
y are non negative are not assumed to be

511
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,360
non- negative but I won't get into that

512
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,240
but I just make this observation that

513
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,240
would get this

514
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,760
so I claim that this thing here is also

515
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,799
absolute convergence right so again I'm

516
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,399
not assuming now a sign on these but I

517
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,399
am assuming that they're absolute

518
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,399
convergence

519
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,960
and so if they're absolutely convergent

520
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,240
so prove

521
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,240
so absolutely convergent

522
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
convergent.

523
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,200
This just means that the series here,

524
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,919
this one here

525
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,919
and this one here

526
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,960
are convergent,

527
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,039
right? That's what absolute convergence

528
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,559
mean.

529
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,559
But now if you're looking at CI,

530
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:12,320
the CI says this here is the sum here I

531
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:16,840
= 0 to N of A I sorry A I

532
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,840
B N minus I

533
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,120
okay

534
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:27,519
but this means that CI

535
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,000
absolute value here is less than

536
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,559
this thing here

537
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,559
absolute value

538
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,640
like that you can take the absolute

539
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:45,279
value sign in under the summation sign

540
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:51,760
so this is less than sum here from i = z

541
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:54,760
to n and then a i * b n minus i like

542
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,760
that

543
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,000
But now you see that this here is a this

544
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,679
here is the series. This here is the

545
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,480
corresponding

546
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,560
C. So that so you could call you could

547
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,280
now define

548
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,280
uh you could now define

549
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,919
so you start with the sequence AI

550
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,760
and I now define a a new sequence

551
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,960
bi

552
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,520
bar and I do it by just taking the

553
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,800
absolute value like that. So I know that

554
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,320
this new series is convergent. Likewise

555
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:40,560
I defined bi bar

556
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:43,760
to be the the BI absolute value

557
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,919
and I know that this is convergent

558
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,480
and then I defined a sequence here

559
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,839
CI

560
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,159
bar which is just the absolute value of

561
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,159
the CIS

562
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,200
and I know that this one here so I know

563
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,520
that

564
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,880
that this here

565
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,880
is converging that's by assumption.

566
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,240
This one here is convergent by

567
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,000
assumption.

568
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:22,240
And this inequality here proves

569
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,400
that this here that the CI bar is also

570
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,720
convergent because this one here is the

571
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,440
one where you form the products of these

572
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,480
two convergent sequences. So this one

573
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,880
here is also converting. So this here is

574
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,880
also converting

575
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,079
by the

576
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,920
okay anyway there was just an an

577
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:56,079
observation that we we're getting this

578
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,200
sort of statement out of it.

579
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,079
Okay. Now this is also related. So why

580
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,240
do we have non- negative here right or

581
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,760
why do we talk about absolute

582
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,119
convergence? So this is a simple fact

583
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,680
that if you take a serious if you're

584
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,760
trying to sum infinite numbers right we

585
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,400
now know how to sum infinite numbers. If

586
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,200
you're trying to do it

587
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,000
if the numbers that you're summing are

588
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,560
all non- negative then actually the

589
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,400
ordering doesn't matter. You can check

590
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,640
you you know you can take the fifth

591
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,520
element first and then the seventh and

592
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,079
then the 119 and then come back and take

593
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,760
one. It doesn't matter what order you do

594
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,119
it in.

595
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,320
But if the numbers are not non- negative

596
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,640
then and the and the series is not

597
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,680
absolutely convergent now it suddenly

598
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,480
matters because you could end up taking

599
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,240
all the negative numbers first and then

600
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,720
you get really really far down to you

601
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,280
know to minus towards 9 minus infinity

602
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,520
then you take a few of the positive

603
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,680
elements and then you take more of the

604
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,040
negative and so then you would actually

605
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,960
stay very far down towards minus

606
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,880
infinity

607
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,760
and and you would never be able to come

608
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,839
up again. I mean so so this is like a

609
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,400
basic fact that if you take a series

610
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,640
and the series are of non- negative

611
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,200
numbers then actually the and it's

612
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,680
converging then you can rearrange the

613
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,119
ordering and it will still converge and

614
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,720
it will still converge to the same

615
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:38,320
number. If you're trying to sum infinite

616
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,680
numbers and they are not non- negative

617
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,480
and they are don't converge absolute uh

618
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,680
and they don't converge absolutely then

619
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,800
the ordering does matter okay and this

620
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,599
is related to why we assuming that all

621
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,720
of these ai bis are non- negative

622
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,560
numbers and okay but we won't get into

623
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,240
this I mean you can read about it it's a

624
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,920
sort of standard fact it's it's

625
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,560
certainly somewhere in the book but it's

626
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,560
not Yeah.

627
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,720
>> Yeah. So I mean so it's related to

628
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,960
it's related to so so

629
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,880
I mean it's a you know again this is not

630
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,040
part of the sort of syllabus but I think

631
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,040
it's a useful thing to keep in mind

632
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,160
because it also sort of explain why

633
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,640
we're doing it in a certain way. Suppose

634
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,119
you take the the alternating harmonic

635
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,680
series, right? Remember that this thing

636
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:43,800
here, that's a harmonic series.

637
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,800
This here is is divergent,

638
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,040
right? I actually proved I I proved or

639
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,359
at least I outlined in class why this

640
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,760
series here is convergent.

641
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:01,200
And this is um okay. And it's just again

642
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,800
the idea here is that if you take so you

643
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,680
have something which is called the

644
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,760
alternating series test.

645
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,880
So this is a I'm coming back to your

646
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,440
question just a second but but but but

647
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,440
and this is closely related to that. So

648
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:22,160
the alternating series test

649
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:25,280
is that if you take a sequence a n of

650
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,440
non- negative numbers

651
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,839
and a end converts to zero.

652
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,560
Let's say that a n converts to zero

653
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:39,920
monot in a mono way. Right?

654
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:43,440
So, so an example here of this would of

655
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:47,520
course be where a in is one away right

656
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,000
these that's a mono uh sequence right so

657
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,839
if you take a mono sequence like this

658
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,320
but it doesn't need to go very fast to

659
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,520
zero this one does not convert to zero

660
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,760
very fast right but if you have that and

661
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,599
you're now looking at the alternating

662
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,599
series based on

663
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,760
This one here is convergent.

664
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,760
This one here is convergent.

665
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,720
And why is it convergent?

666
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,160
It's convergent because of the following

667
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,119
thing. And this is exactly what I did

668
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,760
you know when I when I try to explain

669
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,640
why this here is convergent

670
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,880
that you're starting somewhere let's say

671
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,160
starting at zero then you're looking at

672
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,119
the first element right if you're

673
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,400
summing here let's say you're summing

674
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,560
from one to infinity. If you're summing

675
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,640
from one, then the first element here,

676
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,800
this here is minus one. This is non

677
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,800
negative. So this is a negative number.

678
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,320
So you're going down. You're starting at

679
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,920
zero. You're going down. Right? The next

680
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,800
element

681
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,480
that will be positive because it's true

682
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,839
here. So it's positive. It will go up.

683
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,720
Right? But it's monot. So you don't go

684
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,960
as much up as you're going down. So

685
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,560
you're going first you're going down

686
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,680
then you're going up but you're going

687
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,640
less up then you're going less down then

688
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,520
you're going less up etc. And that

689
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,680
actually is forcing it to converge.

690
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Okay.

691
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,520
And so now why is this related to your

692
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,359
question about how do you reconcile

693
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,440
these? So you see like if you're looking

694
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,480
at something like this and you now took

695
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,880
all of the you know if you first took

696
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,079
many many of the of the positive

697
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,240
elements and then you know one or two of

698
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,119
the negative and then many of the

699
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,720
positive element again then actually you

700
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,200
could

701
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,440
for this series if you rearrange the

702
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,400
order of the things you're summing in

703
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,560
then you could either get it to diverge

704
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,119
or you could get it to convert to pretty

705
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:05,440
much anything you want.

706
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:08,160
Okay. So, so this hopefully explain why

707
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,520
when the series is not non- negative

708
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,240
numbers why you know the ordering really

709
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,280
matters and and again this is related to

710
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,920
very closely related to to this with the

711
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,400
product of things. Why is related?

712
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,319
Because we're getting this, you know,

713
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,319
we're getting this remainder term,

714
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,119
right? We're getting we got something

715
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,880
that was kind of like the remainder and

716
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,599
you that's the remainder that you want

717
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,319
to be small in order to say that things

718
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,359
are converging to the same thing and and

719
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,319
you wouldn't have that necessary

720
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,200
in general unless you assuming that the

721
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,200
terms were not necessary.

722
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,839
Okay, so let's come back to that was

723
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,400
just a little bit of sight

724
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,200
but I hope it makes things a bit more

725
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,400
clear. Let's come back to this theorem

726
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,560
here. How do we prove this? So we're

727
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,960
going to prove it from the theorem that

728
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:09,560
we did with that if you so we're going

729
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,560
to use this theorem we just proved

730
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,440
which is this theorem here. So we can

731
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,880
use this theorem here to prove that

732
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,760
theorem up there.

733
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:24,200
So now it's just a matter of identifying

734
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,200
the right series.

735
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,079
So right so we have so this is what we

736
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,079
want to prove.

737
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:43,280
This is what we want to show. And this

738
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,200
one here, this is the infinite sum i = 0

739
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:52,160
to infinity

740
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:55,200
x + y to the power n sorry over uh

741
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,200
uh i

742
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,079
uh

743
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:05,520
let's call it this sum from n i

744
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,920
like that. That's what what that series

745
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,200
is.

746
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:15,119
So, and this one here,

747
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:19,760
that's a sum x n

748
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:22,319
factorial. And this one here is some

749
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,760
uh y

750
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,760
uh n factorial. Right

751
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,760
now,

752
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:41,440
so I want So, if I want cn. So the idea

753
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:43,200
is that if I'm writing CN as X + Y ^ N /

754
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,119
N factorial

755
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,599
suppose I write CN like this and I write

756
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:55,359
a n

757
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:57,359
X n / n factorial and I write bn

758
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,960
y

759
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:04,480
n / n factorial. Right? Suppose I write

760
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,480
I define them like this. I already know

761
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,040
that this here is convergent and that

762
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,480
here is convergent. I by by the way of

763
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,240
course I also know that this here is

764
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,160
convergent

765
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,440
but but I now have

766
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,839
that but I don't have

767
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,440
I haven't proved

768
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:29,680
so but I claim now that this CN is

769
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:33,520
really kind of form in this way. Okay.

770
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:37,400
So let's see. So CN here if I define CN

771
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,400
to be this in here

772
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:46,480
by the binomial formula. So x + y if you

773
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:52,319
take this here to the power n

774
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:56,160
this thing here is the sum here of x i

775
00:45:52,319 --> 00:46:00,800
* y n - i

776
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:08,400
and then the coefficient is sorry

777
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:12,319
x i * y to n - y i = 0 to n and the

778
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:16,040
coefficient is n choose i. That's a

779
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,040
binomial formula.

780
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,880
Okay.

781
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:38,720
Now what is what is n choose i?

782
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:46,560
Well, n choose i.

783
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:49,200
n choose i. This is just n * n - 1 down

784
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,920
to

785
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,640
n - i

786
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,000
+ one. Right? This here gives you n

787
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,000
elements and then divided by i

788
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
factorial.

789
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Right?

790
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,880
But you can write this in here as n

791
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,319
factorial. If you do that then you

792
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:16,079
included too many. So you have to divide

793
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,880
by n minus i

794
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:23,040
factorial and then of course you still

795
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:26,160
have the i factorial in the denominator.

796
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:32,240
So you can write it like that. Okay.

797
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:36,400
So this means that the CN here our CN

798
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:43,560
is so we define CN like this X to the

799
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,560
power + Y to ^ N / N factorial

800
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,000
and if we use the binomial formula then

801
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:58,960
it was equal to that. So this here was

802
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:02,560
equal to 1 / n factorial sum i = 0 to n

803
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:08,079
x i y

804
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:12,319
n minus i and then n choose i like that.

805
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:16,960
Now I write in this little this little

806
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:18,480
equation here and so I get that 1 / n

807
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,359
factorial

808
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,520
summing from i = 0 to n and then n

809
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,240
factorial

810
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:32,720
n - i

811
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:38,079
factorial * i factorial

812
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:40,640
x to the i * y -

813
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:43,280
Okay. And now you see that the n

814
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:48,400
factorials here cancel with the n

815
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:51,040
factorials. So you're left with i

816
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,000
= 0 to n.

817
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:59,880
And now I can group it. I can group it.

818
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,880
I can write it as x i / i factorial

819
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,559
* y / n - i

820
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:14,720
factorial and this is to the power n

821
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:16,960
minus i like that.

822
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,720
But now you see that this here is

823
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,559
exactly this here is exactly when we

824
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,319
defined

825
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:32,720
uh a n like this and bn like this. This

826
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:35,040
here is exactly the sum from i = z to n

827
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,559
of a i

828
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,839
b n minus i.

829
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:47,680
Right? And so you see that what we have

830
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:52,480
is that this thing here that so so e of

831
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:55,599
x + y with our definition of the c's

832
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,920
this was just defined to be equal to

833
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,920
this limit

834
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:06,319
but but it's also the cn is also given

835
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,640
by the product of these two other series

836
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:12,160
but this means that it must be the

837
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,640
product of the two

838
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,280
like that.

839
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,280
It's product of the two sums. Infinite

840
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,280
sums

841
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,160
like that, right? But this thing here is

842
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,880
of course just

843
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:35,319
e x and this is just e y,

844
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,319
right? So this proved it, right?

845
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:41,920
Okay. And again this here I was just

846
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,119
assuming that the X and Y are non

847
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,240
negative but given what I said also this

848
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:52,079
colorary it's not very hard to prove the

849
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,319
general case from that

850
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,800
okay so now

851
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:00,480
um but I won't do that but let's so

852
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,559
let's um let's just talk about a little

853
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,079
bit more

854
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,480
about continuous functions so let me one

855
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,040
more time just remind you about it and

856
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,760
then let me give you a sort of wild

857
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,200
example of

858
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,760
of um

859
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:25,119
of a function.

860
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:27,200
Um so so so first let me remind you with

861
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,800
continuous

862
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,640
so continuous right is a really

863
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,280
important concept also in in this class.

864
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,200
So I have a function and it doesn't need

865
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,720
to be defined.

866
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,680
It's defined say on some subset of R

867
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,640
into R

868
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,040
and then we say that uh and then we have

869
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:53,280
some point X0

870
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:56,280
in the domain and we say that f here is

871
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,280
continuous

872
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,559
at X0.

873
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,559
If the following hold

874
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,440
if the following holds that for all

875
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,800
epsilon

876
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,800
for all epsilon greater than zero there

877
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,800
exist

878
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:34,000
delta greater than zero such that

879
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:38,559
If um x

880
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:44,200
is in the domain and x - x0

881
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,200
is less than delta then the images

882
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,760
deviate at most by epsilon. Okay. So

883
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,040
this is again what it's say to be

884
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,520
continuous and here unlike the previous

885
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:02,240
couple of times when I define it here

886
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,280
it's really defined you see it makes

887
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:10,000
total sense on any subset of R it

888
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,680
doesn't need to be a interval even right

889
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
doesn't need to be all of R but it

890
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,599
doesn't need to be an interval

891
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,160
um

892
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,839
yep

893
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,000
now so this is what it means means uh

894
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,760
for a function to be continuous. Let me

895
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,640
give you an example of a sort of

896
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,640
somewhat wild function.

897
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,680
Uh and

898
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,920
so continuous is a very nice property.

899
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,760
It's continuous if it's continuous at

900
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:44,800
all points. You know, usually continuous

901
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,359
is a nice property to have.

902
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,680
Often it's sort of the minimum bare

903
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,200
minimum. It's often not enough. you

904
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,200
know, you want something more than

905
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,599
continuous,

906
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59,760
but but of course other times you you

907
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,800
know,

908
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,800
you may have much less. So here's an

909
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,800
example.

910
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,640
So this is an example. So it's a

911
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,800
function. So it's a function defined on

912
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:19,480
all of R.

913
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,480
Example of a function

914
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,319
defined

915
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,760
on

916
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,720
all of R

917
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,599
that is

918
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,599
is nowhere continuous

919
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,480
by nowhere continuous I mean that it

920
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,520
that's not a single point where it's

921
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:53,119
continuous Okay.

922
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:58,960
And so this is the function f ofx

923
00:54:53,119 --> 00:55:03,200
and the function uh is uh if x here is

924
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:08,640
uh is a rational point

925
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:14,200
uh then f of x is sure and if uh if x

926
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,200
here is a irrational point

927
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:21,839
then I setting it equal to one.

928
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,240
Okay, just a pretty simple function. And

929
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:27,119
so I claim that this is not continuous

930
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:31,400
at any point.

931
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,400
And so the thing is that

932
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:42,839
see if you take any points, let's take a

933
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,839
rational points first.

934
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:52,079
So suppose here suppose you take a

935
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:55,079
rational point here. This here is x0 is

936
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,079
rational

937
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:08,240
then you have that if you are looking at

938
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,520
square root of two we know that this

939
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,760
here is this here is not rational. We

940
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,760
proved that

941
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:24,480
right. We showed that this here is not

942
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:27,520
rational. And so in fact by if you take

943
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,960
if you take uh one over sorry

944
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:34,799
square<unk> two divided by n where n

945
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,920
here is sufficiently large then you can

946
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:40,480
make this thing here very close to zero.

947
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,760
Right? So you could look at and then you

948
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:48,079
could add this thing here. So you could

949
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:54,000
look at x0 and you could look at square

950
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:56,400
root of two over n for n really large.

951
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,280
If n is really large, you can make this

952
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,599
thing here. So this is<unk> 2 plus x0,

953
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,160
right? So you can make this really

954
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,520
really close to x0.

955
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,760
This thing here would be irrational

956
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,160
and so the value of the function here

957
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,280
would be one. Okay, let's make this

958
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,280
precise a little bit more precise,

959
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,079
right? And so

960
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,960
let me maybe say just before I make it

961
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:32,240
more precise. So let let's just draw the

962
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:34,880
graph here. So we have here x0.

963
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,520
We have here this this here is this

964
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,280
irrational number which which you could

965
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,599
think about but it doesn't need to be

966
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,440
this number. It could be anything that

967
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:47,440
is irrational. This one here is

968
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:50,640
irrational. And by making n super large

969
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:54,240
right this here is super close to x0.

970
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:57,119
The value of the function here is zero.

971
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:00,839
The value of the function here

972
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,839
is is one.

973
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:07,359
Right? And so you see that you have

974
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:09,280
these points as close to this point here

975
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,319
as you want but the value of the

976
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:17,040
function is very different. Right? So so

977
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:20,040
again just to kind of spell it out

978
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,040
um

979
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,760
you know given an epsilon

980
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:37,880
you see that if epsilon here

981
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:37,880
If epsilon here was was smaller than one

982
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:48,000
then you would have that uh f ofx

983
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:53,280
minus f of x0 this here is uh a rational

984
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:57,319
point. So this here is this is zero. So

985
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,319
this is just f of x

986
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:04,799
and if this here is irrational. So if x

987
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:07,920
here is irrational

988
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:10,480
then this here is one.

989
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,520
So you would have that you would have

990
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:17,599
that you can choose this irrational

991
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:21,079
point. So for any delta

992
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,079
for any delta

993
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,280
we can choose

994
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,960
uh x which is irrational

995
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:42,319
and so that x - x0

996
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:44,559
is smaller than delta. But we have that

997
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:48,720
f of x

998
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:50,640
here is actually equal to one. And so

999
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,280
this but this difference here was

1000
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,599
supposed to be smaller than delta.

1001
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,079
That's a that it's not the case. Right?

1002
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:01,119
If I if if epsilon smaller than epsilon

1003
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,960
if epsilon is bigger smaller than one

1004
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,960
it's definitely not. It's it's one.

1005
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Right?

1006
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,839
And so similarly

1007
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:19,000
if you take so this was proving so this

1008
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:19,000
showed right. So this proof

1009
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,200
this proof

1010
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:32,280
prove that f is discontinuous

1011
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,079
at all

1012
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,079
uh rational points.

1013
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:54,160
Now let's prove that it's discontinuous

1014
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:59,880
at all irrational points. So so if

1015
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,880
x here zero is is irrational

1016
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:09,119
then we have of course that f of x0

1017
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:15,400
is equal to one. But we but but we also

1018
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:15,400
know that arbitrary close. So for any

1019
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:22,040
for any uh delta greater than zero there

1020
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,040
exist

1021
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:32,319
there exist a

1022
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:36,119
uh rational point

1023
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,119
a rational number

1024
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:43,200
x

1025
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:46,559
uh so that x - X0

1026
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:52,799
is smaller than delta. Right? But now

1027
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:55,440
again we have that f of x minus f of x0.

1028
01:01:52,799 --> 01:02:01,119
This thing here is one. This thing here

1029
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:03,440
is zero. So this difference here is one.

1030
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,920
And so you couldn't make it strictly

1031
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,200
less than one right by having this delta

1032
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:11,920
sufficient small. So this pro sort of

1033
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:16,319
same thing. It proves that the function

1034
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:21,839
is also discontinuous at all

1035
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:23,599
um at all irrational points.

1036
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:28,000
Okay.

1037
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:30,720
Now let's talk a little bit more. Right?

1038
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,480
So this is uh okay. So let's talk a

1039
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:36,640
little bit more about some of the

1040
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:38,559
algebraic rules that we we we discussed

1041
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,880
last time.

1042
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:45,880
and I wanted to single out two of them.

1043
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,880
So,

1044
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:54,160
so we had

1045
01:02:50,319 --> 01:03:00,440
so if we had the following if

1046
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,440
f and g are continuous functions

1047
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:12,040
and c

1048
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,040
is a constant.

1049
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:20,640
Then last time we talked about uh the

1050
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:22,960
following. We talked about that f plus g

1051
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,960
the sum of these two functions is also

1052
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,960
continuous.

1053
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:36,880
We talked about that if you take a

1054
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:39,920
function and you multiply by constant

1055
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,400
this is also continuous.

1056
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,880
We talked about

1057
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,720
that if you're looking at the product of

1058
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,119
these functions

1059
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,440
that's also continuous.

1060
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,920
The ones we mentioned but we didn't

1061
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,720
actually I mean you know these here was

1062
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,440
so elementary. This one here I sort of

1063
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:03,280
outline and let's talk about the last

1064
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:07,119
two properties. One is close to what we

1065
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:10,079
had for sequences and that was that if f

1066
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:12,079
here does not vanish is nowhere

1067
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:18,200
vanishing

1068
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:18,200
then one / f here is also continuous.

1069
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:23,200
And the last one which is sort of

1070
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:27,119
different from anything we had for four

1071
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:30,480
sequences is that

1072
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:34,319
um that if you take if you have now a

1073
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:37,200
function so if uh so you have these two

1074
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:40,960
functions f and g but now I'm thinking

1075
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:46,640
about f here as going from say some

1076
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:48,880
subset of r into r

1077
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:52,880
right but it may starts right by into

1078
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:56,160
some set D. This is a subset of R. This

1079
01:04:52,880 --> 01:05:02,880
is another subset of R. And then I have

1080
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:07,039
G here goes from this set into R.

1081
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:10,720
Right? It needs to be right. So you need

1082
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:14,000
this here to be defined on the images of

1083
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:16,720
F. If you have that and these two

1084
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:22,000
functions are continuous then if you

1085
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:27,359
form the if you form the composition. So

1086
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:31,720
this is g of f ofx this new function h

1087
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:31,720
here is also continuous.

1088
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,880
Okay.

1089
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:48,240
And so I want to in a few remaining

1090
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:51,480
minutes uh I want to talk about uh these

1091
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,480
two properties

1092
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,720
and I I will start with the last one

1093
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:01,839
because that's somewhat different from

1094
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:07,400
stuff we tal about last time.

1095
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:07,400
I mean for for for uh for sequences

1096
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,839
So let's try to prove that this

1097
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,839
composition here is continuous.

1098
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,599
So proof of five.

1099
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:34,760
So given epsilon

1100
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,079
given epsilon right well we know that

1101
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:45,680
the function so you sort of have to

1102
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:50,000
start backwards given epsilon you know

1103
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:52,319
right sorry uh let's before I take given

1104
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,280
let me just say that I want to prove it

1105
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:56,280
let's show

1106
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,880
that um that h which is a composition is

1107
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,880
continuous

1108
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:16,000
at x0. Okay.

1109
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:19,200
And and uh so I want to prove that and

1110
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,920
for for for convenience I'm just going

1111
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:26,799
to call the image of x0 under f and

1112
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,440
we'll call that y.

1113
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:33,720
Okay.

1114
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,720
So now given epsilon

1115
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:43,039
given epsilon bigger than zero.

1116
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:48,599
There uh since

1117
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:48,599
since uh g is continuous

1118
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,599
at y zeote

1119
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,760
that this is

1120
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:04,599
this is y z. So since G is continuous at

1121
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,599
Y Z there exist

1122
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:17,520
at delta let's call it delta G.

1123
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:21,839
So that if y - y0

1124
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:24,839
if this is less than delta g then there

1125
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,839
images

1126
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:32,880
sorry on the g

1127
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:37,759
f but on the g.

1128
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:41,359
So then their images g of y

1129
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:44,880
minus g of y0

1130
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:47,880
the images under g is smaller than

1131
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,880
epsilon.

1132
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,480
Okay.

1133
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,600
So this is just because g is continuous

1134
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,600
and I'm using that it's continuous at y

1135
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,600
z.

1136
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:07,040
Now I kn need to use that f is

1137
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:10,279
continuous.

1138
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,279
So now

1139
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:22,440
so now I'm thinking about this delta G

1140
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:22,440
as my epsilon that in F right so from

1141
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,880
from delta G

1142
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,319
and

1143
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,319
the continuity

1144
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:42,520
Okay.

1145
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:42,520
Uh there exist

1146
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:55,679
there exist uh

1147
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,679
there exist um delta

1148
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:01,080
of f

1149
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,080
such that

1150
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:12,480
if x - x0

1151
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:14,480
is less than delta of f then the images

1152
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:19,199
f ofx

1153
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:21,760
minus f of x0 the images is less than

1154
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:23,760
delta g

1155
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:28,080
right

1156
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:35,480
but now you see now I have this thing

1157
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:35,480
here f ofx this thing here this is f ofx

1158
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:43,280
uh and this thing here

1159
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:47,000
f of x0 was y z right so this is the

1160
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,000
same as this

1161
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:53,520
but now you see that so that I have

1162
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,920
these two points that they are and where

1163
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,880
one of them is y zero and then I have

1164
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,239
this other point and their difference is

1165
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,840
bounded by delta

1166
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,920
g

1167
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,000
so I'm in this iteration

1168
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,239
So it means that the images of these

1169
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,880
two. So this imply that the images of

1170
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:19,679
this thing here under G and this here on

1171
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:24,000
G. So G of F of X

1172
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:28,000
minus G of F

1173
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:32,320
sorry G of Y zero.

1174
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,880
This thing here is less than epsilon,

1175
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,120
right?

1176
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,320
This is just because I that was how

1177
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:43,440
delta G was chosen, right? And you see

1178
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:45,840
that one of them one of these two points

1179
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:49,360
have to be y zero. But that's exactly

1180
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:52,480
what it is over there.

1181
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,640
So I have this but you see this thing

1182
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:59,320
here

1183
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,320
but but this thing here is just

1184
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:12,400
But you see that f g of f ofx

1185
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,480
this is just the composition. So this is

1186
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:18,000
what we call h of x

1187
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:23,840
g

1188
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:28,560
of y 0. Well y z was

1189
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:32,159
defined to be f of x0. Right? So this

1190
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:34,640
thing here is g

1191
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:37,840
of f of x0

1192
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:41,600
but that's just a composition

1193
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:46,360
at x0. So you see what we have now is

1194
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,360
that so so therefore we have

1195
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:53,040
that if x - x0

1196
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,920
if this thing here is less than this

1197
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,239
delta f

1198
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,120
then we have

1199
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:05,600
we have this thing here right but this

1200
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:09,520
thing here is h of x

1201
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,760
minus h of x0 Z

1202
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:14,080
is less than epsilon.

1203
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,800
Right? And so this prove that the

1204
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:20,480
composition of these two function is

1205
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,960
continuous. Right? And so again when you

1206
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,280
have when you have two function and you

1207
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,920
look at the composition, it's really

1208
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:31,520
important to first check

1209
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:34,239
that the second one is defined. So the

1210
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:38,400
second one should be defined

1211
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:40,000
where you end up under the first map.

1212
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:43,000
Right?

1213
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
So

1214
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,800
okay. So now

1215
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,960
um

1216
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,960
so now let me just say a few words about

1217
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,920
the other one

1218
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:01,120
number four.

1219
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:03,760
But that's the number four is closer to

1220
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:06,760
things we had for

1221
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,760
for

1222
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:15,239
the sequences. So you so we are now pro

1223
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,239
of four.

1224
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,360
So what we have is we have this

1225
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,679
function.

1226
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:29,040
It's never zero

1227
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:29,040
and we have some x0 in the domain.

1228
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,360
And we know that f here is continuous.

1229
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:45,159
We only need it to be continuous at x0.

1230
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,159
And then I want to show

1231
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,040
that 1 / f ofx is continuous.

1232
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:09,400
And so I'm looking at um so I want to

1233
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:09,400
estimate this difference here

1234
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:18,000
and I want to say that I if I pick an

1235
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:22,159
epsilon then I can pick X as close if if

1236
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:25,280
I pick X to be within delta but delta

1237
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:26,960
sufficiently small of x0 then this

1238
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,800
difference here can be smaller than

1239
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,880
epsilon.

1240
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:34,560
So now just let me just estimate this

1241
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,920
thing here

1242
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,320
and so this thing here is just by so now

1243
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:45,440
I just put it on the common denominator.

1244
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:49,840
So I have f of x0 minus f ofx

1245
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:54,040
divided by f of x0

1246
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,040
uh f of x

1247
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:01,840
right and now it's sort of the usual

1248
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:04,719
problem but but now we we maybe not so

1249
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:08,480
worried about that usual problem the

1250
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:10,719
usual problem is this s x x0 is fixed so

1251
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,800
this is just some number. So that

1252
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,960
doesn't really matter too much. This one

1253
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:18,000
here is not fixed, right? But so that's

1254
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:21,120
a usual problem. I mean this is problem

1255
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,120
we've seen before. We saw it in three up

1256
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:26,960
there and we saw it in the similar

1257
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:30,960
things for sequences.

1258
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:33,360
But now the thing is that

1259
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:37,199
that since

1260
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:40,480
since uh

1261
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:44,440
f of x0

1262
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,440
is not equal to zero

1263
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:51,679
then you can just take so then now you

1264
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:54,320
can first take so we're going to uh

1265
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:59,440
right so now we just going to we we're

1266
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:04,000
going to pick the delta in uh in uh the

1267
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:06,080
delta we want in in two in two steps the

1268
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,800
first step is since this here is not

1269
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:11,800
zero then we know that they exist

1270
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:20,640
at delta 1 greater than zero. So that if

1271
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,880
x - x0

1272
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:30,719
is smaller than delta 1, then the image

1273
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:37,400
between f of x and f of x0. I can make

1274
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:37,400
that smaller than f of x0.

1275
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:44,000
over two. Right? You see I'm just using

1276
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:48,400
this one here first as my epsilon.

1277
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:53,199
Right? Once I have that, but this here

1278
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:58,159
implies of course that f ofx

1279
01:17:53,199 --> 01:18:00,960
see I have f ofx in the denominator

1280
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:04,400
and I want to bound this here from

1281
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:07,040
above. Right? Right. I want to bound it

1282
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:10,719
from above. So I just need to get a

1283
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:13,199
lower bound for f ofx. Right? So f ofx

1284
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:16,640
here.

1285
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:19,040
So I have that f ofx

1286
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:23,679
uh plus

1287
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:29,480
um I can write sorry I can write um

1288
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:29,480
using this I can write f of x0

1289
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:38,120
as uh f of x

1290
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,120
minus

1291
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:46,080
uh sorry f of x0

1292
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,640
like this minus f ofx

1293
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:51,880
plus f of x right obviously I can write

1294
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,880
like that

1295
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:59,199
and so this means that f of x0

1296
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:03,520
taking slabbing absolute value sign on

1297
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:06,719
it this here is less than f of x0

1298
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:10,080
- f ofx

1299
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:12,640
plus f ofx,

1300
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:16,159
right? And so now I can move this one

1301
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:19,159
here over on the other side. So I have

1302
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:19,159
that.

1303
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:26,400
So I have that. So if I move this one

1304
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,800
here over on the other side, I get that

1305
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:32,080
f ofx

1306
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,080
absolute value is bigger or equal to f

1307
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:37,280
of x0

1308
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:40,280
absolute value minus this difference

1309
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,280
here

1310
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,199
like that. Right?

1311
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,520
But if I make x and x0 delta one close

1312
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:54,320
to each other, then this difference here

1313
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,400
is at, you know, it's actually less than

1314
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:59,520
this thing here. So there's still

1315
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:02,480
another half. You see this one here must

1316
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,000
be bigger equal to

1317
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:07,719
12

1318
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,719
of f of x0,

1319
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,400
right? Because this here takes up

1320
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,560
strictly less than half of this thing

1321
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:18,239
here. So there's still another half

1322
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,000
left. Okay. And so this give us a lower

1323
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:22,400
bound for this. And now we're out of

1324
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,400
time, but this give us a lower bound for

1325
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:29,600
this as long as we make sure that X and

1326
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:31,199
X0 is delta one close. And once you have

1327
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,159
then you can just treat this here as a

1328
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:38,239
constant. And so now it's clear that you

1329
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:40,480
then make another choice of of delta

1330
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:43,679
possibly even smaller than the one this

1331
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:45,679
one here. And then for this smallest of

1332
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:48,080
these two numbers then you can now

1333
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:52,360
conclude that this fraction here is

1334
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,360
smaller than epsilon. Okay.

1335
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,960
Any questions?

1336
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,880
>> Yeah. Um, I have a question going back

1337
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,640
to what we're talking about.

1338
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,320
>> I was a little bit confused because like

1339
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,440
we're defining it to be like non

1340
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,520
continuous

1341
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,640
>> but like by definition of continuity

1342
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,400
like if you had if you picked some um

1343
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,440
like two x's near each other that were

1344
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,080
both rational.

1345
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,640
>> Yeah.

1346
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,400
>> Like and f of x is both zero then

1347
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:18,560
wouldn't that be continuous?

1348
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,960
>> Right. So, so the first of all, let me

1349
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,040
say that if you were to picture this

1350
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,719
function, right? I mean, of course, it

1351
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,800
wouldn't be very easy to picture it, but

1352
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:29,040
but you would sort of if you were to

1353
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,040
draw it, right? Then actually, it would

1354
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,280
look it wouldn't look like a function

1355
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:36,080
anymore because like you would have it

1356
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:38,239
on all the rational numbers here, it

1357
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,400
would be zero. On all the irrational

1358
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:42,080
numbers here, it would be one. So, if

1359
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,760
you picture it, it would look like two

1360
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:46,480
lines. But of course it wouldn't be two

1361
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,080
lines because it's right but the points

1362
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,320
are just so close together that you

1363
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:53,199
couldn't really draw it right. And so

1364
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:56,320
the thing is that but it also means that

1365
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:59,760
if you this picture here illustrate what

1366
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:02,480
you're saying that for if you take here

1367
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,880
if you take a rational numbers well all

1368
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,560
the rational numbers that is really you

1369
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,880
know any rational number whether it's

1370
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:12,719
close or not it will all be zero on

1371
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:16,000
those. So that's not where the problem

1372
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:18,560
with continuity occur. The problem occur

1373
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,199
because you also have irrational numbers

1374
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:24,239
close to it and it has to be for all

1375
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:26,400
points close to this that it the value

1376
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:29,120
had to be almost the same. Right? So

1377
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:32,560
it's really for the irrational numbers

1378
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,960
that the problem occur with continuity

1379
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,280
in a rational numbers and vice versa.

1380
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,800
for an irrational number. If you're

1381
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,880
looking at continuity around an

1382
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,880
irrational number, the problem is not

1383
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:46,760
from other irrational numbers, but it's

1384
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,760
from the rational numbers.
