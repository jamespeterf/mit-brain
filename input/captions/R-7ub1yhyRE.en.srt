00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,759
Today we'll be diving into some of the

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,280
most exciting research happening at MIT

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,680
material sciences. how new understanding

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,640
of structural processes at the nano

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,000
scale allows to control structure and

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,240
function at the micros macro scale and

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,920
how that understanding

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,079
can lead to new performance materials.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
So we'll be hearing about several use

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,040
cases which demonstrate the strength of

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,680
this bottomup approach in solving

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
industrial problems. We're going to have

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,120
three presentations. Each presentation

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,520
is 35 minutes. So it's relatively short.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,800
Um but I asked each presenter to leave a

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,399
couple of minutes at the end for

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,440
questions.

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,760
Um unfortunately we only can do

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,160
questions for the live audience here.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,719
Those who are following us virtually

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,520
can't ask unfortunately

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,240
but um I'll make sure to repeat the

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,640
question so it will be heard by those

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
who follow us who follow the live

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,520
stream.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,320
Um, we'll wrap up at 1 p.m. and go for

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,320
lunch.
