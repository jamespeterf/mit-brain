00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,960
Hello.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,200
Uh, my name is Andrew Dorne and I'm here

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,440
today to talk about Nominal, the future

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,440
of test.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,640
Um, I'm head of engineering at Nominal

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,199
and uh, class of uh, 2014 here at MIT.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,480
Um, we're fortunate to have uh, two MIT

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,720
co-founders uh, Cameron and Jason. Um at

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,679
nominal we're building the connected

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,279
suite of software for hardware test and

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,559
validation.

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,360
Um we're fortunate to have built a team

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,399
of a hundred of the best operators um

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,000
from across the world um from the likes

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,800
of Loheed Martin and Applied Intuition

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,360
and Palunteer. Um and we're backed by

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,800
some of the best investors. Um, we've

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
been fortunate enough to partner with

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,559
some of the best engineering teams

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,559
across both commercial and the DoD.

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,719
At Nominal, we believe that test and

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,840
validation are the critical bottlenecks

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,000
of hardware. Test velocity defines

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,720
program timelines, manufacturing

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,600
capacity, and operational performance.

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
And today's best hardware teams test

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,320
early and often with real-time

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,640
automation, rapid field validation

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,640
across development, production, and

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,240
operations.

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
And we also believe that the future of

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,880
hardware test is connected. Engineers

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
want to be thinking about paradigms

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,880
exactly the same throughout the entire

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
operational life cycle of hardware test

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
and development from manufacturing

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,920
integration test system test field test

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,159
and validation and finally live

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,280
operations and with nominal you can do

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
this all in one centralized place.

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
The current software stack for hardware

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,720
test is fragmented and isolated.

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
Engineers burn hours upon hours merging

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,880
files, trying to correlate logs, and

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
running one-off scripts that often they

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,479
didn't even write. Ultimately,

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,719
ultimately resulting in delayed

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,000
milestones, cost overruns, and

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,640
unreliable results. With Nominal, you

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
have a unified software stack across our

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,120
two main products, Nominal Core and

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Nominal Connect. It is truly the modern

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,440
tool chain for real world engineering.

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,760
Nominal core is our unified multimodal

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,560
cloud-based offering for high-scale

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,640
data, real-time operations, operational

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,760
procedures, and asset management.

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,959
Enominal connect is our edge-based test

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,200
stand focused uh product around command

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,239
and control as well as syncing data back

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,239
to the cloud back to core. I want to

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
talk through an example use case of

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,800
nominal in the field with one of our

64
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,400
partners, Hermus. Hermes is trying to

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,920
build a hypersonic aircraft, the uh Mach

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,000
1. They go, they fly the test. Uh they

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,120
want to upload the data into nominal VR

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
APIs. They're able to easily generate

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,239
and automate templatized analysis VR

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,879
workbooks. And they are also able to

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,120
collaborative collaboratively identify

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,680
test points and anomalies with their

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,000
teammates ultimately leading to faster

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
triage of results with the ability to

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
modify the system more quickly and then

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,959
go test again.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,360
We found that with nominal uh the Hermes

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,760
engineers were 80% faster going from

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
data generation to data analysis

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,400
enabling their first flight in just

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,560
seven months and the CEO of Her Hermes

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,519
thought that this was a critical part of

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,680
their hardware development life cycle.

84
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,599
Finally, if you're developing,

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,840
manufacturing, testing, deploying, or

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,840
operating complex hardware, please reach

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,799
out. We're working across a variety of

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,879
industries, aerospace, defense, autonomy

89
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,640
to name a few. Again, my name is Andrew

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,120
Dorne. I'm here with my partners, Wesley

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,920
Gao. Uh, please reach out. We'd love to

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,920
talk. Thank you.
