1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,440
okay so good

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,760
morning we're still uh playing with

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,960
mixtures properties of multicomponent

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,280
systems and

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:38,360
um we've done we've defined

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:42,520
uh some ideal Behavior like the Gibs

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:47,160
Dalton mixture that applies for ideal

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:50,520
gases and today we'll extend that to the

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,120
case of liquid

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,039
mixtures remember this we was last uh

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,920
last slide of the last

12
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,920
lecture and we were discussing this uh

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,799
Leonard Jon's

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,119
interactions between

15
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:16,159
particles and remember that in the gas

16
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:19,600
phase when we can apply the ideal gas

17
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:24,119
model the

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,159
particles uh on average leave far away

19
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,720
from each

20
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,159
other they do experience the Collision

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,240
uh very often and so very often they do

22
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,040
experience this acceleration towards the

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,479
other particle and then the the uh

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:47,040
repulsion that pushes it back and then

25
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:50,399
finishes the uh the Collision but uh uh

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,920
the time that they spend in this area is

27
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,240
much smaller than the time they spend

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,399
far away from each other and therefore

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,360
uh for the calculation of the average

30
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,360
properties at stable

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,360
equilibrium

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,959
uh each particle is behaves as if it

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,720
work by

34
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,760
itself and in fact that's the behavior

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,760
that we have observed also for

36
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:25,599
mixtures and uh so also for mixtures

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,440
whether the particles are closed to

38
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,599
similar particles or to different

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:37,920
particles uh if we are in the Gibbs

40
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,920
Dalton mixture uh

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,879
limit the same holds also for different

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,640
particles but you can see that if there

43
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:54,040
are uh mixtures in which for

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,959
example uh the individual components

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,840
when

46
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,120
pure uh stay far from each other but

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,760
when mixed like to stay

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,879
close in that case you would have a non

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,680
ideal

50
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:14,400
Behavior because if they spend more time

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:17,519
in this uh close by area then uh this

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,920
will influence and you cannot neglect

53
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,799
anymore this energy of

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,400
interaction okay now

55
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,200
similar

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,840
to uh the Gibs Dalton mixture Behavior

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,080
we can Define also an ideal solution

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,319
behavior for the liquid

59
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,360
phase like sketched here so in the

60
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:46,239
liquid of course the particles live very

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,239
close to one another and so they live

62
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,640
very close to this dip in the um Leonard

63
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,280
John's

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,439
potential

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:04,159
but we can consider an ideal situation

66
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:08,079
uh hypothetical of course uh but it's a

67
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,000
good start for any kind of modeling

68
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,920
uh uh or it could be also taken it's

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,919
actually taken typically as a reference

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:23,360
and then we we

71
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:25,880
will describe U uh actual real solution

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,160
Behavior as uh

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,639
departures uh with respect to the ideal

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,440
solution Behavior okay this ideal

75
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,440
solution behavior is one in

76
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,720
which

77
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,680
um this effect of the energy of

78
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,360
interaction is

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,720
alike for the particles for the say for

80
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,639
the a particles and for the B particles

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,880
and it's also alike for the A and B

82
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,400
particles so essentially these particles

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,800
are very similar to one another

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,639
and they don't really care if the

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
neighbor is similar or

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,160
not and that in that limit therefore

87
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,960
there is no

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,199
contribution to um the enthalpy of

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,080
mixing because you remember the enthalpy

90
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,800
of mixing has to do with the fact that

91
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,319
for example here if you if I take a um a

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,400
gray particle and I put it in a in a a

93
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,720
container full of black

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,919
particles uh the enthalpy of of mixing

95
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,560
is the change in the

96
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:49,680
energy uh if I keep the same temperature

97
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:53,400
and pressure uh due to uh mixing adding

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,639
one mole of that gray substance into the

99
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,120
black uh uh

100
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:03,280
bulk and um so

101
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,560
if the if the if the particle lives in

102
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,319
this

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,280
area the enthalpy of mixing will be

104
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:15,280
related to this uh deep in the

105
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,280
energy

106
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,400
uh now this other uh case for the liquid

107
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,759
case we are somewhere here so so the the

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,120
energy somewhere here but it's the same

109
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,160
for all and

110
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,120
so uh

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,800
even if you add uh one more gray

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,160
particle it doesn't really make a

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,840
difference for the energy it doesn't

114
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,919
really make a difference for the volume

115
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,720
also because being at the same living at

116
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,520
the same distance the volume also

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,039
doesn't change for the mixture but it

118
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,800
does make sense I mean

119
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:59,599
make a

120
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,360
difference uh regarding the entropy

121
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,000
because as you uh remember uh when we

122
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,039
did this entropy of mixing uh

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,120
idea um the fact that

124
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,960
uh you have added one more gray particle

125
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,280
you have

126
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,919
diluted uh the

127
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,360
mixture so you have

128
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:26,560
changed say what we call the uh the

129
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,080
surprise when you see a gray molecule

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,639
now you've changed the probability of

131
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,479
seeing the gray molecule uh with respect

132
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,440
to the to the to the black one and that

133
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,560
is accounted for by the entropy of

134
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,800
mixing that's

135
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,919
why the entropy of mixing does is the

136
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,080
only effect so in this ideal solution

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,520
Behavior we only have this uh entropy of

138
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,520
mixing

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,639
effect now if you remember uh the

140
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,319
chemical

141
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,639
potential

142
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,639
for any

143
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,639
constituent was written this way as the

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
chemical potential of the pure component

145
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
at the same temperature and pressure of

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,960
the

147
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,560
mixture plus the enthalpy of mixing of

148
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,400
that component minus the temperature

149
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,879
times the entropy of mixing and we've

150
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,519
use this relation already a few

151
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,519
times so if I

152
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,839
substitute the three assumptions up

153
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,240
here all right so let me do first the

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,480
volume okay for the volume I have to

155
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,800
remember that the volume of the mixture

156
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,120
is given as we have proven by in general

157
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,560
as a weight at sum of the partial

158
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,360
volumes of the constituents in the

159
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,200
mixture and the partial volume volumes

160
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,760
can be written as the specific volume of

161
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,399
the pure component at the same

162
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,079
temperature and pressure of the mixture

163
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:13,959
plus the volume of mixing so in in this

164
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:16,720
case the volume of mixing is assumed to

165
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:20,399
be zero for the ideal solution

166
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,200
behavior and so all we are left is that

167
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,360
the volume is given by the weighted sum

168
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,000
of the volumes that the single pure

169
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,959
components would occupy at the same

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,360
temperature and pressure and this is

171
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,360
amagat law of additive

172
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,920
volumes something that we Pro we we

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,279
proved this satisfied also by a Gibs

174
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,279
Delton mixture of Ideal

175
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,920
gases for the chemical

176
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,640
potential so Delta X mix oh yeah here

177
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,519
there should be an equal

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,560
zero I thought I corrected this all

179
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:05,279
right uh so equal Z and equal Z

180
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,560
so Delta x uh Delta H is equal to zero

181
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,760
and Delta s is equal to minus r log of Y

182
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,200
which is the surprise multiplied by the

183
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,279
bolman

184
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,800
constant or the gas constant H so the

185
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:22,560
minus and the minus become plus and so

186
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,040
the chemical potential becomes plus RT

187
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
log of

188
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,480
Y at this

189
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:36,079
stage a the solution behavior is when

190
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,079
this happens for all uh

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,079
constituents and this is a very rare

192
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,560
practical situation but again it's a

193
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:51,000
good starting point a good reference uh

194
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,000
situation on which you can make some

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
calculations

196
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,240
now this ideal uh mix

197
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,920
solution Behavior can be used to derive

198
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,920
uh an

199
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,480
important aspect of equilibria across

200
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,920
semi-permeable membranes which is the

201
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,680
osmotic

202
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,600
pressure

203
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,839
concept and osmotic

204
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,760
pressure was nothing by about the

205
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,160
difference between the pressure of the

206
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,440
mixture and the pressure that the pure

207
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,040
component has when in mutual equilibrium

208
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,440
on the other side of a

209
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,440
membrane that is permeable only to that

210
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:48,279
component so it's p minus Pi I

211
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,279
I

212
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,320
and

213
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,800
now the expression that I just uh uh

214
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,720
reminded us uh uh on the other slide

215
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,800
just

216
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,600
uh just behind this uh is uh is

217
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,360
Rewritten

218
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:16,880
here by remembering that

219
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,880
U of course across that

220
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,120
membrane there is a equilibrium Mutual

221
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,199
equilibrium and the condition for Mutual

222
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
equilibrium is that the chemical

223
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,680
potential of the constituent in the

224
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,480
mixture is equal to the uh chemical

225
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,279
potential of the pure

226
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,680
constituent uh on the other side of the

227
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,560
membrane so up here where the pressure

228
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,240
is the partial

229
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,240
pressure so

230
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,519
this and also here I see um another

231
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,639
error to be corrected on the slides this

232
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,639
would be double I here and double I

233
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,040
here um so this is equal to the this is

234
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:03,320
the chemical potential this is equal to

235
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,600
the chemical potential of the

236
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,600
constituent in the

237
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,240
mixture uh but it is equal to the pure

238
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:17,040
chemical potential at the partial

239
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,839
pressure so as you remember when you we

240
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,839
calculate this uh difference

241
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,560
since uh we know that the the derivative

242
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,120
of chemical potential with respect to

243
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,120
pressure is the is a specific volume

244
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,920
this integral can be easily done once we

245
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,320
know the equation of state of the

246
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,040
substance of the pure

247
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:46,480
substance

248
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:50,720
okay so this is nothing uh new but it's

249
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,759
the starting point of this observation

250
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,639
made by Ian

251
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:59,800
Toof namely that when

252
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,680
uh we have a solution

253
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,839
and we have a dilute solution so a

254
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,199
dilute solution means that there is a

255
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,320
lot of a substance think of say a lot of

256
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:14,560
gray

257
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:17,160
particles and a few solutes so the one

258
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,000
is called the solvent and the other the

259
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,759
others are called the

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,320
solutes and the solvent is the

261
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,440
predominant

262
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:31,199
amount so that means that the mole

263
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,399
fraction of the Sol is very close to

264
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,560
one and one

265
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,279
minus the mole fraction of the solvent

266
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,600
which is equal to the sum of the mo

267
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,759
fractions of the

268
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,680
solutes is much less than one so that is

269
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:52,079
a dilute

270
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,959
solution now in a dilute

271
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,600
solution

272
00:14:53,959 --> 00:15:00,759
um if you put in

273
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,079
a um a gray

274
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,959
particle in the Box in which there are

275
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,959
already many many gray

276
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,079
particles it's very likely that that

277
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,199
particle will end up with neighbors that

278
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,720
are

279
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:21,240
gray so in this

280
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,560
situation there is no enthalpy of mixing

281
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,600
there is no change in volume of mixing

282
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,839
so it's exactly the kind of behavior

283
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,560
that uh describes the ideal solution

284
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,839
behavior for the solvent only

285
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:40,680
though so what we are saying is that of

286
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,000
one tough observations is that in any

287
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,399
dilute

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,519
solution even if we are not in that

289
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,360
limiting situation in which the blue I

290
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,639
mean the the dark and and gray

291
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,839
particles um are

292
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,399
identical in terms of interact

293
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,639
intermolecular

294
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,480
interactions uh even they're very

295
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:07,279
different but the fact that there are

296
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:12,440
few uh black particles makes the makes

297
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:16,240
that the addition of a gray one doesn't

298
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,040
doesn't change the uh the the energy and

299
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,959
the volume of of the mixture so in other

300
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,079
words the solvent of a dilute solution

301
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,079
behaves according to the ideal solution

302
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,079
model

303
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,519
and of

304
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,880
course that doesn't mean that there is

305
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,000
no effect in adding the gray particle

306
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,639
because again if we add the gray

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,959
particle it it is going to

308
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:54,720
dilute further uh the solution and that

309
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,160
will have an effect on the entropy of

310
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
mixing for example if you take the

311
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,120
entropy of mixing here which is that

312
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,959
expression that we derived and

313
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,199
you write

314
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:12,160
it for this solution

315
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:17,360
here um see the reason I want to write

316
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,039
it carefully is that U I want to compute

317
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,720
the entropy of mixing and that is that

318
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,679
the derivative of

319
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,199
s not with respect to the mole fractions

320
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,840
but with respect to the amount or

321
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,720
consitent I one which is the

322
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,360
solvent and so I have to uh M write

323
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,280
explicitly how the mole fractions depend

324
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,360
on the amount and you see uh there is an

325
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,559
N1 in the numerator but there is also an

326
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,360
N1 in the denominator so when you take

327
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:52,640
the derivative you have to be

328
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,159
careful and so uh well if you do

329
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,880
it it turns

330
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:03,000
out that the change in this entropy of

331
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:07,000
of mixing by due to the addition of a

332
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:13,039
small amount of N1 is indeed equal to

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,039
minus r log of Y and that is the

334
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:24,159
surprise so this backs up V's

335
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,080
observation so at least for the solvent

336
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,360
we can use

337
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,240
um the ideal

338
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,039
the ideal mixture

339
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:41,320
uh solution so we can set Delta H equal

340
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:44,559
to zero here and Delta s mix equals to

341
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:49,919
minus r log of Y so this becomes a plus

342
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,919
RT log of Y and here it

343
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,559
is and for the other side you see this

344
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,000
integral now if we apply it to a liquid

345
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,080
so if we talking about out a dilute

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,320
liquid

347
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,880
solution the specific volume of a liquid

348
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,120
under the

349
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,320
incompressible

350
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,840
ideal uh fluid is is constant doesn't

351
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,760
change with temperature and pressure so

352
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,360
this V goes out of the integral and it

353
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,400
becomes

354
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:28,720
um the specific volume of the solvent

355
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,679
times the difference in the in

356
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,280
integration limits and that's the

357
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,799
osmotic

358
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,760
pressure so we got the expression here

359
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,679
for the osmotic

360
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,640
pressure uh actually van makes an

361
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,080
additional

362
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,600
approximation noticing that

363
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,000
since

364
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:53,480
the the assumption is that the solution

365
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,320
is dilute it means that uh the mole

366
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,159
fraction of solute is very close to one

367
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,039
so we can write it as one minus the mole

368
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:04,400
fractions of the solutes

369
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:07,360
and uh and then we can take the first uh

370
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,919
term in the tayor series expansion of

371
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:16,159
log of one minus X which is minus

372
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:19,640
X so this becomes

373
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,159
simply uh the summation of the solutes

374
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,320
and finally we we have this expression

375
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,000
which is the V relation says the osmotic

376
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,000
pressure of the

377
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,000
solvent is equal to RT divided by the

378
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,799
specific volume and again here this

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,919
should be a

380
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:40,240
v11 another

381
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,520
error uh um

382
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,679
times the mole the sum of the mole

383
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,000
fractions of the

384
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,720
solutes notice that it doesn't really

385
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
matter what the solutes are can be any

386
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:58,080
molecule could be sugar could be uh

387
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,400
chlorine and so on could be salt except

388
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,280
that U

389
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,159
as we will see in a moment because that

390
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,039
is the uh important application that we

391
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,200
want to

392
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:14,159
discuss as you know some molecules for

393
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,080
example salt when you put it in water

394
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,440
they separate they dissociate and then

395
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,120
they get solvated they

396
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,039
hydroly and uh and

397
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,200
so

398
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,039
uh you have to be careful when counting

399
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,600
the

400
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,559
molecules because when you have uh for

401
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:42,240
example uh the mole you put in a certain

402
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:42,240
fraction of of salt and then you um

403
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,440
uh

404
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,799
um it gets dissolved for each mole that

405
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:55,840
you put in you get two moles of

406
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,840
solutes so you have to double

407
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,520
this now

408
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:08,200
clearly this issue of uh uh osmotic

409
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,600
pressures is important in biology and as

410
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:15,320
I told you several times I no expert in

411
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,200
biology so I don't want to talk about it

412
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,159
because um it's too risky to say wrong

413
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:25,960
things but I can point you to a nice

414
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:29,360
YouTube um lecture where you can learn

415
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:33,520
about osmosis in biology

416
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,120
and it tells you how cells uh

417
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,200
um receive

418
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,360
exchange across the

419
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:45,960
membrane um molecules depending on

420
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:48,440
whether uh there is a the chemical

421
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,080
potential is if there is equality of

422
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,440
chemical potential of course you're in

423
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,120
equilibrium but if the concentration are

424
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,120
are are different than those that you

425
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,000
are at equilibrium then depending on the

426
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,559
sign of the difference in the chemical

427
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,159
potential you can have a a flow in One

428
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,279
Direction or the other and that is

429
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,440
helpful in uh regulating the metabolism

430
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:15,720
of the

431
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:18,039
cell and in this video you also are uh

432
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,120
brought to understand what the

433
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:23,880
difference between plant uh membranes of

434
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,159
plant cells and animal cells are they

435
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:33,080
are kind of different and they um they

436
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,520
behave behave in different uh ways in

437
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,159
the plants they can sustain more

438
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:43,200
pressure in the animal cells they are

439
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,200
more fragile so to speak and they can

440
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,440
break there are also uh important uh

441
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,120
applications

442
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,400
in chemical engineering for

443
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,039
example recently of course there is this

444
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,880
um U big uh

445
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,000
topic

446
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,000
of developing lithium ion

447
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
batteries

448
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:16,279
and here you have um this lithium

449
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,880
ion molecules these

450
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:24,919
pinkish molecule that

451
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:27,320
are um in dilute Solutions of solvents

452
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,799
and these solvents for example in this

453
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,799
case are some kinds of

454
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,039
carbonates so the osmotic

455
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,880
pressure of course you are if you are at

456
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:45,600
the osmotic pressure you you are in

457
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:49,919
equilibrium and nothing moves on average

458
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,240
but uh if you do not have the same the

459
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,640
concentrations that deliver the osmotic

460
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:00,000
pressure then you can have osmosis which

461
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,919
is the movement of the ey ions uh in

462
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,320
search

463
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,320
to better

464
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,399
equilibrium so let's uh talk about

465
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,600
seawater as the example as you

466
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:19,279
know

467
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:24,080
seawater on average per kilogram of sea

468
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:27,000
water has 35 grams of uh

469
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:32,120
salt and of

470
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,760
course there is this um fact that

471
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,720
the the salt dissociates and so you get

472
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,279
ions

473
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:45,159
of sodium and I ions of chorine chlorine

474
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:48,000
that gets hydrated meaning that the

475
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:51,120
molecules of water which are polar get

476
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,200
attracted attracted from one side the

477
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:58,399
oxygen side is negative so it's

478
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,480
attracted by uh the by the sodium which

479
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:04,240
is a

480
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:09,000
positive charge and the hydrogen side is

481
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:13,799
is is positive and is attracted by um

482
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,520
the chlorine ion and so uh you get

483
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:23,039
this molecules typically around six

484
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,320
molecules on average are around each

485
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,840
ion however not

486
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,919
all

487
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,120
um uh

488
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:35,840
ions get so far apart sometimes they get

489
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,080
also they form ion pairs in other words

490
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,159
they they they also attract still

491
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,799
attract each other and they are still

492
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:49,960
also surrounded by water

493
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:51,320
molecules so suppose we apply the vof

494
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,279
equation by

495
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,080
neglecting these ion

496
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:01,600
Pairs and

497
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,600
assuming that uh 100% % of the

498
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,240
salt goes into into this hydrated ions

499
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,640
forms so that means that now I have to

500
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,159
do the the counting in order to see how

501
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:23,039
much solutes I have so for each molecule

502
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:28,840
of salt that I put in solution I get two

503
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:30,919
um molecules that are um of the ions

504
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,200
and but in some sense you should also

505
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:38,360
account for the fact that U these

506
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,440
hydrated or solvated uh

507
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,640
groups

508
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:49,159
um uh since they like to stay each other

509
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:53,000
they could be also thought as like a big

510
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,960
molecule so so part of the water

511
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,200
molecules that are in

512
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,840
solution um get engaged in the these

513
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,159
solvation groups and so they're not

514
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,320
available anymore as to play the role of

515
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,080
the of solvent okay so their mole

516
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,360
fraction of water also changes because

517
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:19,360
you lose six molecules per

518
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,360
ion uh that is formed

519
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,000
here

520
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:31,559
so let's see yeah so the number of

521
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,120
molecules of water initially are

522
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:39,760
uh the mass which is 1 kilogram minus

523
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,600
the 35 gram so it's 965

524
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,320
grams and if you divide it by the

525
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,279
molecular weight you get how many moles

526
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:55,840
of water you have

527
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:59,480
initially and then uh for the ions their

528
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:05,440
amounts are the 3 5 gram divided by the

529
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:09,840
molecular weight of the salt of the salt

530
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:13,440
not the ions which is gives this much

531
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,279
moles so these are how many molecules of

532
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,279
salt you have put

533
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:25,120
in and then um you assume that the mole

534
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,120
fractions

535
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:32,559
uh that as as they go in you double this

536
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:38,159
amount all right so in the end you you

537
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,159
can compute uh the mole fraction of

538
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,640
water

539
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,720
and minus its

540
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,799
logarithm you can check of course that

541
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,360
the tailor series approximation is good

542
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:55,320
because this is a small

543
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:57,279
number this is the mole fraction is 978

544
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,880
so it's very close to one so that

545
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,799
approximation but if you do the

546
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,919
calculation there is a little difference

547
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:08,519
1 minus y is a little different from

548
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,679
minus log of

549
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,679
Y so let me just keep minus log of Y

550
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,200
without that approximation which since

551
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,519
we can do

552
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,880
logarithms and and we can compute

553
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:25,159
therefore the partial pressure I mean

554
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:28,320
the the osmotic pressure using uh

555
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:33,320
v r

556
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:36,000
I assume 298 just to put a number here

557
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,840
the specific volume here is correct is

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,279
with a double I double one is the

559
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:47,440
specific volume of pure water so it's 10

560
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:49,000
cubic Met 10 the minus 3 cubic meters

561
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,360
per

562
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,120
kilogram but since we need it in moles

563
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:59,279
we have to multiply times the molecular

564
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,279
weight of water

565
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,840
and in the end you can compute this in

566
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,919
terms of kilopascals or bars depending

567
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:11,840
on what makes you uh have a better

568
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,480
feeling of how much this pressure is you

569
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,320
know atmospheric pressure is one bar

570
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,320
more or less and

571
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:23,840
so the osmotic pressure this osmotic

572
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,919
pressure is 30

573
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,919
bars you can measure it in terms of a

574
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,279
column of

575
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:36,679
water the the weight of a colum of water

576
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:39,840
gives a pressure it's 300

577
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:43,320
M now it turns out that this number is

578
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,320
not precise because there we've made

579
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,799
some approximations here for example we

580
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,159
have neglected these ion

581
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:54,760
pairs uh the true

582
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:58,919
number first of all it

583
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,159
varies uh from place to place for

584
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,919
example in the Mediterranean it's higher

585
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:07,440
than than in the Atlantic or in the

586
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,320
Pacific or in the Arctic is even lower

587
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,799
so there is a range of values of

588
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,480
salinity that go between 30 and

589
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,919
38 and the measured

590
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,880
uh osmotic

591
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,080
pressures are

592
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,320
between 220 and 290

593
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,240
mters still it's not too bad but you we

594
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,799
can do

595
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,279
better so here is um sorry for the fine

596
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:40,679
print but I have U I

597
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:43,360
will uh put on um canvas the

598
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,639
um this Excel

599
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,440
file in which I've done the calculation

600
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:53,440
so this First

601
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:57,600
Column um gives that calculation that we

602
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,519
have just seen and that leads to a 310

603
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,159
uh meters

604
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,360
of of osmotic

605
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:10,159
pressure and we have assumed 100%

606
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,200
hydration and 0% ion Pairs and also we

607
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,760
have assumed no

608
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:19,080
water forgot to say it but we assume

609
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,600
that U uh I'm not counting for the water

610
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,240
molecules that are lost because they go

611
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:29,639
and formate these uh

612
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:32,360
groups now in these other uh column I do

613
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:36,960
the same calculation by assuming six

614
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:40,679
molecules per uh per per

615
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,480
ion uh and also by assuming that some of

616
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,159
these

617
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,639
18% of the ions are grouped in ion

618
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,120
pairs which are also surrounded by six

619
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:56,679
Waters okay if you do if you take that

620
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:01,559
now why did I take 18% that was just my

621
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:05,320
only uh fitting parameter in order to

622
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:08,159
get the measured value of

623
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,520
288 so if that were only the effect then

624
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,240
my model would would would get the

625
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,359
actual measured value by assuming this

626
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,399
percentage of ion pairs with respect to

627
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:23,599
the hydrated

628
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:25,560
ions and these other two columns give

629
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,000
you the same calculation with the same

630
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,639
parameters

631
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,240
but in the Mediterranean for example in

632
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,240
Naples you have this much

633
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:43,839
316 whereas in the Arctic Ocean uh it's

634
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:48,520
242 because the the because of the

635
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:51,560
changes the percentage of um of salt

636
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,560
that is dissolved

637
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,919
there now

638
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,680
first of all let's let's view it uh in

639
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,680
this

640
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,520
way so imagine you have

641
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,480
a a long

642
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:26,200
pipe so this is

643
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:32,040
air this is uh z =

644
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,040
z and this is Z = minus

645
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,400
H

646
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,680
so if the

647
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,000
density of of sea water is

648
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:48,359
approximately

649
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,359
uh equal to the density of

650
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:58,760
water and if I have here the pressure PA

651
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,760
a here what pressure do I have

652
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,920
okay that's the static

653
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,040
uh ber equation or whatever you want to

654
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,040
call it

655
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:18,160
okay all right

656
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:20,680
so now this is a porous plug semi

657
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,200
permeable to

658
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,200
um to just

659
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:32,000
water so suppose I want

660
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:36,079
to have

661
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:41,000
uh this level let's so this is called

662
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,000
let me call it minus H

663
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:53,880
uh one and this is H zero

664
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:56,520
okay so on the outside so below here I

665
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,119
have the pressure that I just said in

666
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,079
the sea water at that level that's the

667
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,960
pressure and it's

668
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,760
H1 on the other side of the

669
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,319
membrane I have a pressure that is given

670
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,400
by

671
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:17,240
um I assume that also

672
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,000
here the pressure is equal to

673
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,880
atmospheric it's it it's a bit higher

674
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,440
because of the column of air but we can

675
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,079
neglect the density of air of course and

676
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,440
so here is it's

677
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,440
PA plus

678
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:37,760
row it's again I assume that it's the

679
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,760
same row G

680
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,760
h0

681
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:49,599
okay so

682
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,599
across the membrane I have a pressure

683
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,359
difference right so the pressure

684
00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:00,160
difference is row

685
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,160
WG H1 minus

686
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,160
h0 and if I am at

687
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,040
equilibrium at the temperature that

688
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,640
prevails

689
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,640
there uh that is equal to the osmotic

690
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,160
pressure so that would

691
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:28,160
be uh the equivalent of row WG *

692
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
288 m

693
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:40,040
okay so there is a a a huge difference

694
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,160
in pressure there so this porox plug

695
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,160
must be must be able to sustain that

696
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,079
that that

697
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:53,560
pressure and in fact this is

698
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:58,359
why um as you know in many countries the

699
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:01,359
production of fresh water from uh sea

700
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,599
water or from other saline saline saline

701
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,160
Waters is

702
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,960
done

703
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:13,920
precisely this way uh it's not

704
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,280
really uh done in this you can do it uh

705
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:21,760
in a more

706
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:23,839
practical way this by having a you take

707
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,920
some water you take a

708
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,480
piston and then you push you generate

709
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,400
a high pressure

710
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,400
here so this is sea

711
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,520
water and

712
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,480
out on the other side of the membrane

713
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:47,800
you get uh fresh water in order to for

714
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:50,359
this to happen you have to

715
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,359
impress a

716
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:55,200
pressure if you want fresh water

717
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,520
atmospheric pressure here you need at

718
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:02,319
least 288 you need you need more if you

719
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,240
have just do 288 you you get a drop uh

720
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:08,640
if you uh put higher

721
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,200
pressure uh you get a

722
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,119
flow of course you need a membrane that

723
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,960
is capable like in the new graph capable

724
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,720
of sustaining those

725
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,640
pressures and that's why you need part

726
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,200
of the job is

727
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,160
to uh make the membrane and part of the

728
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,000
job is to sustain the pressure so that

729
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:37,079
the membrane can resist that that

730
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,680
pressure and that is how uh you make see

731
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:44,040
water now you could also ask yourself

732
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:47,240
what is the minimum work uh needed to uh

733
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,000
do this job because this is a very

734
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,520
energy consuming uh

735
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,480
activity uh and if

736
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:02,480
you and there are various uh there are

737
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,359
uh more than 20 different methods that

738
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,480
people have devised in order to separate

739
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,680
fresh water from seawater because of

740
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,960
course it's a it's a matter of survival

741
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,800
so it's

742
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,960
uh people have developed uh many ways

743
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,960
even in the old times when you didn't

744
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,240
have

745
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,720
electricity uh and

746
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:31,160
so you each of the methods has an

747
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,920
efficiency and if we talking about

748
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,640
second low efficiency like we like to do

749
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,760
in this course you'd have to compare

750
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,200
what you spend with the minimum you

751
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,640
could have spent and so what is the

752
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,640
minimum that we could we we need to

753
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:51,119
spend in order to produce one liter of

754
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,119
or one kilogram of fresh

755
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,800
water and uh

756
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,800
well you have it in front

757
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,920
here because suppose I had this long

758
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:17,640
pipe then and uh and this is my boat and

759
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:20,119
the guy takes a a bottle of an empty

760
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:24,640
bottle P pulls it

761
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:27,319
down uh or a bucket maybe it's easier

762
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,520
Take the bucket fill it with this water

763
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:30,559
which is fresh because it's on the other

764
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,800
side of the

765
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:37,520
membrane and pull it

766
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,960
up and then after a while this will be

767
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,319
replenished and you can get some

768
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:46,839
more so how much work do you need to do

769
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:50,640
that it's just the work for

770
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:50,640
lifting from here to

771
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,599
there so it's r

772
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,599
g essentially

773
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,880
and it turns out that it is

774
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:11,359
about I think I have it in I think it's

775
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,960
about one or I mean

776
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,440
uh

777
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:20,960
yeah well G is is about 10 row is about

778
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,960
uh one or so it's

779
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,960
about

780
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:35,880
20 and this I think is kilj per

781
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:37,200
kilogram is it kilj or is it Jews that's

782
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,280
the

783
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,800
question

784
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,800
uh because row is say

785
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,680
one uh kilogram

786
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,240
per

787
00:43:50,680 --> 00:44:00,640
cubic sorry row

788
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:03,319
is uh 10 the 3 Kil G per cubic met G for

789
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,240
Simplicity let's call it

790
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:09,599
10 m per second

791
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,520
squared and then the other is

792
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,359
288

793
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,200
M

794
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:20,200
so

795
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,200
uh

796
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:29,040
that's anybody wants to

797
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,040
help uh

798
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,960
so this is kilogram per that's Newton

799
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,119
kilopascals no this is pascals time 10^

800
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,319
3 is kilopascals per meter so this I

801
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:47,040
think it's

802
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,040
kilj well you check it

803
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,079
um there are other

804
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,160
ways in which for example if you I

805
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,880
didn't want to put because this is a

806
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:04,400
commercial product but if you go and uh

807
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,400
look up U uh solar

808
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:13,920
steel you find um an inflatable survival

809
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,720
object which has something like this so

810
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,400
this is an inflatable like donut shaped

811
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,520
uh thing with with a plastic Dome and

812
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,520
here is the seawat

813
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:35,480
so you get uh sunlight coming

814
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,079
in which makes some of the water inside

815
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,800
evaporate like in a green

816
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,559
house uh the the water vapor that

817
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,760
evaporates the salt remains here so so

818
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,400
what evaporates is just water so the

819
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:52,920
water vapor goes and uh uh forms and

820
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,480
condenses on here because you also

821
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,520
typically have some Breeze or some wind

822
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,200
that will cool that Dome and then the

823
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:06,280
drops by

824
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:09,000
um by capillarity stay uh and and get

825
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,839
collected on this side here So

826
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,280
eventually you get some water on this

827
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:17,119
side and you put a a little pipe and a

828
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,319
little bottle and you collect the your

829
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,400
water so that's a survival

830
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:24,400
kit for the

831
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:29,400
fisherman and

832
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,400
um what kind of efficiency would that

833
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:36,119
have that will also help me figure out

834
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:40,240
if this K should be there or

835
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:43,359
not how much energy how much solar

836
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,319
energy do I need in order to evaporate

837
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,319
one kilogram of

838
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,119
water it's the

839
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,920
enthalpy of vaporization of water which

840
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:59,800
is of the order of 200

841
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,040
200

842
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:06,240
KJ per

843
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:09,280
kilogram okay so I take this K away

844
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:15,319
because I know that the answer is that

845
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:20,359
uh that thing has an efficiency of uh

846
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:25,160
0.1% so it consumes a thousand

847
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:25,160
times uh the the minimum

848
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,240
these

849
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:35,440
ones um the

850
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:41,200
commercial let's see do I have it

851
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,200
somewhere yeah the commercial ones

852
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,359
uh

853
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:54,119
uh okay this is these are the most

854
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:56,839
typical most important uh um Industrial

855
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,200
Technologies uh one is called the

856
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:03,119
pressure osmosis which is

857
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:06,520
exactly like that and the other is

858
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:09,599
called um revers

859
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:13,559
electrodialysis which uses the fact that

860
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:15,280
since the ions are electrically so if

861
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:18,200
you put an electric field you can

862
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,880
separate the ions and and and therefore

863
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,240
take them away from the water so that's

864
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,760
one way of

865
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,920
separating which is a less efficiency

866
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,160
there is a factor of two of inefficiency

867
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,599
there because you have to separate the

868
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:34,480
two ions for each uh amount of water and

869
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:38,440
so uh I think that is the reason why

870
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:43,160
there is a this this factor of two in

871
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:46,079
the theoretical uh uh maximum efficiency

872
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:54,400
that or Min or minimum power that you

873
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:54,400
need to spend here it's for to treat um

874
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,319
one 1,000 cubic m second Okay the reason

875
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:06,280
I

876
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:08,119
was interested in this is because of

877
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,359
uh the

878
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:14,880
fact

879
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:14,880
that uh you

880
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:23,200
see uh here you have fresh water in

881
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,079
equilibrium with uh so this is an

882
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,960
equilibrium situation okay so that's the

883
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:32,280
fresh water if you add some fresh water

884
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,280
from from from from

885
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,599
above that uh fresh water this will add

886
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:43,040
to the pressure on the membrane and

887
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:47,319
therefore the water will flow into the

888
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:52,799
ocean okay so that's one

889
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:54,720
way that is would be an intelligent

890
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:58,240
way

891
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,680
to put fresh water in the in the

892
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,040
sea when do we put fresh water in the

893
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,920
sea why would you want to do it not the

894
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,720
fisherman because he wants to drink it

895
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:13,119
but the rivers rivers bring fresh water

896
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:18,880
to the sea no and uh and usually they

897
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,880
just dump it at the same level that's

898
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,640
dissipated the the best way would be to

899
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:27,520
take that water once for example one

900
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,359
bucket at a time I I take that that

901
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,000
water from the from the river I put it

902
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:36,280
in my bucket then

903
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,280
I let the backet go down

904
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,599
so while doing that with a pulle I have

905
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,559
an an

906
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:45,000
engine produce

907
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,760
electricity so and that is we know how

908
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
much

909
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:52,720
work we get this much work per kilogram

910
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,400
of water that we put down and then at

911
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,359
this level when when it is at this level

912
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:01,480
it will cross the membrane

913
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:04,400
spontaneously and I don't I don't need a

914
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,880
a big difference in in pressure to make

915
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,160
it

916
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,040
flow of

917
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,799
course I do need some different

918
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:17,440
impression otherwise the flow will not

919
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:19,119
be able to win the pressure drops in the

920
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:25,559
poros

921
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:28,559
plug so I do cannot obtain 100% of this

922
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,280
this would be zero power situation if I

923
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,680
need power so I need to do it at a

924
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,680
certain rate I need instead of being

925
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,920
here let's say being

926
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,119
halfway so I use this much head in order

927
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,960
to push the fresh water into the uh into

928
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:48,720
the into the sea in any case this is

929
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
what is called Blue

930
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:54,880
energy and it is a an enormous

931
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,880
uh uh

932
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,720
potential and it is of course a

933
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,559
renewable kind

934
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:05,599
of energy it has an enormous potential

935
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,240
in if you look at the what the rates are

936
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,240
for

937
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:18,440
Rivers so even if I take just the uh

938
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:21,160
this small contribution for the PO few

939
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:27,359
for for Po River in in Italy which is

940
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:32,240
only 6,000 cubic met per second

941
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:35,240
you see uh we we with with pressure

942
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,440
 osmosis power

943
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:41,960
plant we could

944
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,480
make uh 6 times 3,000 Mega so that's

945
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,880
18,000

946
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,880
megawatt that's like uh a

947
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,079
lot

948
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:03,640
okay and people have tried to do

949
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,799
this there are pilot plans but the

950
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:10,160
problem with these technologies that

951
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:10,160
have to do with that need

952
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,079
membranes is that

953
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:19,319
membranes get

954
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:23,319
clogged fresh water from the river it's

955
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:26,920
not really just water there is mud there

956
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:29,799
is dust uh so

957
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,880
you you need to keep these membranes

958
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:37,839
clean you need huge surfaces in order to

959
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:41,599
treat this kind of uh flow rates and

960
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:45,960
therefore uh up to now it hasn't

961
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:49,599
developed yet in a any reasonable

962
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,140
uh even small fraction of the

963
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,480
electricity

964
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,040
[Music]

965
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,960
produced yeah this map also shows the

966
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,920
salinity differences

967
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:05,960
in in the various oceans and seas here's

968
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:12,280
a Mediterranean that's about

969
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:14,599
38 here's the Arctic is below 30

970
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,960
33 now

971
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:22,200
the the idea of

972
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:28,119
um the this idea with you using the

973
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:28,119
pressure osmosis uh

974
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,559
is this and there there were there was a

975
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:38,319
a power plant in nor in Norway that

976
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:40,240
tried to do it but I think they closed

977
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,480
uh and I don't I think that there is

978
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,720
somebody else who was starting another

979
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,720
project in trying these

980
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:51,799
things so you get uh water from the

981
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:55,559
river and instead of putting it directly

982
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:59,480
so I put a nice wall here and the water

983
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,480
does uh have to go a different path it

984
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,160
has to

985
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:07,960
go into these pipes so these are pipes

986
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:13,480
made with uh porous material permeable

987
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,480
only to fresh water to to just the water

988
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:26,559
molecule okay so what I do is uh to put

989
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:26,559
inside on the inside I put seawat

990
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,119
uh

991
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:36,240
pressurized

992
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:41,839
pressurized

993
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:44,119
uh not to the uh osmotic pressure

994
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:50,880
because otherwise we would have no

995
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:53,160
flow but to a pressure which is um sort

996
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,160
of

997
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:59,200
halfway the osmotic value that way there

998
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,920
there would be the driving force that

999
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:08,000
would uh push water through the porous

1000
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:12,119
medium and so this pipe will U need to

1001
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,640
be uh in with an enlarging crosssection

1002
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:18,119
so as to accommodate this increasing

1003
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:22,280
flow of water so here is the sea water

1004
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:24,599
that gets in and what gets out is that

1005
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:28,240
sea water plus the water fresh water

1006
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:30,200
that has been added and then it goes uh

1007
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,760
here now of course in order to

1008
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,599
pressurize the seawat I have to consume

1009
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,599
energy with the

1010
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:43,240
pump and that

1011
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,680
pump is the work the power is is the

1012
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,280
product of

1013
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:50,440
the

1014
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:54,319
uh pressurization that I have managed to

1015
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,319
obtain times the volume flu

1016
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:01,119
rate and uh

1017
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:04,920
there should be a DOT there

1018
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:07,400
and and then the What flows out is again

1019
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,400
at that

1020
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,680
pressure perhaps a little less because

1021
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:17,760
of pressure

1022
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:21,440
drops and so it I don't just put it in

1023
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,240
water but it is a I put it in a turbine

1024
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:28,280
hydraulic turbine which is going to

1025
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:31,000
elaborate the uh higher volume flate

1026
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,440
because uh it's not only

1027
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,720
recuperating uh the volume fluorate that

1028
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,720
I have pumped but it also gets the

1029
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,000
volume of of of fresh water that has

1030
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:44,880
been added and so it's on the difference

1031
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,839
between this volume flu rate that I gain

1032
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,799
and again the the the net power is going

1033
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:53,920
to be the the difference between what I

1034
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:57,760
obtain from the turbine and what I spent

1035
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:01,319
from the uh pump all right so in

1036
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:07,079
principle this is relatively simple but

1037
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:12,000
again the problem is these uh uh

1038
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:12,000
porous medium and porous uh

1039
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,640
membranes okay so talking about

1040
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:29,760
um see this is a work this is

1041
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:36,240
this number that we obtained here is the

1042
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:38,640
work of separation of the some solvent

1043
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,359
from this dilute

1044
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,559
solution

1045
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:44,559
um in

1046
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,839
general the problem of separating stuff

1047
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:54,839
is important for many applications for

1048
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:57,799
example in the nuclear uh Power industry

1049
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:02,240
you have to

1050
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:03,680
uh separate in order to uh concentrate

1051
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:08,000
uranium

1052
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,720
235 uh you do you need to you make it

1053
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,480
into

1054
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:16,359
gas

1055
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,960
and EXA EXA Florine EXA Florine of

1056
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:22,599
uranium and and then you separate the

1057
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,559
gas uh using the fact that the molecules

1058
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:25,760
are

1059
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:26,799
different uh because they have a

1060
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:32,559
different

1061
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:32,559
um different isotopes the 238 from

1062
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:43,400
235 and and and so that is a consuming

1063
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:43,400
um energy in order to do this uh this

1064
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:54,520
separation okay so we know that

1065
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:57,000
we we did something very similar

1066
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:59,119
earlier so I'm going to to go quickly on

1067
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,799
these uh energy balances and entropy

1068
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,039
balances but the idea here is that we

1069
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:05,880
have a mixture in

1070
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:09,920
general given

1071
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,319
composition initially I mean in given

1072
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,720
temperature and pressure so now I'm

1073
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:14,520
going to operate at the given

1074
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:18,720
temperature and pressure which is could

1075
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:21,559
be for example the atmospheric

1076
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:25,400
Reservoir and I want to

1077
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:27,960
obtain a fully separated uh pure

1078
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,960
components

1079
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:34,640
of course in order to do that I need to

1080
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,400
spend some work that's represented by

1081
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,480
the weight that goes

1082
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:43,000
down so I

1083
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,760
do volume balance uh for the overall

1084
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,319
system including the

1085
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,240
reservoir

1086
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:54,079
uh here I call B and A B is the final

1087
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,079
State and a is the initial

1088
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:59,359
State uh so the energy balance the

1089
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:03,559
entropy

1090
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,559
balance and then the

1091
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:10,319
equation for the stable equilibria of

1092
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:12,720
the uh this Reservoir with a variable

1093
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:16,039
volume which is

1094
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:19,200
this then I combine as usual these

1095
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:21,119
equations by eliminating the

1096
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,680
reservoir

1097
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,280
variables and here I'm also using the

1098
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,559
fact that the final since we are in in

1099
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,640
equilibrium with the

1100
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:34,680
reservoir uh it fixes also the final

1101
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:41,119
temperatures of the pure components at

1102
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:41,119
the end so t b t a is equal to

1103
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:52,280
tr and the linear combination of these

1104
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:52,280
balances yields this expression for the

1105
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:59,200
work with is one of those characteristic

1106
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,799
functions I think it's the one that we

1107
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,799
called with the letter uh

1108
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:11,039
fe uh and then there is a plus T times

1109
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:14,680
the entropy generated so if I do it in

1110
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:17,760
an irreversible process this will uh

1111
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:21,400
make me consume

1112
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,960
more but let's talk about the limit in

1113
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,599
which I do the best so this is not there

1114
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,680
so that would be the reversible case

1115
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:31,200
and then I recognize that this linear

1116
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,039
combination of properties is just the

1117
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,160
Gibs free energy so essentially the

1118
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,160
minimum work for separating at constant

1119
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:40,319
T and P is the difference between the

1120
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:43,960
Gibs free energy of the final separated

1121
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:46,400
State and the Gibs free energy of the

1122
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,400
initial

1123
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:55,240
mixture now since we know how to do uh

1124
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:56,720
things we know how to uh we know first

1125
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,160
of all that

1126
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,760
uh the Gibs free energy now in general

1127
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:06,279
it's not an additive property but if you

1128
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:09,079
if all the systems are at the same tnp

1129
01:03:06,279 --> 01:03:11,599
then the gift free energy is

1130
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:15,039
additive and so in the final

1131
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:17,160
State uh the GS free energy of the

1132
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:20,559
composite is equal to Simply the GS free

1133
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,720
energy of uh the sum of the gsy energy

1134
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,839
of the

1135
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,799
parts and again here I've used the fact

1136
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:28,839
that the Gib free energy of the pure

1137
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:31,760
component is also equal to the chemical

1138
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:34,039
potential of the pure

1139
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,119
component whereas for the

1140
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:39,319
mixture the Gibs free energy due to the

1141
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,920
oiler relation is related to the

1142
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:43,000
chemical

1143
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,279
potentials so it's the weighted sum of

1144
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,920
the chemical

1145
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:51,119
potentials and up to here we made no

1146
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:54,599
assumptions if we further make an

1147
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:58,960
assumption of either U being in a case

1148
01:03:54,599 --> 01:04:02,680
of a Gibs Dalton mixture of Ideal

1149
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:05,440
gases or an ideal solution and this time

1150
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,799
it's ideal in for all components not

1151
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,799
just the

1152
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:15,400
solvent then if we apply the rules that

1153
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:18,319
we have seen uh so many times now this

1154
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:23,119
gives us a formula which is similar to

1155
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:27,640
the uh entropy of mixing

1156
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:30,440
okay so suppose for example that we want

1157
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:35,039
to separate uh

1158
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,039
air we want to separate air into its

1159
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:43,160
components now air is a mixture of many

1160
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:46,480
gases it's not just nitrogen and

1161
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,799
oxygen the typical

1162
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:53,240
composition at sea

1163
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:57,319
level is this one 78% of

1164
01:04:53,240 --> 01:05:01,279
nitrogen almost 21 of oxygen

1165
01:04:57,319 --> 01:05:03,119
.9% almost 1% of

1166
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:08,559
argon and

1167
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,559
0.04% these are the 400 ppms of

1168
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:16,920
CO2 so I

1169
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,079
can I want to compute this

1170
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,720
uh this

1171
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:33,400
summation and it's simple

1172
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:39,839
uh and then I want to divide it also

1173
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:43,400
by uh n m so that I get the result per

1174
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:45,119
kilogram of air so I have to divide by

1175
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,559
the molecular weight and the molecular

1176
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,359
weight is the weight at sum of the

1177
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,920
molecular weights of uh the VAR

1178
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:54,240
constituents weighted on the mole

1179
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,400
fractions so it's

1180
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,480
28.97 with this

1181
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,240
composition and then I choose a

1182
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,400
temperature say

1183
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:06,520
298k and here comes uh so the minimum

1184
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:09,000
work to separate air into its components

1185
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:12,000
one kilogram is

1186
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
48.5

1187
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,520
kilj we could have modeled air in a

1188
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,720
simpler way suppose air is just made of

1189
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,799
suppose we we have a a mixture in which

1190
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,960
I have only nitrogen and oxygen with the

1191
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:31,240
same relative composition as they have

1192
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,599
in in the actual air but there are no

1193
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:36,680
other

1194
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:36,680
components if it were only those

1195
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:43,119
two then they do the same calculation

1196
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:44,200
and see that the the work for separation

1197
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,599
is

1198
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,599
44 it's quite a bit of

1199
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:55,839
difference and this

1200
01:06:51,279 --> 01:06:58,920
additional about 4 KJ per kilogram here

1201
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:01,039
uh are needed because here I have

1202
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,440
insisted in separating all including

1203
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,680
argon and

1204
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:09,160
CO2 and those

1205
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:11,680
are uh very few molecules and they

1206
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:15,720
require uh a

1207
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,720
lot for separating per unit of amount

1208
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:21,119
that that you want to

1209
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:23,920
separate okay so this formula applies

1210
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:27,520
not only in the gas phase you could also

1211
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:33,079
apply for solution liquid

1212
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:39,799
phase for example let's take a mixture

1213
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:44,920
of uh water and ethanol which at the

1214
01:07:39,799 --> 01:07:47,920
appropriate mole fractions is like wine

1215
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:51,599
okay I a model for wine of course it's

1216
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:56,279
not just these elements but

1217
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:59,480
um so if I take a wine 14 Dees um

1218
01:07:56,279 --> 01:08:02,279
uh by volume that's Fe is the mole

1219
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:06,119
fraction it's is the volume fraction of

1220
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:09,640
alcohol in in

1221
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:12,200
wine um that makes you do the

1222
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:15,480
calculation to go to pass

1223
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:18,880
from volume fraction to mole fraction

1224
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:21,640
it's 4.7 mole

1225
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,880
fraction and if you want to separate

1226
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,560
entirely the water from the

1227
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:29,080
alcohol you apply this

1228
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:34,839
formula and again if you want to do it

1229
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:38,159
for 1 kilogram of wine it it it's 24

1230
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:38,159
kilj what you

1231
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,319
spend

1232
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:51,279
now the question

1233
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,159
is well if I want to separate for

1234
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,199
example if I want to produce

1235
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:59,319
oxygen because because I need it for

1236
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:01,440
medical applications or I want to

1237
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:04,159
produce nitrogen because I need it for

1238
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,159
agricultural

1239
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:09,600
applications or if I want to produce

1240
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:13,120
argon which is needed in the

1241
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,480
lab or if I want to separate CO2 from

1242
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,159
the atmosphere because I want to

1243
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,199
segregate it which is something that

1244
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:23,960
people are uh considering in these

1245
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:27,520
days how much do I do and do I have to

1246
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:29,600
separate entirely my my mixture well the

1247
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:33,080
answer is

1248
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:37,640
no what you could do you could you could

1249
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:39,759
do exactly just what you need not more

1250
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,880
if you do something if you separate

1251
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:45,719
something that you don't need then you

1252
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:47,719
spent energy to do the separation uh and

1253
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,880
you're left with something that since

1254
01:09:47,719 --> 01:09:51,640
you don't need it you mix it again so

1255
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,480
it's

1256
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,920
wasteful so concentrate on what you need

1257
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:01,760
so for example ex take your initial

1258
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,640
mixture say air and suppose uh you want

1259
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,159
to

1260
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,840
extract some

1261
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:13,360
oxygen so the best

1262
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:17,360
way the minimum expenditure would be to

1263
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:20,280
extract uh a little bit of

1264
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:22,120
oxygen with not the not the entire

1265
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:25,360
amount of oxygen in your air so you

1266
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:28,280
treat a volume of air and extract only a

1267
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,600
fraction of it a fraction of the oxygen

1268
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:34,800
that is present in that

1269
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:37,000
air so you put out air which is linear

1270
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,000
in

1271
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:43,600
oxygen uh and you have your oxygen here

1272
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:45,679
all right so so essentially this is what

1273
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:49,520
we're doing we

1274
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:51,960
take lots of oxygen little oxygen and

1275
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,520
then the little you separate and the lot

1276
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:56,719
you leave it with the air and the other

1277
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,239
components you leave it

1278
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,000
there

1279
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:04,640
okay you do the energy balances and the

1280
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,040
entropy balances and the volume balance

1281
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,080
is again and again you you find that the

1282
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,040
difference I mean the minimum work of

1283
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,000
separation is given by the difference in

1284
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,520
the GBS free

1285
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,880
energy of the final

1286
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:23,440
situation minus that of the initial

1287
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:27,440
mixture now the final situation or the

1288
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:32,040
final composite of mix plus the

1289
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:33,360
pure as uh therefore two contributions

1290
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,840
this is for the

1291
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:39,560
mixture which now has a final

1292
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,280
composition why mole fractions B which

1293
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:45,360
are different from the mole fractions

1294
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:49,760
that you started with plus you have the

1295
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:53,120
Gibs free energy of the pure component

1296
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,960
here and again remember that the

1297
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:59,960
chemical potential is for the pure

1298
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:02,719
substance the GS free energy and again

1299
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,199
we are using additivity for GS free

1300
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,000
energy because the two subsystems are at

1301
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:10,520
the same temperature and

1302
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,000
pressure for the mixture

1303
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:16,679
here I would have to write that the from

1304
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,600
the oiler relation that the GI free

1305
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:21,440
energy is simply the summation of the

1306
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,679
amounts times the chemical

1307
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,400
potentials I have to be careful though

1308
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:28,800
that when I get to comp component I in

1309
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,840
the summation there is this extra little

1310
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:34,280
piece so I'm I'm going to write uh this

1311
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,040
summation in two pieces one is with the

1312
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,920
ends that remain

1313
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:42,880
unchanged and the one that is separated

1314
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,679
I contribution it's multiplied by the

1315
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,560
same kind of same chemical potential but

1316
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:51,239
I put it outside so component I I will

1317
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,360
find it outside of the summation for the

1318
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:57,120
amounts that I separate and inside the

1319
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,120
summation for the amounts that remain

1320
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,920
s

1321
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:12,159
okay then I

1322
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:15,000
use ideal solution or ideal gi gi Dalton

1323
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:18,159
mixture Behavior so that I can

1324
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,239
express the chemical potentials of the

1325
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,760
mixture in terms of those two component

1326
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:26,679
times RT

1327
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:31,040
log Y and we doing that substitution I

1328
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:35,400
obtain this expression so this is the

1329
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,400
general expression for the

1330
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:43,639
work in

1331
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:46,800
terms of the uh initial

1332
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:48,800
amounts and of the amount that I have

1333
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,920
extracted of component

1334
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,800
I now there are several cases that may

1335
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:57,679
be interesed interesting for example I

1336
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:01,120
could consider the complete removal of

1337
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:04,480
constituent I so a case in which I I do

1338
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:08,320
want to take for example

1339
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:11,520
CO2 maybe I want to extract it all so I

1340
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:14,880
don't want to be uh that to be left with

1341
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,840
any in in my final mixture so ni I

1342
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:22,000
should be zero that's complete

1343
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:26,159
removal and that expression here gives

1344
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,159
us this result

1345
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:37,400
and there is an interesting uh possible

1346
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:40,800
limit uh which is one in which the mole

1347
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:43,280
initial mole fraction of my component

1348
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,239
like for example the CO2

1349
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,560
case the the initial mole fraction is

1350
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:52,440
very

1351
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:55,360
small because CO2 we said is four uh

1352
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:59,920
0.04%

1353
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:02,320
uh so that means very less than one in

1354
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,800
this case the second contribution goes

1355
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,840
away and so the minimum work is just

1356
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,040
minus

1357
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,760
log of the mole fraction the minimum

1358
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:14,080
work per unit

1359
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:19,239
amount

1360
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:19,239
extracted or you could use a partial

1361
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:28,719
removal in which I don't extract it all

1362
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:33,000
I exract only a fraction I could call

1363
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:35,520
this fraction key the amount that I have

1364
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:39,760
initially I want to say I want to

1365
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:43,120
extract only a fraction key of the uh of

1366
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:47,480
the of the initially present

1367
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:51,800
amount so that expression rewrites this

1368
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:55,520
way and here also there is a

1369
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:58,520
limit which uh is the same result

1370
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:02,239
but which obtains in the opposite

1371
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:06,159
situation when I extract when I separate

1372
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:10,000
only a minute fraction of the originally

1373
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:13,600
present amount this is typically used in

1374
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,600
the oxygen or

1375
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:20,639
nitrogen separation

1376
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:23,360
case

1377
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:30,120
Okay so if we do

1378
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:30,120
again assume this same um air that we

1379
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:37,320
considered standard

1380
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:42,080
conditions and suppose

1381
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:44,320
we want to do a minute or minor removal

1382
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:47,840
so that this fraction key is small so I

1383
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,840
can apply this formula

1384
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:55,639
here so if my objective is to extract

1385
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:58,400
one kilogram and these are per kilog of

1386
01:16:55,639 --> 01:17:01,120
the molecule that I want to extract so I

1387
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,040
want to extract 1 kilogram of nitrogen I

1388
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:07,199
spend

1389
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:11,120
21.9 KJ if I want to extract 1 kilogram

1390
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:14,440
of oxygen I spend

1391
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:19,320
121 it's more because oxygen is more

1392
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:22,600
rare it's by four times uh less if I

1393
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:27,800
want to extract argon it's 20 2

1394
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,800
290 if I want to extract CO2 is

1395
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:39,679
440 now of course so there

1396
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:39,679
are if I want

1397
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:45,760
[Music]

1398
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:47,360
to I want to make sure that I cannot

1399
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:51,000
build

1400
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:54,040
a perpetual motion machine of the second

1401
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,080
kind that would be something in which I

1402
01:17:54,040 --> 01:18:00,040
use

1403
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,040
uh this method of

1404
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:06,800
separation and then once I have SE

1405
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:11,000
separated then I mix them again and we

1406
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,000
know that by mixing you can extract

1407
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:22,199
work so clearly if I start from Air I

1408
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:25,840
separate it and I spend so much to

1409
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:28,280
separate it then when I mix it gain the

1410
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,560
maximum work I can separate must be

1411
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:37,679
equal I can obtain must be equal to the

1412
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:37,679
minimum work uh of uh of of of

1413
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,520
Separation so for example if I

1414
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,840
take

1415
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:50,600
uh the right amount of

1416
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:55,760
nitrogen that is needed to form

1417
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:58,440
again H uh the the air original

1418
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,560
composition I have this is the right

1419
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:03,000
that right

1420
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:06,360
amount uh

1421
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,719
so I have to multiply these ones times

1422
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,159
those

1423
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:14,000
amounts and then of

1424
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:17,400
course the sum of these works properly

1425
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:23,280
weighted by those amounts gives me the

1426
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:25,320
same uh work that I can obtain by mixing

1427
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:29,239
which is so this 48

1428
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:31,639
.5 is uh the same work of Separation

1429
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:34,520
that we have used in the complete

1430
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:37,719
separation case in the previous slide so

1431
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,719
this is just a consistency

1432
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,920
check also here I have another uh Excel

1433
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,360
file that I will

1434
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:51,600
share in which these calculations

1435
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,600
are are

1436
01:19:51,840 --> 01:20:02,320
done and uh for uh so so this contain uh

1437
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:06,120
uh this is where I I took those uh those

1438
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,120
results um and

1439
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:15,400
it and for example the checking yeah the

1440
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:18,360
check okay see this this is the partial

1441
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:21,600
removal partial removal

1442
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:24,800
separation uh these are

1443
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:28,880
the amounts

1444
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:33,040
of the the mass percentages of uh the

1445
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:36,560
various constituents in air so if I take

1446
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:40,880
the weighted sum of this times that I

1447
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:44,840
obtain the same as if I did the complete

1448
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:50,120
separation okay now this

1449
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:53,159
also is a the same or another Excel file

1450
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:57,280
there is this calculation of the alcohol

1451
01:20:53,159 --> 01:21:00,040
content and the preparation for

1452
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,520
wine it's interesting

1453
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:06,199
that takes a while to we have to be

1454
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:07,600
careful with the volume fractions Mo

1455
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:11,360
fractions Mass

1456
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:14,000
fractions can get uh confusing but

1457
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:17,440
eventually you figure it

1458
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:22,600
out so this is already the result that I

1459
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:22,600
mentioned before what was the

1460
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:30,760
number yeah 21 KJ per liter if I take

1461
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:36,400
wine uh yeah this is a

1462
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:37,600
12 12 12 degrees 12 um volume fraction

1463
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:40,520
of

1464
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:44,040
ethanol

1465
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:49,280
12% uh we in this other thing is an

1466
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:52,800
application of the partial removal

1467
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:55,560
case in wine making

1468
01:21:52,800 --> 01:22:00,600
sometimes uh

1469
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:05,639
in in wine makers in the north of Europe

1470
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:08,159
where there isn't so much sunshine you

1471
01:22:05,639 --> 01:22:12,520
the the alcohol content the natural

1472
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:15,480
alcohol content that you obtain is low

1473
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:19,760
and you have to find ways to raise it

1474
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:22,199
one way is to buy uh wine it used to be

1475
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:26,400
that they it was used to be cheaper to

1476
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:30,480
buy wine from uh south of Italy or from

1477
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:32,360
Greece or from Spain because uh there

1478
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:35,400
you get a lot of sunshine and so the

1479
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:38,920
alcohol content is high and it used to

1480
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:40,639
be called The Cut wine to cut the the

1481
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:45,159
poorer wines of the

1482
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:46,920
north but now also the people uh in

1483
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:49,760
south of Italy Greece and so on have

1484
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,120
learned to make good wines and so they

1485
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,600
don't sell it for for for LW anymore so

1486
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:59,560
uh an alternative is

1487
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,800
to uh separate take a little bit of

1488
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:06,000
water

1489
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:07,320
away from the uh so for example suppose

1490
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,480
you have a 12

1491
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,199
degrees uh wine and you want to bring it

1492
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,760
to

1493
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:17,600
14 all you need to do is to take some

1494
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:19,880
water away of course you have to you

1495
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,920
cannot boil it otherwise going going to

1496
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:26,679
ruin the one but maybe you can Flash it

1497
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:28,960
uh low pressures so that at room

1498
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:31,440
temperature you get some so there are

1499
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:36,000
ways in which you can extract without

1500
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:39,040
ruining the uh the rest of the good part

1501
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,920
of of the wi and so this calculation

1502
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,400
gives

1503
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:46,360
you with the formulas that we've given

1504
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:49,800
it U all you need to do is to figure out

1505
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:54,560
how much water do I have to take

1506
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:58,440
away and so this is the the Delta n N1

1507
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:00,880
that I need um if you look inside there

1508
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,159
is a Formula that shows you how I

1509
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,440
calculated

1510
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:08,360
that and once I I determine that I can I

1511
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:13,360
I I can

1512
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:14,960
apply um I can find the key so the the

1513
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,840
cut fraction

1514
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,960
that we defined in the slide and we

1515
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:24,480
apply those formulas and uh it comes out

1516
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:27,639
that we need to spend 86

1517
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:30,600
kilj per liter in order to make this

1518
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:34,000
little Improvement in the alcohol

1519
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:36,360
content and of course therefore you find

1520
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,400
that the wine if you do this way you

1521
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:41,800
find that the wine making becomes also

1522
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,800
an energy an

1523
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:50,280
energy energ how do you say

1524
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,000
energ an indust energy consuming

1525
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:56,320
industry

1526
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,320
yes right okay

1527
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:05,760
okay

1528
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:08,280
so let me move on to uh

1529
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,760
another interesting application it has

1530
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:15,040
still to do with

1531
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:18,320
air it has to do with

1532
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:21,639
stratification of

1533
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,639
air as you

1534
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:27,080
know um

1535
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:31,960
air is

1536
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:34,600
stratified uh as you go up to high

1537
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:38,000
mountains for example top of Mount

1538
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:42,280
Everest uh you can read books about what

1539
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:46,400
they call thin air so why is it thin

1540
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:51,159
okay it's thin for two reasons it's thin

1541
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:52,840
because it uh the the overall pressure

1542
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:55,719
is

1543
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:59,199
low Maybe 1 third of the atmospheric

1544
01:25:55,719 --> 01:26:02,520
pressure at sea level and it's thinner

1545
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:06,800
also because the oxygen

1546
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:10,159
content percentage wise is

1547
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:13,480
less why less because the oxygen

1548
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:18,040
molecules are molecular weight

1549
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:21,679
32 nitrogen molecules 28 so the oxygen

1550
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:24,639
is heavier and St like likes to stay

1551
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,119
more towards the sea okay so the

1552
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:30,040
stratification is due to these

1553
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:32,280
differences in molecular weights of the

1554
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:37,840
molecules and since we are so interested

1555
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:41,040
in CO2 CO2 is 44 molecular weight so

1556
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:44,320
even more there is there is a

1557
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,320
stratification for

1558
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:53,000
example when we

1559
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:54,239
say uh ah the CO2 concentration at manua

1560
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,679
which is the place where they measure

1561
01:26:54,239 --> 01:27:00,159
measure CO2 uh is a mountain that

1562
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,840
mountain is at 35

1563
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:04,159
3400

1564
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,800
M

1565
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:10,280
altitude okay it's also maybe

1566
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:13,400
representative of the content of the

1567
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:18,480
average content in the atmosphere but

1568
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:21,880
the point is that if there there is 400

1569
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:25,960
and 26 PPM for example

1570
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:29,119
today uh it's means that at C Level you

1571
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,600
have 500 and something we'll calculate

1572
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:33,199
it in a

1573
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,080
moment so it's there is a big difference

1574
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:37,080
due to this CH the differences in

1575
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:39,880
molecular weights of the

1576
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,199
molecules so how do we go about and do

1577
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:44,840
this

1578
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:48,639
calculation we need a model as as usual

1579
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:51,440
and the the model that we we

1580
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:55,159
make uh is very

1581
01:27:51,440 --> 01:28:00,159
similar to the model that we have

1582
01:27:55,159 --> 01:28:02,960
made for bulk flow you remember for bulk

1583
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:06,639
flow we said if you have a fluid

1584
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,639
element which finds

1585
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:17,920
itself at elevation Z in the gravity

1586
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:21,320
field and which has uh a

1587
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:25,320
velocity let me call it

1588
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,320
w um

1589
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:31,480
and it has a mass

1590
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:35,440
m

1591
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:38,719
okay when we do fluid

1592
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:43,679
mechanics uh this is a fluid element or

1593
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:46,080
a fluid parcel called for and we assign

1594
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:49,280
the properties in the in the local

1595
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:52,159
equilibrium uh assumption we assign the

1596
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:55,320
properties of this uh fluid element by

1597
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:59,560
assuming that it's uh

1598
01:28:55,320 --> 01:29:01,679
energy is the energy that it would

1599
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:07,040
have with the

1600
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:07,040
same composition volume and

1601
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:16,520
entropy in a stable equilibrium

1602
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:20,199
State plus we add these mechanical

1603
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,199
effects that are the kinetic

1604
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,560
energy and the potential

1605
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:37,639
energy

1606
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:40,360
okay and yeah we'll the next time we'll

1607
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:44,159
assume also that this particle has a

1608
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:51,639
charge electrical charge and that finds

1609
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:51,639
itself in a uh for example an electric

1610
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:58,960
field okay in that CA or yeah an elect

1611
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,679
electric field is really minus the

1612
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,360
gradient of

1613
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:09,360
a electric

1614
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:11,320
potential and so here we will add uh Q

1615
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,600
times

1616
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:16,760
Fe it's

1617
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:20,119
another it's another mechanical kind of

1618
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:23,480
effect so the thermal aspect of the

1619
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:24,639
properties are still contained in the

1620
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:28,679
fundamental

1621
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,679
uh relation for stable equilibrium

1622
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:34,480
State and these are other additional

1623
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:42,400
contributions now for the problem of

1624
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:45,960
stratification in the atmosphere

1625
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:48,360
here all we need to do is to forget

1626
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:51,239
about motion so we we are talking about

1627
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:54,679
a Ste atmosphere of course it's a model

1628
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:54,679
and not charge

1629
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:05,119
so we have this potential energy and

1630
01:31:02,679 --> 01:31:11,800
M is the

1631
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:14,760
bass of uh the fluid uh element which

1632
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:16,639
may vary we're going to assume that it

1633
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,280
may vary here

1634
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:25,480
because since the composition changes

1635
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:25,480
with elevation also the mass changes

1636
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,440
so the mass is given by

1637
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:34,080
the

1638
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:34,080
moles times the molecular

1639
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:44,560
weights okay so this is the C Level this

1640
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:46,880
is the generic layer at elevation

1641
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,159
Z where we assume that there is a

1642
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,600
temperature a pressure and the

1643
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:54,239
composition and there is a adjacent

1644
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:55,800
laser lay layer which at Z Plus DZ with

1645
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:59,480
a different temperature different

1646
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,480
pressure and different

1647
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:09,880
composition now when we have this kind

1648
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:09,880
of uh

1649
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:16,040
energy

1650
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:18,719
uh you remember then when we talk about

1651
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:20,679
U when we derive the conditions for

1652
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:22,840
Mutual

1653
01:32:20,679 --> 01:32:25,840
equilibrium uh the conditions for Mutual

1654
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,840
equilibrium

1655
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:32,679
where equalities between some partial

1656
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:35,239
derivatives of the energy uh of the

1657
01:32:32,679 --> 01:32:35,239
fundamental

1658
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:40,280
relation that precisely because they

1659
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,800
appear in these conditions for Mutual

1660
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:47,000
equilibrium are important and that's why

1661
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:49,480
we give them names temperature pressure

1662
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,480
chemical

1663
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:55,280
potentials but here when we take the

1664
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,920
derivative of energy with respect to S

1665
01:32:55,280 --> 01:33:00,639
and V it's we still get temperature and

1666
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,560
pressure but in in a model like this

1667
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:04,560
when we take the derivative of e with

1668
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:07,360
respect to the amounts I have the

1669
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:09,239
amounts here which give me the CH

1670
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:12,320
chemical potential contribution but I

1671
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:14,040
have the amounts also inside the mass

1672
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:18,280
which gives me an additional

1673
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:18,280
contribution which is a gravitational uh

1674
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,400
contribution if I had the charge which

1675
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:27,679
we'll do next time we'll have also a an

1676
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:32,159
electrical contribution so we will have

1677
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:37,320
uh today we so this more General kind of

1678
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:39,600
chemical potential potential that uh so

1679
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:42,080
far we've called chemical we will call

1680
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,400
the total potential because it has

1681
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:47,000
several contributions and when it is

1682
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:48,560
only chemical plus electrical it's the

1683
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,440
electrochemical

1684
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:54,600
potential uh today for the

1685
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:57,639
stratification problem you could call it

1686
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:59,239
[Music]

1687
01:33:57,639 --> 01:34:02,880
what is

1688
01:33:59,239 --> 01:34:05,320
electrochemical gravito chemical okay

1689
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,520
gravito chemical

1690
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:11,159
potential whatever the name doesn't

1691
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:14,800
matter what's important is that you this

1692
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:16,800
total potential is given by the chemical

1693
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:20,840
potential so it's the derivative of this

1694
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:27,080
one plus the derivative of M and so that

1695
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:29,119
brings up the molecular uh weight of the

1696
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:31,080
molecule with respect to which you are

1697
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:35,040
taking the

1698
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:38,920
Der so I think we we're done today but

1699
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:41,719
the idea is that uh we will obtain our

1700
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:43,080
results and there the the distribution

1701
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:45,440
in

1702
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:49,199
concentrations by

1703
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:53,000
imposing chemical potential equality

1704
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:54,840
between layers because the layers are

1705
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,520
attached to one another so they are in

1706
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,719
mutual

1707
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,920
equilibrium in practice they are not

1708
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:04,920
because as you know the temperature in

1709
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:07,000
the atmosphere is not uh

1710
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:10,560
uniform we will

1711
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,639
assume that this changing temperature in

1712
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,040
the

1713
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:18,040
atmosphere uh can be neglected locally

1714
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:20,280
but not globally okay so with that will

1715
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:23,280
be a little bit of an assumption so we

1716
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:26,239
assume that we make an equilibrium

1717
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:29,000
between these two assuming that t zdz is

1718
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:31,960
equal to T at

1719
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:35,040
Z but we will not assume that the

1720
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:38,480
chemical potentials are and that's how

1721
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:42,000
we will get our

1722
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:43,800
results but the time is up and so I

1723
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,440
think I have

1724
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:52,840
to Simply wish you a good uh spring

1725
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:52,840
break and see you in 10 days
