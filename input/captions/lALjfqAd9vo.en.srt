1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,600
Thank you so much. It's such a pleasure

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,839
to be here. Thank you for the

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,480
invitation. It was lovely to have a

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,719
reunion uh yesterday night. It's as a

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,280
former my former life. I was doing human

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,119
genetics. I'm not an active member of

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
the V2F community, but it's such a

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,720
pleasure to get to meet all of you

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,279
today. was honored to come and share

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,279
with you some of the work resources and

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,080
tools we are developing as part of um

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,719
our work done in the humanlas initiative

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,800
where I'm currently the vice co-chair

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,320
and so while I do my favorite cells are

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,120
immune cells I'm hoping that some of the

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,280
frameworks I will present can be useful

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,079
to your community here these are my

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
financial disclosures and so this is a

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
quick outline so you know where I'm

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,200
going to go with the presentation I want

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,320
to tell you about some for our first

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,320
large human blood at list which is

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,480
compiling over 40 million cells across

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,719
40 different conditions some of the

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,359
challenges we had to overcome to

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,039
integrate so many different data sets uh

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,559
how we're tackling sanitation challenges

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,560
and how we're deriving novel biological

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,320
insights and I promise I have some

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
snippets that are relevant to varant to

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,000
function in there so kind of bear with

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,360
me so why did we start with blood right

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
you can say oh this is the most boring

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
tissue actually when you think about

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
translating our findings clinically. It

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,439
is a window in human health. It is

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
easily sampled. It's bio bank everywhere

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,520
in the world across all clinical trials.

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
Very easy to collect in the clinic. When

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
you think about methods development for

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,600
single cell multiomics, in this case

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
we're going to talk a lot about single

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,920
cell RNA sequencing. These are the

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
largest data sets that are out there

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,720
right now. And so there's an opportunity

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,680
to try to uh go beyond every individual

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,600
studies that have been published

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
bringing them together to derive more

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,759
powerful insights. And so what we

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
hypothesized coming um through this

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,280
project is that if we could integrate as

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,119
many D cell as possible would saturate

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,360
the signal that can be detected in the

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
blood uh with the hypothesis that

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,680
there's going to be a finite number of

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,040
distinct cell subset identity in the

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
blood and some of them will be conserved

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,399
across disease and that could help you

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,319
hone in on some of these conserved

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
cellar programs

61
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,720
and so I'm going to show you some

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
highlights of how we've been working

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
towards 40 million cells. I'm like the

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
hungry hippo. I always want more cells.

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
And so I told my lab, it would be so

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,879
much better if we I think some of them

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
are in the other room. There's a

68
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,239
witnesses here at like 50 million. We're

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
working towards it uh across over 5,000

70
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560
samples and 40 different immune

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
conditions. And I'll walk you through

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
for in case there's some immune lovers

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
in the room of the different data sets

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
we've compiled. So starting with some

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,040
four large integrated immune atlases.

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
One of the ones we're currently wrapping

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,560
up which was tied to a lot of um

78
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,640
computational methods development is

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,959
tied to the human atlas in case you've

80
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,959
never heard of it. It's um an

81
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,120
international endeavor that includes

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,360
over 104 countries across uh four 4,000

83
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
members across 104 countries. And our

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
mission is to create a comprehensive

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
reference map of all the cell types and

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,519
properties of um human cells and human

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,440
body health and eventually disease. And

88
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,159
so these are the members of our version

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,519
one uh means Atlas. Uh we have groups

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:15,440
represented across Singapore, UK,

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,599
Germany, um uh Spain and of course

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,080
Boston with trainee across all of these

93
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,560
different sites. And some of our initial

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
goals are to establish a detailed

95
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
reference of all circling cells so that

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,599
when we move to tissue which we are

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
moving to tissue becomes very easy to

98
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,319
distinguish resident from circling

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,000
cells. it turns out to not be trivial to

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,599
uh integrate so many data sets. So we're

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,280
optimizing computational frameworks to

102
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,599
do so and um I don't know how it is for

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
other communities but imunologists are

104
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,159
very passionate about how we call cell

105
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,080
types and so there's actually a need to

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,120
come together with the same data set to

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
have this conversation in a more

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
productive way. I'm going to show you

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
how we're doing this and of course we

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
want to support downstream biological

111
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,080
queries. Some of our goal of cell atlas

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,599
is to have a comprehensive globally

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
represented atlas. So we actually have

114
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,959
data sets from all around the world in

115
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,640
there. So you can also see how genetic

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,400
diversity can shape seller identity. So

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,560
uh I should say the first one let me go

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,560
back if I'm capable of doing that um

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
focuses on healthy and covid. That's

120
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,880
mostly because we needed data sets with

121
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,440
the same pathology across multiple

122
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,600
institution. We've also teamed up with

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,479
Dr. um Hogar Hines from um Synak in

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,960
Barcelona who has now this data set in

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,639
preprint and their whole goal is to

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,800
build a disease classifier using blood.

127
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,800
So if you you know select you know a few

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
drops of blood can we tell which disease

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,880
you have. So we've integrated their

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,639
data. There's also beautiful studies

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,240
that have been published uh in preprint

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,000
from the institute and um from UNL where

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,000
we've also integrated their data and

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,639
that's how we get to 29 million cells

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,759
across over 3,000 donors. We've also

136
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
went through everything that's been

137
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,479
published in the literature and gathers

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
across healthy infectious disease

139
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,560
autoimmune disease and adverse events to

140
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,840
checkpoint. We got another 5 million

141
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,840
cells and my lab uh contributed another

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,360
8 million cells of unpublished data

143
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
across healthy infectious disease

144
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,520
autoimmune disease and adverse events to

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,360
checkpoint and that's the breakdown on

146
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,199
the yeah you're left uh of the different

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
groups of disease autoimmune disease

148
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
infectious adverse events. You'll notice

149
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,800
we don't have hem malignancy. We're

150
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,720
really focused on trying to understand

151
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,080
the biology tied to the host. And so

152
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,840
with that we have data across single RNA

153
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,440
sequencing we have um surface protein we

154
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,880
have single cell TCR sequencing and I'm

155
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,080
sure somebody's going to ask me where's

156
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,199
the genotypes I this study was not

157
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,720
designed uh it's retrospective data so

158
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,160
we don't have a lot of genotype data but

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,639
I'm going to show you how we can still

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,800
try to pinpoint similar context that may

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,880
be relevant to G-W was and this is the

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,199
amazing team we have here bridging

163
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,800
between uh the broad institute and M

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,800
General Hospital. It's an effort that

165
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,759
I'm uh co-leading here with Gary

166
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,440
Reynolds um in leading the integration

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
and leading the data generation across

168
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,800
all of the all of these disease. And so

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,560
we have four main objectives. The first

170
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
one is to create that foundational

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,039
resources, right? We want to be able to

172
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,080
uh create a resource that anybody can

173
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,120
use to map annotation for circling cells

174
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
moving forward so you don't have to

175
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,919
reenotate over and over again. We also

176
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,080
want to benchmark better ways of doing

177
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,639
cell notation from a translational

178
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,960
perspective. We want to try to start

179
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
mapping the similar molecular programs

180
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,240
that are share cross disease. I realize

181
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
this is blood, but you might be

182
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
surprised. I'm going to show you that

183
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,680
even in blood uh where the disease is

184
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
not unfolding. Some of them are systemic

185
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
disease, you do find these share

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,240
programs and and start thinking about

187
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
potential targets here.

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
So I'm going to spend the next few

189
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,840
slides telling you how we optimize our

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,440
computational framework. It's actually

191
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,600
not trivial to do. So it would be so

192
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
much easier if we had generated these 40

193
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,319
million cells in a single institute. But

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
this is hundreds of studies. So we had

195
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
to optimize the framework using a subset

196
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,680
of studies and we picked autoimmune

197
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,520
disease to do so. Why? So well they're

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
tractable cell number. We know the

199
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,960
biology. So we know some ground truth.

200
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,919
there was moderate batch effect because

201
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,639
we generated a lot of data locally and

202
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,199
um you know we had to figure this out

203
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,639
because the current computational

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,280
workflow that existed when we started

205
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,080
this this project um couldn't handle

206
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,039
that many cells and so why for those of

207
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
you who don't think like me about

208
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,960
autoimmune disease all the time why

209
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,720
start there well we already know there's

210
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,919
a lot of commonalities across autoimmune

211
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,599
disease you know we know in terms of

212
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,880
organ involvement there's a lot of

213
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,680
organs that are involved in different

214
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,080
autoimmune disease we actually know that

215
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,080
some disease responds to the same

216
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,639
treatment. Also hinting that there's

217
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,560
some commonalities and for all of you

218
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
with the V2F community, you probably

219
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
already know that there's a lot of

220
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,319
genetic varants that are shared across

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,879
the disease also pointing out to

222
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,879
commonalities. And so this is where we

223
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,960
started. What were the main challenges?

224
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,199
Um uh so first integration we spent over

225
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,479
two years on this. I promise this is not

226
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,960
going to bore you with this because it's

227
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,720
very dry but uh we're going to release

228
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
all of our code so that people can see

229
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,560
how we've done this. We spent a lot of

230
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,360
time optimizing how we do quality

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,759
controls for raw data and uh processing

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
and pistic processing. How do you

233
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,960
optimize integration strategy in terms

234
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
of feature selection when you have to

235
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,199
deal with disease and normal tissue? And

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
so thinking about highly variable gene

237
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,839
selection, we actually didn't take the

238
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,839
first integration tool out of the box.

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
We actually benchmarked five different

240
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,440
integration strategies, optimized

241
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,320
different parameters only onto two of

242
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,320
them uh harmony and SCVI and and the

243
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,600
winner for us has been harmony. And then

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,720
we did uh hyperparameter tuning on all

245
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,920
of these features here. And to take a

246
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
decision we had to develop both um

247
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,959
qualitative and quantitative

248
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
assessments. So on the left you have

249
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,440
quantitative assessments. uh so that

250
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,720
meant like looking at distribution of

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,279
source data set chemistry uh cell range

252
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,320
of version gender donor and so forth. We

253
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,480
also wanted to make sure that the

254
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,080
biology was conserved. So we know so

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,000
much about immune cells is a great place

256
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,560
to start. So for example we could tell

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,279
that some of these plasma cells we

258
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,640
couldn't um split the IGG from the IG

259
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
plasma cell. So for example this would

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,959
be an example of you know an embedding

261
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,440
would be rejecting. We use the SCIB

262
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
framework developed by the TI lab, but

263
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,600
we also been developing new metrics that

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,279
really assess a bological conservation.

265
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
For example, if you know groups of cells

266
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,000
like T-Rex are supposed to

267
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
collocicalize, you can actually quantify

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,720
this and kind of speed up identifying

269
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,560
the right set of parameters. So this is

270
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
the extent I'm going to bore you with

271
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,160
systemic assessment of integration, but

272
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
if you're curious and trying to tackle

273
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,040
this, please do reach out. And once we

274
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,519
have some embedding. So this is an

275
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
example of monosets and and a type of

276
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,320
dendric cells where we have unique

277
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,600
markers. We just make sure that across

278
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,720
all the different cell subs that

279
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,279
represented here. Um on the x-axis we

280
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,360
have good distribution across disease

281
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,440
type of in this case 10x chemistries

282
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
because we had over six different types

283
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,959
and across all studies. So this is an

284
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
example of like a you know a final

285
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,160
product here. The second challenge we

286
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,600
had was scalability in every sense of

287
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,680
the word. But in this case, I'm going to

288
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
talk about annotation. You know, if you

289
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,680
start processing tens of millions of

290
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,839
cells, you cannot easily annotate this

291
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,320
manually. Uh the traditional pipelines

292
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,880
are resource limited. And so we needed

293
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,839
to kind of find a way in in between what

294
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,040
imologists would accept and um what

295
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
computitional biologists would be

296
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,480
willing to work with. Uh and so we

297
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
develop SC tiger. You can imagine lab

298
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,760
spent a lot of time thinking about the

299
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,600
acronym here. It's for single cell

300
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,000
transcriptional imoprofiling guided by

301
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,079
expert resoning. And so the work the way

302
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it works is you know there's a lot of

303
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,000
that that is known already about the

304
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,600
immune cells. Nobody's going to come and

305
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,800
argue with me about what is a naive tea

306
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,480
cells or an aector tea cells but we want

307
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,279
to be able to quickly get to the

308
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,440
non-contentious label and then do the

309
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,519
discovery of of cells. So we built a

310
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,880
classifier uh and this is an this is not

311
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,920
exactly the classifier because it didn't

312
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,880
fit on the slide but essentially uh you

313
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,880
can split based on lineage um uh using

314
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,600
surface markers and we've developed sets

315
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,040
of gene program genes so that within

316
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,839
minutes we can get to non-contentious

317
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,279
buckets of cells um like the naive the

318
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,760
factor memory and so forth and from

319
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,760
there we do um unbiased clustering that

320
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,480
seems very logical for those of us that

321
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,880
do iminology technology. Um, but these

322
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,040
tools were not in place and so we did

323
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,720
our competition biologist against SC

324
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,279
tiger. They got to the same conclusion

325
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,279
except that biologist took two weeks

326
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,680
shuffling cells between bucket and SC

327
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,519
tiger took a day. And so this is what

328
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,560
we've implemented. So SC tiger in action

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,120
if you put this on half of our cells 20

330
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,880
20 million cells across 4,400 samples

331
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,279
and a little bit more than 40

332
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,320
conditions. This is what it looks like.

333
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,399
So uh you can start with the lineage

334
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,480
level the top level of the hierarchy we

335
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,880
can find our lineage you can do another

336
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,600
level of annotation and a third level of

337
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,240
annotation at which point these are the

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,880
different number of cells per cell

339
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,639
subset you can also look at them across

340
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,079
know the different conditions and once

341
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,920
we get to this point this is where we're

342
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,399
ready to do um cell type discovery and

343
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,320
so uh I'm going to do a little plug here

344
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,920
for another tool we've been uh

345
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,000
developing for sake of time I don't have

346
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,399
to do demos but I want to tell you about

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,720
how we're going to resolve annotation.

348
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
So you know if you give me 5 million T

349
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,920
cells to annotate and I give them to a

350
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,839
friend of mine the same 5 million T

351
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,880
cells I promise you we're going to get

352
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,720
to different results and different

353
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,560
annotation and different names. We might

354
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,839
regroup the cells the same way we might

355
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,079
not. We might give them the same

356
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,480
markers. We may not. It's a huge problem

357
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,720
in the community. At least I can talk

358
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,320
about the immune cell atlas community.

359
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
So same data same pipeline different

360
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,360
answers. How do we resolve this? And so,

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,519
uh, we're launching a cell edition

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
jamberee. If you're interested, you're

363
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,160
welcome to join. I'm going to show you

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,839
about the platform we developed for

365
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,200
this. Everybody's going to be getting

366
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,279
the same, uh, 10 to 15 million cells.

367
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,079
Um, and you will have to provide an

368
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,399
annotation solution. We also have a

369
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,839
challenge tied to providing solution for

370
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,000
cell spectrum and characterization

371
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,480
because these cells are not binary in

372
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,079
nature. uh and we you know there's

373
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,240
always a question of how many cells we

374
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,320
really need to profile to identify

375
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,160
unusual cell types. Now we have so many

376
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,399
cells we can answer this question of how

377
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,000
many donors technologies processing

378
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,560
modalities you need to identify all

379
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,880
predicted cell types over the last four

380
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,399
years with support from Schmidt future

381
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,560
at the broad institute we've actually

382
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,360
developed a cell annotation platform

383
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,279
this is a userfriendly interface where

384
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,320
that is meant to create explore and

385
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,480
store annotation uh we have created the

386
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
infrastructure to accumulate and analyze

387
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,440
annotation as I'm going to show you

388
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,839
we're developing um products to offer

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,079
automated annotation and it's meant to

390
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
get the community to work towards

391
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,720
understand notation. So how does it

392
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,000
work? First you need to move annotation

393
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,600
to be uh subjective to more objective

394
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
than definition. So we've defined

395
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
clearly 12 annotation metadata fields

396
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,240
that are listed here. So you go beyond

397
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,480
the cell label the full name. Uh we want

398
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,160
the canonical markers but we also want

399
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,480
the markers that you use to define a

400
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
cell type. We want to know if there's an

401
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,160
ontology term that exists or what is the

402
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,279
um closest term and these are extremely

403
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,600
well defined metadata field.

404
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,079
And this provides you the necessary

405
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,880
context to more consistently and

406
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,959
reproducibly construct atlases. But also

407
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,959
by having everybody provide these

408
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,720
annotation metadata fields, we can now

409
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,079
properly compare a contrast annotation

410
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,720
between groups and provide feedback. uh

411
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,800
for sake of time I won't do a demo but

412
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,880
um it's actually an interactive tool you

413
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,959
can do rounds of votes you can agree you

414
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,800
can disagree you can split merge

415
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,199
clusters provide your annot annotation

416
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,360
you don't need to know how to code and

417
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,000
these are the type of modules you can do

418
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,920
it's a bit like a Google doc if you wish

419
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,680
you can work in private space and invite

420
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,160
anybody you wish to work with you uh we

421
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,079
actually this is not just precomputed

422
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,519
you can actually do live compute on this

423
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,680
browser which makes this portal

424
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,360
different than other portals. And so you

425
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
could come and with our widget you could

426
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,880
actually select cells. It will recmp

427
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,279
compute gen gene expression. It will

428
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,760
recomputee marker genes for you. We can

429
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,519
do gene signatures um differential

430
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,199
expression. You can we're going to be

431
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,880
implementing automated annotation. You

432
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,880
can look at relationship between data

433
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
sets. And ultimately the goal is to have

434
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,720
the equivalent of gene card and

435
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,959
summarize annotation post um post

436
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
feedback. So this is a quick plugin. If

437
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,399
you want to hear more and see demos, do

438
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,759
reach out. Okay, I'm going to now move

439
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,120
to the more interesting part which I'm

440
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
sure is more interesting to you. But I

441
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,160
wanted to kind of plug in what we're up

442
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,040
to. So let's move to biology. And so

443
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,680
okay, we have oh all these millions of

444
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,279
cells. What can you learn from this? Uh

445
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
well of course we could try to

446
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,440
understand if there's shift in abundance

447
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,639
across disease gene programs or so much

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,279
more. And so um what did we find? These

449
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,759
are examples of analysis we can do. So

450
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,040
abundance resell context which I'm sure

451
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
it's the only vignette you want to hear

452
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,560
about. These are analysis engine

453
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,440
programs. But let me tell you a bit

454
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,199
about each. For abundance analysis again

455
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,440
this is with our path for autoimmune

456
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,720
disease broadly. Can you can we find

457
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,360
some some cell subset that shift in

458
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,680
similar way across disease? And I will

459
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,000
admit that um this is a bit generalized

460
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,720
and and one should ask me how these

461
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,720
samples were selected uh later in the

462
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
question period so I can expand on this.

463
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
So but PDC's we can see in several of

464
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,880
our severe patients are up in many of

465
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,160
these autoimmune disease are done in

466
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
many of these autoimmune disease and

467
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,120
some of it is known. So it's it's it's a

468
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,480
good way of assessing

469
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,319
um how good our pipelines are. But you

470
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,799
can also find subset we didn't know

471
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,120
about that are associated with specific

472
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,120
disease or multiple disease. So for

473
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,439
example, we could find proliferating

474
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,199
plasma cell expanded specifically in

475
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,240
lupus here in blue. I should say the

476
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,559
legend here is here on the far right. We

477
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,720
also find a new bell subset we didn't

478
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,200
know about that was specifically

479
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,520
expanded in lupus rare arthritis and

480
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,039
type 1 diabetes has very specific

481
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,520
markers. And when we look at the

482
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,840
embedding, this is this this specific

483
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,480
cluster which we know very little about

484
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,200
that was specifically associated disease

485
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,880
which we're now following up on. Um

486
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,640
I I know the script doesn't need any

487
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,400
introduction to this and so in the

488
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,400
context of autoimmune disease there's

489
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
been hundreds of low sides associated

490
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,000
with autoimmune disease. You can ask

491
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,720
very broadly what have we've learned?

492
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,400
We've learned a great deal that there's

493
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,880
a lot of the these risk varants have

494
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
very low risk relative risk associated

495
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
with them but they tend to be enriched

496
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,240
in a similar biological pathway. And so

497
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,360
the question here is what is the

498
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,440
relevant cellar context to study and you

499
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,600
know as opposed to targeting some of

500
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,520
these specific gene variants that are

501
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,440
have very small relative risk. Could we

502
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,080
think about the cellar phenotype that we

503
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,600
could be targeting instead? So how can

504
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,480
we look at this in the context of the

505
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,039
data sets we are gathering? So first you

506
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,960
know where you you obviously you collect

507
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,960
your risk variance with the highest

508
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,559
predicted effect. In this case for sake

509
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,039
of proof of principle we use those from

510
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,039
open target and we use a method

511
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,320
developed by Zang and all published in

512
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,240
nature genetics in 20 uh 2022

513
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,919
uh to identify the cell types in which

514
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,400
these variants predicted to be active

515
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,559
using what they develop being the single

516
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
cell disease relevant score. So the way

517
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,240
it works is that you assess whether a

518
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,720
given cell has excess expression level

519
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,039
of a set of positive risk variance from

520
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,720
you know any G was you wish and we use a

521
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,280
match empirical n distribution to

522
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,480
estimate the walate p value which you

523
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,640
can compute um based on the pool

524
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,840
normalized control score across all gene

525
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,240
sets. So for sake of um demo here I'm

526
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,160
can show you that we see enrichment of

527
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
some of these variants associated with

528
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,600
lupus in PDC's.

529
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,200
Now a lot of these um uh genes tied to

530
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
different disease susceptibility are not

531
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,160
independent from each other, right?

532
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,679
They're co-expressed with other genes.

533
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
So here I'm showing you some example

534
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,240
with traumatator arthritis where we look

535
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,320
at the co-expression

536
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,160
of the different risk genes and

537
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,919
identified several modules across our

538
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,679
data sets. And then we wanted to know

539
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,720
where these modules were expressed if

540
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,120
they were specific and we saw different

541
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,799
patterns. For example, if I take program

542
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,880
five, which is here, you can see it's

543
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,000
expressed across most cells. And I'm

544
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,000
going to show you more detail next

545
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
slides. If you look at program three

546
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,200
here, it's actually a little bit more

547
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,919
specific to myoid cells. And program two

548
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
here is specific to a very particular

549
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,760
cell types. And I was just going to zoom

550
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,720
in to show you. So I show I mentioned

551
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,960
program five is across all cell types

552
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,720
here. These are this is not a fine grain

553
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,120
annotation. This is just made out of the

554
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,559
pass of optimizing a framework. You have

555
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
the different cell type organized by

556
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,080
lineage and you have a dot plot. The

557
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,159
darker um the plot the bigger it is the

558
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,600
more it is expressed in a particular

559
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
program. So you can see it's expressed

560
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,480
everywhere. Program three as I show you

561
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,880
was mostly maloid. And then program two

562
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,000
is very specific to one subset we've

563
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,159
defined that had very inflammatory gene

564
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,440
program. And if you zoom in on program

565
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,760
2, which is, you know, here, it's this

566
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,400
particular subset. And it had a lot of

567
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,679
specific markers including TNF file six

568
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,120
al beta specifically expressed here just

569
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,679
to kind of show you the power of some of

570
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,600
these analyses. I may not have the

571
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,480
genotype of these patients, but I can

572
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,120
still tell you what could be uh relevant

573
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,559
here. Now I'm also interested to know if

574
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,039
there's enrichment that share across

575
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,159
multiple disease and I can do very

576
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,600
similar analysis here and in this case

577
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,440
um T-Rex comes up as being enriched for

578
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,440
these susceptibility variants across all

579
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,880
disease. I can you know here I'm showing

580
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,760
some of these different disease some of

581
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,799
these key genes that are up across let's

582
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,320
say lupus type 1 diabetes and RA and I

583
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,919
can find some of these genes driving

584
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,400
these analysis including some some of

585
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,200
these key ISGs interferons so many genes

586
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,200
and I can look at where they land in the

587
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,799
context of our embedding not only do

588
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,880
they land in the T-Rex they actually

589
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,360
land into a very particular subset of

590
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,039
T-Rex that we didn't know about and so

591
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,799
it helps us hone in on to know what's

592
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,640
that subset we should be doing some

593
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,200
follow-up studies on. So I'm showing you

594
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,400
some of the key genes here. As I

595
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
mentioned, none of this is published,

596
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
but we're sharing this so that we're

597
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,559
hoping to motivate the community to

598
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,720
embrace on these tools. And finally,

599
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,120
I'll skip TCR for sake of time, but gene

600
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,480
program very quickly. So many different

601
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,400
ways of looking at gene programs. I'm

602
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,840
going to show you one vignette using

603
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
consensus non- negative metrics

604
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,520
factorization or CNMF here where we're

605
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,520
going we're trying to define gene

606
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,240
modules that are tied to both cellar

607
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,159
identity and factor activities. I'm I'm

608
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,600
using the maloid cell as my example

609
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,280
here. And so, you know, as we try to map

610
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,240
the activities across different cell

611
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,840
type, it's I'm oversimplifying it, but a

612
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,840
combination between these programs that

613
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,320
are going to be tied to it the true cell

614
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,799
identity. Yeah.

615
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,880
And those that are tied to its activity

616
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,200
and and so in terms of this true

617
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,400
identity, um I'm showing you these

618
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
different programs. These are micro

619
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
genes that define these cell types. not

620
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,480
shocking but we are interested in the

621
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,120
gene programs that are tied to function

622
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,919
that across many many subsets and so for

623
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,919
example we find these IHG program in IG4

624
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
disease lupus lupus pediatric which is

625
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,000
known but you know how I told you about

626
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,159
these I1 beta monocytes when they

627
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,760
actually come up as a gene program and

628
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,400
you can actually find them specifically

629
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,799
in IG4 litis and other disease so that's

630
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,120
another way of kind of coming together

631
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,200
so to summarize

632
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,039
uh I showed you some generalized

633
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,880
strategies ies to define share and

634
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,880
distinct programs. We finalized

635
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,679
integration of these 20 million cells

636
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,880
and we're actually using the other 20 20

637
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,480
million cells we have to see how

638
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,799
generalizable our findings are. We've

639
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,159
developed the cell annotation platform.

640
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,679
I've mostly went uh over it but if you

641
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
want to hear more about it do reach out

642
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
to me. I've shown you that with our

643
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,640
framework we can find shift and

644
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,640
abundance that are sharing across

645
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,400
disease. We can find sort of context

646
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,559
with susceptibility genes. I didn't

647
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,559
cover the TCR, but we can also find TCR

648
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,240
share cross disease along with share

649
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,919
programs and so you can imagine what

650
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,760
we're going to be doing next. If you're

651
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,080
interested about the annotation jam, do

652
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,760
reach out and we're going to be

653
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,760
releasing all our code on GitHub. So if

654
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,919
some of it is useful to you, I'll be

655
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,000
delighted to team up. Um, and finally, I

656
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,320
tried to show pictures of the amazing

657
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,159
team that has been involved. This is my

658
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,039
partner in crime, Gary Reynolds, for

659
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,880
doing this, the Salation Platform team.

660
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,880
uh the whole lab actually more than half

661
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,640
the lab is working on this the funders

662
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,000
and more importantly the patients and

663
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,520
their family none of which would be

664
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,440
possible it wouldn't be possible to do

665
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,919
this work without their partnerships

666
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,919
thank you for your attention

667
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,279
Is this this?

668
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,279
>> Yeah, this is working.

669
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:52,000
>> Okay, good. Um, I'm I'm interested in

670
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,760
how you in the you started out by saying

671
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,880
you are your assumption is there's a

672
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,840
finite number of cell programs. So I

673
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,559
wonder with the current atlas you have

674
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,720
with with about 30 million cells how

675
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:09,840
close are you to being able to estimate

676
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,480
sort of the number of potential find

677
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,240
um that fined number and how does it

678
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,320
change in terms of look when you compare

679
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
it across ances if you look across

680
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,840
ancestries

681
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
>> yeah that's

682
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,279
>> and perturbations and stuff

683
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,760
>> that is a good uh question so I should

684
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,159
say um south subset I don't know about

685
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,080
the sal programs until we model

686
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,080
And so we wanted to know after how many

687
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,880
disease do we stop seeing new cell

688
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,559
subset emerge because we you know if you

689
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,840
start grouping other types of disease at

690
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,760
some point there's only so many cell

691
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,679
subset you can identify and we can

692
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,720
downsample our data sets to see when we

693
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,960
start saturating and only in the context

694
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,080
of of course what I presented which is

695
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,440
infectious autoimmune disease normal

696
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,880
pediatric and adult I didn't mention

697
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,880
this we have pediatric and adult that

698
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
are all non-treated

699
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,480
then we don't see more signal of course

700
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,240
once you prepost treatment is a

701
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,039
different story. You're completely

702
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,960
correct in terms of ancestry. Uh as we

703
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,440
add more ancestry, we may see a bit more

704
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,279
diversity. I didn't cover this, but we

705
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,159
actually have representative samples

706
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,080
from uh almost everywhere in the world,

707
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,559
but we definitely are skewed towards

708
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,039
Caucasian. So, the next iteration will

709
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,640
actually add another 3,000 samples from

710
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,799
South America and 2,000 samples from um

711
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,520
Africa. That will help with this. And

712
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,200
then we'll be able to estimate Great.

713
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,679
Thank you, Ben.

714
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,200
>> Lovely talk, Chloe. Um, my questions on

715
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,400
the cell annotation and particularly how

716
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,240
you're dealing with the sort of uh

717
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,679
subset of transcripts that you're

718
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
actually sampling in the single cell

719
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,320
technologies because as I understand it,

720
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,039
we're getting maybe 15 to 25% of the

721
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,679
transcripts per cell. And I noticed in

722
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,760
your sort of flowcharts there were

723
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,760
required genes for cell identity. But

724
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,240
given the amount of missing data, do you

725
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,279
worry about annotation problems cropping

726
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,960
up there or is the kind of overwhelming

727
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,080
bulk of the data sufficient to still get

728
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
you to the right place?

729
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,360
>> That's a good I love that question Neil.

730
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,240
So first I should mention that for

731
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,080
vessel annotation we also added over 200

732
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,080
surface protein because imologists love

733
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,919
surface protein and that's how you can

734
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,799
relate the gene signature to surface

735
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,200
protein and relate the legacy knowledge.

736
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,880
We've also included TR and BCR data

737
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,720
because it can help identify specific T

738
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,120
cell subsets. Now of course if you look

739
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,640
at one cell at a time in human data

740
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,520
you're right that we're capturing you

741
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,760
know 1500 to 2,000 genes. Some of it is

742
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,440
is dropout but some of it is also you're

743
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,440
looking at primary cells. So at any time

744
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
in point in time you don't express all

745
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,360
genes and so once we've defined you know

746
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,760
groups of cell with similar features

747
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,840
that you think have unique identity you

748
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,400
actually can do pseudob and that then

749
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,799
then you capture a lot more genes and so

750
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,159
like that's a that's a way around it and

751
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,679
then the single cell community is

752
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,600
already doing a lot of annotation. is

753
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,159
all over the place. And so there's a

754
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,720
there's a need to start like agreeing

755
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,000
like maybe you and I would call the same

756
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,520
cells two different ways, but it'd be

757
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,799
great to know that we're calling the

758
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,640
same cells to different ways. We can

759
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,919
build that catalog of synonyms and

760
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,559
that's kind of what this platform will

761
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,559
also help us get to. Yeah.

762
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,200
>> Great. We'll have one final question.

763
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,520
This

764
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,760
>> Oh, thank you. Um Chloe, this is

765
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,600
amazing. The what what you've built is s

766
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,919
such a service for the community. I

767
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,520
wanted to ask you about multiomics. So

768
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,080
some of these data sets also have

769
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,840
attack. How's the HCA thinking about

770
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,679
incorporating attack because it would be

771
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,440
incredibly useful to build a similar

772
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,000
resource and leverage your cell type

773
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,120
annotation platforms for for attack.

774
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,720
>> Yeah. So uh the the CAP can be adapted

775
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,039
to any species and any modality. And

776
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
then in terms of HG and multiomics,

777
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,559
we're all for it. You know we the reason

778
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,760
you saw so many single cell is that we

779
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,679
had to start with the modality that was

780
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,760
most out there and most scalable and

781
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,600
cost effective and you know a lot of it

782
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,080
was single cell with with protein which

783
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,480
I didn't disclose in TCR there's not

784
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,080
that many multimodel data set out there

785
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,480
and I think it's also tied to the cost

786
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,320
of generating such data at scale uh we

787
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,399
are actually integrating such data set

788
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,960
but to be completely honest it's a very

789
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,640
small percentage of the of the data and

790
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,720
as part of HT 2.0 I know that's now

791
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,480
being launched. One of the pillar is to

792
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,919
push for multiomics and trying to find

793
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,000
partnerships with industries so we can

794
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,720
drop the cost but it may make more sense

795
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,200
to kind of push such effort on very

796
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,960
specific contexts or disease or cell

797
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,480
subsets where we actually need to map

798
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,159
the regulatory landscape and this is

799
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,080
where partnership with this community

800
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,480
could kind of help synergize such

801
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,279
effort. Thank you for welcoming me.

802
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,520
Thank you for your time.

803
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,520
>> Thanks Chloe.

804
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,380
[Applause]
