1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,792
I make a joke

2
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:01,751
that sometimes I feel

3
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:02,794
like the Sloan Fellows

4
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,797
program, it's the mid-career crisis.

5
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,175
Most of us, we were already doing well.

6
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,802
We had good jobs, good salaries,

7
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,803
good opportunities.

8
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,596
there was no need to come here

9
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,265
to get a good job.

10
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,266
The reason to come here

11
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,102
is to actually have a stop.

12
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,770
To reflect on everything,

13
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,230
reassess, understand

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,815
who you are, where you want to be

15
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,442
and how you're going to get there.

16
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,151
During this year,

17
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,612
I have built up much more self-awareness.

18
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:30,864
I felt like I just didn't know

19
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,323
that much about myself.

20
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,742
You’re just, like, on the go.

21
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,325
You’re just like

22
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,827
keep going then the projects done.

23
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,997
You get one task done after another.

24
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,748
This program

25
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,248
just, like,

26
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,708
helped me to learn

27
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,084
so much more about myself,

28
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,461
my own blindspots.

29
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,170
I had grew

30
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,214
a lot in my career learning by doing.

31
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,300
But I felt that

32
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,261
there was a lot of firefighting

33
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,097
as opposed to a bigger perspective,

34
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,641
a bigger strategy around

35
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,642
how to do things.

36
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,561
MIT is not just being here

37
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,438
and take classes. MIT is

38
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,774
being here and having conversations

39
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,400
with all types of people,

40
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,027
different programs, the

41
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,487
entrepreneurship ecosystem,

42
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,490
the engineering school, the undergrad,

43
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,949
the events.

44
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,826
It's a whole thing.

45
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,369
Being surrounded

46
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:18,870
by people

47
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,080
that are actually

48
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,831
looking for ways

49
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,625
to change the world

50
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,336
and make the world a better place, it's

51
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,629
exactly what I needed.

52
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,005
It's not just what we’ve

53
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,799
learned over the last 12 months,

54
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,841
but how do you apply that

55
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,051
with the people that you do

56
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,968
daily life with?

57
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,677
How do I take what

58
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,679
I've learned out to my friends,

59
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,098
to my sphere of influence,

60
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,433
to my workplace, to my family?

61
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,018
So that, you know,

62
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,520
I can have an impact on people.

63
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,187
Being here

64
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,438
gave me the opportunity

65
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,524
to learn something I didn't know before.

66
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,942
Change my mindset,

67
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,568
how you spot opportunities,

68
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,946
how you understand the technology

69
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,907
to solve for these, let's say,

70
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,118
big problems in the world

71
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,786
and how to combine that.

72
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,496
Before coming here,

73
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,456
I would have never had that mindset.

74
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,707
For me it was very important

75
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,710
that my MBA was not just about

76
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,547
what I could get from the classroom,

77
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,882
but actually what I could get from people

78
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,509
that were actually more experienced

79
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,051
than me.

80
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,719
The best thing I got out of

81
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,012
this is people.

82
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,472
I have lifelong friends

83
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,475
that I met here that will literally be

84
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,309
my best friends

85
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,435
through the rest of my life.

86
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,395
They come from

87
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,396
such different backgrounds,

88
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,730
such different experience,

89
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,191
but yet they are all so humble

90
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,192
and want to work

91
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,402
and want to make

92
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,611
a good impact on the world.

93
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,863
When I came here

94
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,614
and I started to know people

95
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,741
from literally around the world,

96
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,702
it was amazing

97
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,622
learning how to prepare different dishes

98
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,790
around the world,

99
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,626
how to learn small words

100
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,211
in different languages,

101
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,630
but also the lifestyle

102
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,091
and the way of think and the way of work.

103
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,469
Having this experience of diversity, it’s been

104
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,807
meaningful and helpful for my future.

105
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,976
The most key takeaway

106
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,477
of this whole experience,

107
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,896
aside from the academic

108
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,315
and amazing experience being here at MIT,

109
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,318
is that building of community

110
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,277
and network

111
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,528
that you get to keep

112
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,946
forever, and it's yours.

113
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,156
No one can take that away from you.
