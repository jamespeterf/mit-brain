1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,200
why is so difficult to build a computer

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,399
vision system well an image is made of

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,280
pixels when we look at a picture what we

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,639
see are shapes and objects that we

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,880
immediately recognize however what a

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,639
machine gets is a collection of numbers

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,400
where each pixel is represented just by

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,199
a single number and we want to build a

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,519
system that will tell us whether there

10
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,800
is a car or not in that image so the

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,359
first thing that we need to do is to

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,480
collect the training data and we will

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,960
need some images that contains examples

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,000
of cars so that the machine can learn

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,720
all the different ways in which a car

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
car might look like and then we also

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,680
need examples of images without cars

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,399
once we have built this data set the

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,280
final thing that we need is the learning

20
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,039
model neural networks are the way in

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,200
which we build those systems they are

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,440
composed of very simple units that are

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,680
interconnected with adjustable weights

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,199
and we will use all those images to set

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,920
up the strength of the connections

26
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,120
between the units so that the neural

27
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,000
network learns to solve the test that we

28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,879
care about for more MIT moments from MIT
