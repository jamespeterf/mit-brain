1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,919
Next, I'd like to welcome, it's a

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,719
pleasure to introduce co, excuse me,

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,480
Corey Walrip of Sublime Systems. Sublime

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,799
Systems is transforming data center

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
infrastructure by developing lowcarbon

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,720
cement solutions that reduce emissions

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,640
and support more sustainable, energy

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,920
efficient facility construction.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,640
Welcome, Corey.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,720
>> Thanks, everyone. Uh, thanks Trisha. Um,

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
happy to be here at this event. Um, we

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,000
are a company that actually came out of

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,480
MIT. So we spun out in 2020. Um came out

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
of uh Professor Ying Changeng's lab. Um

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,040
and our co-founders are Leia and Yet um

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,559
and Leia was a at that time she was a

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,360
member of the lab at at Inette's lab. Um

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,520
so we uh are commercializing a

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,160
technology that produces uh lowcarbon

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,160
cement uh for um the data center

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,520
industry as long as well as many other

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,320
industries. So why does that matter?

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,520
cement um as a whole uh produces about

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,119
8% of global CO2 emissions. Um one ton

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
of the ordinary Portland cement that's

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,439
produced today represents about one ton

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,119
of CO2. When you put this in perspective

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,119
in the data center industry, if you look

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,280
at a lot of the hyperscalers um and

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,960
their um emissions profiles and their

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
sustainability reports over the past few

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,720
years, most of those increased emissions

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,479
are coming from the capital goods

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,320
category. as they build more and more of

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,400
these data centers, their capital goods,

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,400
the emissions from those capital goods

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,799
um are increasing exponentially and

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,720
that's coming from steel and concrete.

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,479
So, we're providing a a solution here

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,880
that can address the emissions related

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,960
to the physical materials um that go

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
into these data centers. Our

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,040
breakthrough technology of course avoids

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,280
CO2 and I'll get more into the metrics

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,200
um that around that. Um so, we are not

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
providing any sort of carbon capture. We

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,439
are avoiding the emissions at the

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,600
source. um we are able to achieve cost

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,000
parity when we produce our materials at

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,000
the existing scale of uh industrial

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,240
cement production. Um we're also

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
producing a better cement um in terms of

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,159
durability features and aesthetic

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
qualities. Um we are a more

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,840
energyefficient process and in the

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
process of making our cement blends

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,160
we're also unlocking additional critical

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,040
minerals in terms of magnesium um

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,879
aluminum materials um and and also iron

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
products.

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,920
So uh fundamentally what Sublime is

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
doing is replacing the uh the existing

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,760
process for ordinary Portland cement

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,920
production which takes limestone which

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,239
is a carbonate material and then you put

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
that limestone in a rotary kil which is

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
fired at very high temperatures by coal

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
or natural gas. So you're getting two

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,319
sources of emissions the limestone

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
decomposition and then the use of fossil

71
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,000
fuels in that kiln. Sublime is taking a

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
different approach which is a low

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
temperature process that uses

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
non-carbonate materials. So when we use

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,160
clean electricity, we are basically

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,000
removing both emission sources from the

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,480
production of cement. The product that

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,640
we're producing is a drop-in hydraulic

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,239
cement. So this this material is is a

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
cement powder just like you would use in

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,319
the construction industry today. And it

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
can store, pour, and perform just like

83
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,159
ordinary Portland cement. So it drops

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
into the existing construction value

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,480
chain. And ultimately when it's mixed

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,720
with aggregates and water it forms the

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,360
same calcium silicate hydrate harden

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,200
phase that existing concrete uh uses

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
today.

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
So uh what's most important uh the

91
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,920
reason why I joined the company uh and

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,400
and many of the folks at Sublime um are

93
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,000
are still here is because of this uh we

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
have the potential to be able to produce

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
a cement um that is over 90% uh

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,879
decarbonized versus today's Portland

97
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
cement. Um this is a step change in

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,760
terms of what uh any other technology um

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,760
could produce um outside of you know

100
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,200
giant carbon capture installations on

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,440
existing cement production.

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,440
So we've uh scaled up quite quickly over

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,799
the past uh 5 years. Uh as mentioned we

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,799
started in a lab at MIT um at R&D scale.

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
Um we've now been operating our pilot

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
facility which is just located down the

107
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,000
road um in in Somerville um for the past

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,400
three years um where we produce material

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,920
for internal testing, external testing

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,319
and then also product demonstration

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,480
pores which I'll talk about. Um we're in

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
the process of in final engineering

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,880
design and expect to break ground on our

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
first commercial facility um which will

115
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,199
uh which is expected to be operational

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,680
in 2028. This will be in uh western

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
Massachusetts in Holio. Uh and this will

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
eliminate much of the scale up risk

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,240
associated with our product and uh and

120
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,080
the process technology. Um lastly, we'll

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
scale up to the full industrial scale.

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,400
So we call these mega plants or megaton

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,400
scale plants about 1 million tons of

124
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,280
cement produced per year. Um and we

125
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,160
expect those in the 2030 plus 2030 plus

126
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,280
time frame. Uh we are partnered with

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,520
some of the largest uh strategic cement

128
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,840
players in the world. So, Amise, CR, and

129
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,000
wholesome um partnered in terms of a

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,120
deal that provides uh offtake for our

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
materials. It also provides uh a a

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,000
partnership framework to be able to

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,400
build those full-scale plants in

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
coordination with them.

135
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
And we are also working directly with

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,320
the data center industry. So earlier

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,479
this year, we signed a binding forward

138
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,080
offtake agreement uh to to provide

139
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,039
material as well as environmental

140
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,360
attributes to Microsoft. Um so this uh

141
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,919
spans the material produced at our first

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,160
two commercial facilities. The facility

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,479
was mentioned in Holio, Massachusetts as

144
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,720
well as our first full-scale production.

145
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,240
Um so we're very uh looking very much

146
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
looking forward to being able to be a

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,560
supplier to the data center industry at

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,840
mass scale and we're repeating the same

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,800
agreement template with other

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,320
hyperscalers and data center developers.

151
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
Ultimately what's most important is

152
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
getting our material in the ground. Uh

153
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,919
we've done that with the material from

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
our pilot facility over the past few

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,400
years. So starting at a at the slab um

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,479
and then moving all the way to a data

157
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,240
center loading dock. So we are

158
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
specifically working in the data center

159
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,400
industry um with construction

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,639
contractors with developers and the

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
hyperscalers themselves. Uh and so you

162
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
can see our most recent applications um

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
are in different applications that you

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
might see in a data center. Eventually

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
of course we'll be moving to this lab on

166
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
grade application that would be um you

167
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,160
know underpinning uh most of the racks

168
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,240
uh where all these GPUs are sitting.

169
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,680
So uh very much looking forward to

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,440
conversing with you all after the

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
presentation later on and learning about

172
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,120
how we could partner with you all in

173
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,199
terms of building uh these data these

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,880
infrastructure uh that this data center

175
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,880
rely these data centers rely on. Thank

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
you.
