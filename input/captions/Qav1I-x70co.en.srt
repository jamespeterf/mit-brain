1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,240
think uh okay yeah an area we've been uh

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,879
doing research on for uh for the past

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,120
few years which is the orbital carrying

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,960
capacity and space sustainability

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,040
implications now this this topic has

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,760
implications for Space Traffic

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,199
management orbital debris and so I'll

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,720
cover a lot of those as well so before I

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,519
get there I want to talk about my

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,439
research group uh here at MIT and the

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,640
areas that we cover uh so these are the

12
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,679
four sort of groupings of areas we

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,200
definitely cover a lot of topics um in

14
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,200
our work at MIT so space sustainability

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,879
has been a key uh Focus area we actually

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,800
started working on this back in 2018 um

17
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,399
before this really came to the Limelight

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,120
with NASA's renewed focus on Space

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,840
sustainability and some of the new

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,719
international efforts on Space

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,879
sustainability uh we do a lot of work in

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
understanding space weather in

23
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,800
particular the effects of space weather

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,079
on on orbit assets satellites um and how

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,120
satellites are impacted by space weather

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,840
Space Traffic management is becoming

27
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,640
more and more important we've done a lot

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,479
of work on coordinating large satellite

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,360
constellations and understanding the

30
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,680
Space Traffic management constraints

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,520
when you have constellations that are

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,360
occupying nearby orbits and finally my

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,439
group is is well known for space

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,560
situational awareness and fundamental

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,320
astrodynamics so in that topic area

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,479
we're really focused on uh understanding

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,280
what's on orbit the algorithms and

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,520
processes for taking observational data

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,000
and converting that into an a detailed

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,759
understanding of the objects that are on

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,759
orbit and we also do fundamental

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,040
astrodynamics which is the fun stuff so

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
the applied math of orbital mechanics

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,600
here's a picture of my group uh we have

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,079
about seven students for posts uh spread

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,000
across these these four areas so with

47
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,439
that I want to motivate the talk for

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,439
today with this with this uh movie and

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,520
essentially what you're seeing here are

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,280
some projected and some that have become

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,039
reality of the future Space Traffic that

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,719
we're expecting over the next uh 10 to

53
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,840
30 years so for example a low earth

54
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,680
orbit population has more than doubled a

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,640
lot of that has to do with the starlink

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,759
constellation that at the moment is

57
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,959
above 7,000 satellites in orbit uh

58
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,319
beyond that there are other

59
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,400
constellations that want to uh basically

60
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,160
access similar commercial opportunities

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,080
to starlink such as Kyper constellation

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,879
and other uh constellations such as one

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,239
web and um Boeing and their

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,000
constellation so this picture is looking

65
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,360
fairly crowded there's going to be a lot

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,840
of activity up there

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,760
and we're going to be operating in lowth

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,680
orbit at a a level of satellite activity

69
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,879
that we've never seen before so this is

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,280
hopefully a a promising future but is

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,000
causing some concerns and some of those

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,879
concerns we've known about for a while

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,599
here's Hollywood's take on the orbital

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,400
debris problem of course this is the um

75
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,920
um the movie uh that Hollywood created

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,680
uh to discuss the Kesler effect so this

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,480
is the Gravity movie and a lot of the

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,080
details here in that in that uh sequence

79
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,560
are not physically uh are not physically

80
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,440
um accurate but the idea that orbital

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,959
debris might become an issue and might

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,120
threaten um crude space flight um is

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,840
actually a re a real um risk so there's

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,360
an effect that we know in the community

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,519
called the Kesler effect where

86
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,920
potentially in the future we might have

87
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,000
the density of debris in low of orbit

88
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,959
reach a critical point and once it

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,200
reaches that critical point collisions

90
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,599
are going to lead to subsequent

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,560
collisions and we might have this

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,280
catastrophic Cascade in low earth orbit

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,840
and that could render u space activities

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,599
potentially infeasible or more or less

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,400
just very difficult um so we want to

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,280
kind of prevent this future in lowth

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,159
orbit and so governments are concerned

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,480
about these space sustainability issues

99
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,920
so we had recently NASA release a space

100
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,560
sustainability strategy volume one um

101
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,560
and NASA's planned to release subsequent

102
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,439
uh documents on Space sustainability and

103
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,280
there efforts but also the FCC has

104
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:08,360
issued the first fine for a debris event

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,840
so um dish uh satellite network was

106
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,680
fined about

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,439
$150,000 for a debris generation event

108
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,959
FCC also changed some of the rules

109
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:20,000
around orbital debris in particular NASA

110
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,680
had this precedent this rule that uh

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,520
they expected owner operators to remove

112
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,560
defunct satellites within 25 years of

113
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,479
mission um end and so FCC has updated

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,039
that recently from 25 years to 5 years

115
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,560
um a lot of these rules a lot of these

116
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:38,320
efforts and that's not just in the US um

117
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,400
there's an effort in the UK focus on

118
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,759
Space sustainability and Issa has

119
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,720
established a zero debris Charter where

120
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,199
they're hoping that companies sign on to

121
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,919
this Charter and um basically agree to

122
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,039
generate zero debris or uh work towards

123
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,000
that goal so governments want to do

124
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,039
something before it's too late but the

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,160
issue that we're seeing within our group

126
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:00,600
and uh more broadly is that there aren't

127
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,840
hard numbers

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,880
and there there aren't hard physics

129
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,440
behind some of these initiatives so what

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,320
we hope to do and what I want to share

131
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,080
with you today is we've been developing

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,880
this tool at MIT called mocat and mocat

133
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,240
stands for the MIT orbital Capacity

134
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,440
Analysis tool and we hope to change that

135
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,080
we hope to put hard numbers Behind these

136
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
calculations and some hard physics for

137
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,720
example the 5-year

138
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,319
rule um it's still unclear like what the

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,240
physical

140
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,880
um uh result there um that motivates

141
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,800
that five-year Rule and a lot of this is

142
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,160
really um the governments want to do

143
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,199
something they're concerned and they're

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,759
trying to get ahead of the problem so

145
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
one of the the efforts that we took on

146
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,919
at MIT is we've released this open

147
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,039
source orbital capacity tool made that

148
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,240
available to the public and so one of

149
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,120
the concerns that we saw is that there

150
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,800
are various um orbital debris modeling

151
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,160
tools out there they exist but a lot of

152
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
them are closed source and they're

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,000
difficult to replicate and so the issue

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,080
with that is this can lead to a muddle

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,400
debate where operators are not sure of

156
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,880
whether or not they are going to lead to

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
a more sustainable lowth orbit or you

158
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,319
know whether or not they should believe

159
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,479
the results coming out of these closed

160
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,599
Source tools so one of the efforts that

161
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,240
we took on at MIT is to develop an open

162
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,840
source tool where all of the assumptions

163
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,919
in our approach can be uh scrutinized

164
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,680
and basically anyone can see what what

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,080
assumptions we're using and our tool um

166
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,000
was a large software project and in

167
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,160
essence has the same capability as some

168
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,479
of these tools that are um owned and

169
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,960
operated by uh Nations so at the oecd

170
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,880
meeting last year uh we we released this

171
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,680
tool this is the oecd space forum and

172
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,400
mocad really has two components and I'll

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,120
talk about both of them today one

174
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,560
component is is this link here and if

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,599
you want you can um on your laptop or on

176
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,360
your phone actually go and download it

177
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,759
right now and if you go to this link you

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,080
can actually run the simulations of of

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,879
one of our tools uh so these two links

180
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,919
one is the mocat uh MC tool Theon Carlo

181
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,479
tool the other one is a sour syc

182
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,440
modeling tool so that's one of the

183
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,639
efforts that we're taking on at MIT and

184
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,759
here's some of the results that we get

185
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,160
from some of these tools so for example

186
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,160
on the left is a simulation with no

187
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,639
future launches so what we're seeing in

188
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,000
a simulation is what if we um stop

189
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,000
launching new satellites so our space

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,280
economy basically disappears and um the

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,280
things that are up there are up there

192
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,039
they're not going to be disposed of uh

193
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,680
what does the environment look like and

194
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,120
even under this scenario and it's it's

195
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,919
hard to see uh the red are debris and

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,639
the blue BL and the green are um intact

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,000
payloads but if you wait till this uh

198
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,360
movie starts over you can see there's a

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
lot of green initially and what happens

200
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,960
is we're not launching any additional

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,759
satellites so all of those green intact

202
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,919
payloads because of natural um decay of

203
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,960
their orbits are going to deorbit fairly

204
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,199
quickly but what's also going to happen

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,080
is that all the debris that's up there

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
is going to generate all of the

207
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,039
subsequent collisions and it's going to

208
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,159
grow over time so if we stop launching

209
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,039
today we're still going to see a growth

210
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,840
of space debris over time but but an

211
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,440
important part that we're um sort of

212
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,720
trying to highlight with our work is

213
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,360
it's it's really critical to know where

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,360
that growth and debris is going to

215
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,000
happen because that's going to affect

216
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,000
the solution that you use to solve this

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,560
problem and on the right here what we're

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,560
showing is if you take all of these

219
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,680
future plan constellations under FCC

220
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,520
filings of what uh companies and owner

221
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,360
operators intend to do and we model that

222
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,000
forward this is what the space debris

223
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,640
population looks like and see here you

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,080
can see that initially um it really

225
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,760
starts with the same simulation as the

226
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,279
left initially there's not that many

227
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,080
Green Dots but dramatically the number

228
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,800
of these Green Dots increases because of

229
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,640
the Space Traffic that I discussed

230
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,519
before and then after this space traffic

231
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,720
gets fairly green soon after we see a

232
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,240
very large growth in orbital debris

233
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,760
because this increased Space Traffic

234
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,279
means that there's going to be more

235
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,839
space activity and more debris

236
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,399
generation events but the the thing I

237
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,600
want to highlight here is two twofold

238
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,440
one these simulations the the pixels

239
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,839
that we're showing for active satellite

240
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,399
and orbital debris they're exaggerated

241
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,880
obviously right so they're exaggerated

242
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,440
so you could see them um so we want a a

243
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,120
disclaimer they're not to scale of what

244
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,040
the sizes of the satellites are the

245
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,959
other thing is it really depends on the

246
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,640
altitude it depends on the location and

247
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,560
what I hope to do with this talk is

248
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,480
really uh tease out all of those nuances

249
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,320
for you okay so let's start from square

250
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,920
one that's the end result that we're

251
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,000
going to get to and then in square one

252
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,079
what are the multiple factors that

253
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,880
constrain orbital capacity why can't we

254
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,640
operate an infinite number of satellites

255
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,959
in LOF orbit what constrains the problem

256
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,600
well here are some of them and I think

257
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,959
this list is pretty exhaustive I might

258
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,079
be missing one or two but I think this

259
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,800
is a pretty good list uh there are about

260
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:55,160
six factors in in our in our opinion

261
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,880
that constrains this um orbital activity

262
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,079
on the left we have Spectrum there's not

263
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,560
an unlimited um Spectrum for the

264
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,200
satellites to broadcast signals from

265
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,800
space of course there might be some

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,079
Technical Solutions that you can use um

267
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,800
to come around that um light pollution

268
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,720
so we've heard if anyone's following um

269
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,720
a lot of this in in the media we've

270
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,240
heard that telescopes are uh becoming

271
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,399
inundated with uh light pollution from

272
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,560
starlink so that's an issue so the more

273
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,640
satellites we launch in lowth orbit and

274
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,120
in particular their reflectivity it

275
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,120
could affect our groundbase

276
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,240
observatories and then Ali mentioned

277
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,200
this um earlier but admissions so for

278
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,120
example if we're mostly making

279
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,920
satellites out of aluminum which is the

280
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,800
case and those satellites are going to

281
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,560
deorbit at a fairly High rate if we're

282
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,920
launching uh 2,000 satellites per year

283
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,000
with a mission life of 5 years you can

284
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,440
do the numbers that's a that's about a

285
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,399
thousand uh the orbits that we're going

286
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,959
to see per year thousand satellites

287
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,160
coming back in the atmosphere that's

288
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,720
going to deposit a lot of aluminum and

289
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,440
on the right they're volume constraints

290
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,320
these satellites can occupy the same

291
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,959
space right so they they have some

292
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,920
volume constraints their operational

293
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,399
constraints as well as the numbers grow

294
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,880
dramatically there are going to be more

295
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,880
collision avoidance Maneuvers and

296
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,920
someone's going to have to play the

297
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,959
traffic cop if the numbers get really

298
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,639
really large this can be become

299
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,680
something that an individual person

300
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,760
can't do so managing the maneuvers of

301
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,480
7,000 satellites which starlink

302
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,120
currently does can't be done manually it

303
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,279
has to be done automatically and we know

304
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,839
that starlink does that automatic

305
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,040
collision avoidance and then finally the

306
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,720
long-term environmental constraints so

307
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,560
these are all the issues and they they

308
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,360
bind over capacity in in different ways

309
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,480
our group we focus on are the issues on

310
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,800
the right there's work being done at MIT

311
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,440
on the issues on the left um Dan

312
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,680
Hastings and his group is working on

313
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,279
admissions uh Carrie Cy and her group

314
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,519
are working on light pollution and um Ed

315
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
Crawley and his group are working on

316
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,800
Spectrum so I I feel like confidently

317
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,839
saying that a lot of these topics are

318
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,720
covered at MIT but my group specifically

319
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,040
we just focus on these three so let's

320
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,320
talk about those three topics um and and

321
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,440
I like to think about those three in in

322
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,279
these two ways on the right there's this

323
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,480
term that we've coined recently we call

324
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,560
it intrinsic capacity really what you

325
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,639
want to think about this this term as is

326
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,000
the Space Traffic management issues so

327
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,959
we know that even if we knew perfectly

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,519
where all the satellites were we still

329
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,760
have to avoid collisions we need to make

330
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,160
sure that those satellites in their

331
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,120
orbits don't intersect what happens

332
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,920
naturally on orbit is because of the

333
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,040
pertubations some of them atmospheric

334
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,240
pertubations some of them gravitational

335
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,839
perations the orbits are not perfectly

336
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,600
maintained they Decay over time and if

337
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,000
you don't uh perform collision avoidance

338
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,760
Maneuvers that can lead to collisions so

339
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,880
there's this intrinsic capacity issue

340
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,320
that we focus on in our group and if

341
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,160
you've ever heard of the mathematical

342
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,360
problem the sphere packing problem in

343
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,160
mathematics um essentially like how many

344
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,680
spheres can you fit in a volume think

345
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,399
about this as an orbit packing problem

346
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,480
you have these spheres which are the

347
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,920
keep out regions for satellites that are

348
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,560
orbiting under the laws of kar and

349
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,079
Newton and we want to understand how

350
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,360
many of those spheres can we uh safely

351
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,959
operate in lowth orbit but this picture

352
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,040
is very pristine and doesn't include

353
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,760
orbital debris in order for us to

354
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,639
include orbital debris we have to model

355
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,079
all of these probabilistic events of

356
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,720
course operators don't want to generate

357
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,320
debris their goal is not to gener

358
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,920
generate debris but we can't Design

359
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,639
Systems with a zero probability of

360
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,760
failure there's going to be a non-zero

361
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,680
probability that these systems are going

362
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,880
to fail and maybe operate in an

363
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,519
unintended way and those could lead to

364
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,680
debris and in terms of doing this

365
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,480
calculation on the right we have to do

366
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,160
it in the probabilistic fashion which is

367
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,360
um what are the probabilities that we're

368
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,399
going to have uh satellites St failed

369
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,399
and what are the probabilities that

370
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,480
those satellites are going to generate

371
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,519
debris we in some cases you might have

372
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,800
explosions batteries on board explode um

373
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,160
launch Vehicles explode we really don't

374
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,639
design them to do that but they do do

375
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,959
that with some small probability and so

376
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,199
these are really two different ways of

377
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,240
thinking about orbital capacity and the

378
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,839
binding one from our work we've shown

379
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,360
that this really is a binding uh orbital

380
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,440
cap capacity notion this is what's

381
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,480
limiting us this random debris

382
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,959
generation but the one on the left also

383
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
limits us as you if you go to and you

384
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,279
look at the FCC filings there are a lot

385
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,920
of really popular orbits so starlink

386
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,000
occupies the 550 kilm orbit and that's

387
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,600
for a reason and the reason for that is

388
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,800
if you go any lower you need a lot of

389
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,160
satellites to ensure that you have the

390
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,839
the right number of satellites overhead

391
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,959
right if you go any higher then you're

392
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:29,959
well outside of the atmosphere so your

393
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,680
debris uh concerns get and Amplified so

394
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,600
there's this goil log zone of where

395
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,560
satellites want to operate and in that

396
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,240
zone you really care about

397
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,800
this all right so what what how do we

398
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,480
model this probabilistic uh Behavior so

399
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,079
one of the one of these models is called

400
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,519
a sore sync model and it it might be

401
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,759
very familiar to something that you've

402
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,040
already seen so if you've ever seen

403
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,480
results from an epidemiological model

404
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,440
such as the models that we had during

405
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,399
covid that were modeling disease and

406
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,839
infected individuals and these are

407
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,160
populationbased models um if you've ever

408
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,959
seen seen any of the results of these

409
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,240
models U this is essentially what a

410
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,600
sourc model does it tries to model the

411
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
various populations on orbit um here's a

412
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,480
very simple model which is two

413
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,720
populations intact objects so you can

414
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,920
think about intact objects as intact

415
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,880
satellites that might be derel or might

416
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,279
be active and then debris and there are

417
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,120
sources and syns for these two

418
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,360
populations the sources for intact

419
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,399
objects are the things that might Decay

420
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,480
from a shell above it or might be

421
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,399
launched into that shell and the sinks

422
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,160
are the natural decay of those intact

423
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,759
objects due to atmospheric perturbations

424
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,800
as they uh re-enter in the atmosphere

425
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,480
and burn up in our upper atmosphere and

426
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,720
then obviously the source for debris are

427
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,000
collisions of intact objects and maybe

428
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,120
collisions of orbital debris within with

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,319
themselves um there's also a source from

430
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,360
Decay from above and a snc as the

431
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:50,600
orbital debris decays From Below in

432
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,600
essence you can model this Behavior with

433
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,399
a very s simple um ordinary differential

434
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,920
equation that looks something like this

435
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,120
of course this differential equation is

436
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,839
going to have multiple species on the

437
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,399
right what I'm showing you is if we

438
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,839
model these sources and syns we can look

439
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,000
for points where the sources and sync

440
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,600
balance the amount of things that

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,120
deorbit because of the natural um Decay

442
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,600
effect balances what we're adding up

443
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,319
there from collisions from accidents and

444
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,399
if we look for these natural balancing

445
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,079
points we can find these system

446
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,040
equilibrium and that's what I'm showing

447
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,639
you here on the graph and the notion of

448
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,160
orbital capacity that we uh work on at

449
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:32,079
MIT is where are the system equilibrium

450
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,319
and how do we utilize them to basically

451
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,360
operate um a in the space environment so

452
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,920
that's a sourc model on the other side

453
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,399
there are these Moni Carlo models what

454
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,560
are Moni Carlo models they essentially

455
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,120
try to model each individual object and

456
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,240
by each individual object I mean the

457
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,319
debris the active satellites the rocket

458
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,959
bodies and they model all of their

459
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,279
properties they model the sizes the mass

460
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,399
the areas of these objects and how these

461
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,880
objects interact when they Collide so

462
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,720
you want to think about these models is

463
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,679
having uh an a particular satellite on a

464
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,120
particular orbit and that satellite is

465
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,319
going to collide with a particular piece

466
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,520
of debris the issue with these kind of

467
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,799
models is That Is Random right so that

468
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,959
process of satellites colliding with

469
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:19,400
debris um happen with some probability

470
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,120
so in order for us to get a behavior of

471
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,360
the environment we have to run Monte

472
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,079
Carlo simulations and in essence what

473
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,280
that is is we're repeating the

474
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,760
simulation over and over again with

475
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,960
these random uh fluctuations

476
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,440
of for example this time that rocket

477
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,280
body explodes and generates 10,000 of

478
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,360
pieces of debris and in that simulation

479
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,480
it doesn't and as you can see with the

480
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,400
different curves here of these different

481
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,799
man Carlo simulations you see that the

482
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,480
actual trajectory of the growth and

483
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,720
number of objects looks fairly random

484
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,520
but what we want to know is what's the

485
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,200
distribution of that and what are the

486
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,440
mean values and that's what we uh talk

487
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,760
about as the environment's

488
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,080
evolution and you can think about these

489
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,200
models are sitting on two ends of a

490
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,520
spectrum from more complicated models to

491
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,799
more simple models on the left Spectrum

492
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,559
you have Source Inc models which are

493
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,840
simpler and on the right side of the

494
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,840
spectrum we have more complex models um

495
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,159
such as Monte Carlo the things that you

496
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,039
can do with Source sync models are

497
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,280
things like optimization so for example

498
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,559
I can optimize the environment if I put

499
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,720
one of these models inside of an

500
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,360
optimization code I might need to

501
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,960
evaluate that model 10,000 times for me

502
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,760
to find an optimal solution so it needs

503
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,520
to be fast it needs to be able to run

504
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,480
fast and I need to be able to simulate

505
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,200
thousands and thousands of simulations

506
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,400
on the right I have a very high fidelity

507
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,480
model but these models require

508
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,400
supercomputers so in order for us to

509
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,640
simulate the thousands of objects going

510
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,440
to be on orbit today and also simulate

511
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
the millions of total objects that we

512
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,000
expect in the next 20 to 30 years we

513
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,840
really do need to run these models on

514
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,320
our supercomputer here at MIT um and

515
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,679
push and push the boundary of the number

516
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,400
of objects that we can include in a

517
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,840
simulation like

518
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,440
this okay so if we look at a source sync

519
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,320
model and we do some calculations that

520
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,400
if anyone's interested in the details of

521
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,320
this calculation I didn't want to bore

522
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,360
folks with too many equations uh just

523
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,280
ask me but I'll I'll I'll tell you at at

524
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,799
a very simple level what the details are

525
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,799
so what I did with this what we did with

526
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,640
this work is we basically looked at a

527
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,760
source sync model and we looked for all

528
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,760
of these equilibrium points so we wanted

529
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,400
to find when is the environment at a

530
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,520
homo homeostasis equilibrium where the

531
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,720
objects that we're launching balance out

532
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
these objects that are naturally

533
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,360
decaying and we can keep the environment

534
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,480
at this equilibrium okay so where are

535
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,720
those equilibrium and not only do we do

536
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,400
that but we also optimize for the

537
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,280
equilibria that allow us to operate the

538
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,240
most satellites on orbit so the maximum

539
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,480
number of satellites that we can operate

540
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,760
yet keeping this equilibrium condition

541
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,799
and this is what the curve looks like

542
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,360
and it's is expected we expected this

543
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:54,880
behavior that we can operate uh the

544
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,200
solution are these black points the

545
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,120
orange points are the FCC filings so our

546
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,159
optim our optimized solution look like

547
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,799
the are these black points and then this

548
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,520
is where the future demand is this is

549
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,039
where people have said I want to go to

550
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,120
that orbit I want to go to that orbit

551
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,159
that's the future demand and we get this

552
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,360
behavior that we expected we can fit a

553
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,679
lot more satellites at lower altitudes

554
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,880
and the reason for that is that the

555
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,400
atmosphere is thicker there and it's

556
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,520
much more forg forgiven uh due to

557
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,120
Collision so if you have a collision

558
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,840
there the resident time that that uh

559
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,880
debris is on orbit is fairly short so at

560
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,720
200 km if there's a collision the debris

561
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,080
is only going to be up there for a few

562
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,600
weeks if we get up to let's say 800 km

563
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,919
and there's a collision it could be up

564
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,840
there for 200 years 150 years so it's

565
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,480
less forgiving so we get this very

566
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,640
characteristic behavior that we can fit

567
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,440
a lot more things in lth orbert and we

568
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,320
can't fit that many in high higher

569
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,799
orbits but if we start looking at where

570
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,840
folks want to go we see that there's

571
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,159
these very popular regions like I said

572
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,720
earlier around the 550 let's say to 700

573
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,320
km region this particular point is where

574
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,840
uh Kyper their constellation is is being

575
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,280
proposed to go and there's also a

576
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,360
Chinese constellation that's going to go

577
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,200
at that altitude and I think one of the

578
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,000
SpaceX um shells will be at this

579
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,480
altitude as well and you can see it's

580
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,640
fairly close to this capacity the other

581
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,720
notion that I want to point out is um

582
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,520
these equilibria and this is something

583
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,960
that came out of our work there are a

584
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,679
lot of these potential equilibria but

585
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,919
some of those equilibria are actually

586
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,840
not preferred because they result in

587
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,559
many many collisions so for example in

588
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,440
some of these ium cases and I'll show

589
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:37,520
some results later we have uh up to 10

590
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,919
20% of satellites per year suffering a

591
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,120
collision and being defunct per year but

592
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,679
yet the environment is still at an

593
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,720
equilibrium you might ask why how is

594
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,200
that even possible well it's possible

595
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,559
because as long as those collisions are

596
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,760
happening at lower orbits the atmosphere

597
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,200
cleans it up naturally but if those

598
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,240
collisions are happening at anything at

599
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,320
800 to 1,000 kilm we're in big trouble

600
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,320
so you could have a lot a lot of

601
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,120
collisions down here and you're okay but

602
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,559
we have to ask the question is that even

603
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,200
a future we want to live in where lth

604
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,919
orbit becomes this uh aluminum churning

605
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,520
environment of just constant collisions

606
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,039
and so that brings up a a sort of a

607
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,400
policy level question what risk level do

608
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
we want to operate in um and anyone that

609
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,840
operates in that environment is going to

610
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,760
inherit that risk but here's a really

611
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,880
interesting property about orbital

612
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,720
capacity that we've also discovered if

613
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,039
we look at the optimal solution so let's

614
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,159
say this is we want to launch at 550

615
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,760
let's say this is the current shell 550

616
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:36,000
and we look at the optimal solution so

617
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,200
the capacity of 550 is this blue curve

618
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,720
and then we look at the demand and for

619
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,880
example let's say at 550 starlink wants

620
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,279
to launch a th000 more satellites than

621
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,679
the optimal solution can we accommodate

622
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:51,520
that demand turns out we can and here is

623
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,640
here's an explanation of the physics of

624
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,799
how this works so how do we accommodate

625
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,000
theand that's nonoptimal essentially

626
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:00,440
what we have to do is in the Shell below

627
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,679
it reduce the capacity so our

628
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,240
accommodated population is this orange

629
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,039
so in order to accommodate a greater

630
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,400
number at this current shell and the

631
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,240
shell below it we have to reduce the

632
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,159
capacity in the Shell above it we have

633
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,400
to reduce the capacity and why is that

634
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,679
the case the reason why that's the case

635
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,679
is because if I operate more satellites

636
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,000
than optimal at this shell that means

637
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,840
I'm going to generate more debris at

638
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,039
that shell that debris is going to go

639
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,679
somewhere it's going to Decay and rain

640
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,320
down in the Shell below it if it rains

641
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,600
down to that shell below it that that

642
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,679
means it's going to be more debris in

643
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,520
that shell so that shell has to reduce

644
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,520
its capacity to accommodate this

645
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,919
additional debris and the fact that I

646
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,520
have more satellites in this shell means

647
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,840
that I can operate less satellites above

648
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,080
it because I have a lower capacity for

649
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,240
debris transitioning from this shell to

650
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,360
below it so basically this notion of

651
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,919
capacity is non-local if I if I um want

652
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,679
to accommodate a certain Behavior at a

653
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:53,960
certain altitude it's going to affect

654
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,880
nearby

655
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,000
altitudes and then this is the the

656
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,000
notion that I discussed earlier about uh

657
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,640
um about uh the risk level so for

658
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,159
example here what I'm showing is I'm

659
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,240
showing the orbital capacity as a

660
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,840
function of number of satellites and on

661
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,159
the horizontal axis I'm varying my

662
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,400
acceptable risk and what I what I do

663
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,320
with each one of these points is I

664
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,080
calculate the optimal capacity and

665
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,960
really what this shows that capacity is

666
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,279
not a single number it's in reality it's

667
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,640
a risk capacity manifold it depends on

668
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,000
how much risk we're willing to accept

669
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,159
and it turns out that we have quite a

670
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,120
high number number of equilibrial

671
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,039
solution that we can operate in but some

672
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,640
of these equilibrial solution are at

673
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,320
fairly high risk this is 45% failure

674
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,320
rates due to collisions um talking to

675
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,120
owner operators they want to be more

676
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,600
down to the 1% even lower so this is

677
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,200
what we're comfortable with

678
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,960
nowadays um but if we're not careful we

679
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,760
could lead to a future that we're up

680
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,240
here all right so I want to talk a lot

681
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,399
of that work was on Source sync modeling

682
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,279
I want to talk about the work that we've

683
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,080
done on on the Monte Carl side which are

684
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,679
these high fidelity simulat

685
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,039
so for example these are all the mon

686
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,000
Carlo solutions that the major space

687
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,640
agencies and their support um have

688
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,880
developed so NASA has Legend Isa has

689
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,000
Delta Aerospace has Adept the UK space

690
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,799
agency has damage and so the way that

691
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,840
these models are used is the agencies

692
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,960
analyze different policies and they want

693
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,039
to understand what the debris

694
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,760
environment is going to look like in the

695
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,200
future the issue with these models that

696
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,159
they're all closed Source because of

697
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,440
restrictions such as itar and other

698
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,559
restrictions um some of these agencies

699
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,000
don't want to relas release the code and

700
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,360
the assumptions that have gone into this

701
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,440
model so that motivated us at MIT to

702
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,039
develop our own and so this is why we

703
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,760
developed the mocat as our model and

704
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,559
here's where mocat stands so not only do

705
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,120
we have an open source model but we've

706
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,000
been able to push the envelope in terms

707
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,520
of the state-of-the-art so if we look at

708
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,440
the maximum population that can be

709
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,399
handled with this model and the way that

710
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,679
I'm I'm um plotting this is just looking

711
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:56,559
at the literature so for each point on

712
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,640
this graph there's a reference there's a

713
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,960
paper that's been published so they've

714
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,000
published in the literature of what NASA

715
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
Legend and Delta can do they can get up

716
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,279
to the hundreds of thousands of objects

717
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,159
which is actually pretty good but the

718
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,760
issue is if we model the future Space

719
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,960
Traffic we're not going to be in this

720
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,919
regime we're going to be more in this

721
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,799
regime so mocad is really one of the

722
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,919
first models to be able to push into the

723
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,000
tens of millions of objects which is

724
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,399
what we're actually going to see with

725
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,399
the future traffic so none of these

726
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:25,039
models have been able to run the future

727
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:27,000
traffic simulation because this of this

728
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,760
limitation and our model was the first

729
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,679
to do that so what are these mon Carlo

730
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,840
models look like so for example these

731
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,840
two points that I'm showing here are two

732
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,399
satellites that might be in the mon

733
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,880
Carlo model they Collide they generate a

734
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:40,760
debris cloud and then all each of these

735
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,760
points we calculate what's the

736
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,799
probability that these uh pieces of

737
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,360
debris are going to collide and if they

738
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,600
do Collide we have a breakup model that

739
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
simulates the collision and the

740
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,799
explosion and then we simulate that

741
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,080
forward so that's essentially what's

742
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,919
going on inside of these mon Carlo

743
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,600
models there's a lot of complicated

744
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,720
things that are going on but the output

745
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,880
of the Mante Carlo model are these

746
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,440
simulations

747
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,440
here's a simulation that's going to take

748
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,720
a little bit of time to explain but

749
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,360
really explains what's going on in the

750
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,039
mon Cara model so what I'm showing you

751
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,679
here is a collision that happened at

752
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,919
this

753
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:14,279
altitude now this is a very uh typical

754
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,320
plot that we we use in Space Traffic

755
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,120
management and space debris research

756
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,000
which is called the gabber plot and what

757
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm plotting is I'm plotting two points

758
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,559
I'm plotting the Pary point and the apog

759
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,640
point so for example here's the Pary

760
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,399
point and then the apog point for that

761
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,760
object would be there and then here is

762
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,799
the parag point for some objects down

763
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,640
here and the apy point would be there

764
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,880
parag point or is the closest point that

765
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,520
that satellite gets to the Earth the AP

766
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,679
points the furthest away if the

767
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,000
satellite is in a circular orbit that

768
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,640
means that the radius of the satellite

769
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,799
is constant per and AP equal so these

770
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,120
are two circular orbits per and AP equal

771
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,480
that collided notice that they generate

772
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,120
debris that are not circular the parag

773
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,840
and apog points are not equal so this

774
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,240
Collision is generating Ecentric objects

775
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,440
it's kicking up objects into higher

776
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,880
altitude which is a problem it's also

777
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,640
kicking objects into lower altitudes

778
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,960
which is okay but the problem is that

779
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,360
these objects are also going into higher

780
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,640
altitudes and if you look at the size

781
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,679
distribution uh 50 cm down to 1 cm these

782
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,039
um smaller objects have high area to

783
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,799
mass ratios so these smaller objects are

784
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,679
actually deorbiting quite quickly but

785
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,039
some of these larger objects can stay up

786
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,200
there uh fairly long in the environment

787
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,240
and that's because their area to mass

788
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,080
ratios are low so you can see that this

789
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,559
is the deorbiting uh sort of behavior

790
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,679
you can see the objects start to deorbit

791
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,760
but there's a lot of objects that are

792
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,080
deorbiting very slowly this is a 30-year

793
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,919
simulation of a collision at 1200 km and

794
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,799
then so if we do the no future launch

795
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,120
case where we don't have any launches

796
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,760
this is what the future environment

797
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,200
looks like so if there's no launches

798
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,720
basically um you see star link down here

799
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,799
a lot of satellites and then after some

800
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,279
while the starlink the orbits but we

801
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,880
don't see this growth of debris down

802
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,039
here really where the debris starts

803
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,720
growing are altitudes above 700 km

804
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,960
because we're outside of the atmosphere

805
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,000
so if you talk about where the

806
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,640
problematic regions are are these higher

807
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,919
altitudes and you can see that even if

808
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,360
we stop launching the amount of debris

809
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,519
at about 800 km is going to grow and

810
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,120
this simulation all other models that I

811
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,200
mentioned earlier can do simulations

812
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,720
like this but the simulations that they

813
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,279
can't do are simulations like this that

814
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,799
we were able to do uh with our approach

815
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:26,640
so this is the Mega constellation future

816
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,600
what what we're modeling here is the FCC

817
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,679
filings and all of the satellites that

818
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,320
are being proposed to be launched such

819
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:37,240
as starlink gen one Gen 2 uh spin launch

820
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,320
has a constellation one web Boeing and

821
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,640
they're going at these different

822
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,880
altitudes and they're also staging their

823
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,799
launches they're not just going to all

824
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,799
launch at once they're going to launch

825
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,919
over time so we can model that uh

826
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:49,360
launching over time and then what we see

827
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,640
in our simulations if we model this

828
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,679
future is that the amount of objects in

829
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,919
our catalog gets into the tens of

830
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,840
millions 20 million objects and this is

831
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,120
one reason why some of the other state

832
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,320
of the the art Solutions can't handle

833
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,480
it's because they really can't get into

834
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,919
the millions of objects but one thing

835
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,399
that we've been concerned about is star

836
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,640
link they're gen one versus gen two Gen

837
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,600
2 has about 30,000 satellites gen one is

838
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,279
about 7,000 so folks have been very

839
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,360
concerned about that we're not seeing

840
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:16,679
much of a difference in the growth in

841
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,799
the the Bri population between gen one

842
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,320
and gen two and so why is that the case

843
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,480
the reason that's the case is that gen

844
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,480
two is actually uh putting a lot of

845
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,159
satellites at very low altitudes and

846
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,200
there's a reason for this so you know

847
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,720
Gen 2 wants to connect to your smart

848
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,039
phone uh they want to provide uh direct

849
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,799
cell phone connection I think right now

850
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,200
there's some of that in um some of your

851
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,360
smartphones that if you have an

852
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,120
emergency you can connect to a satellite

853
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,840
but in the future the hope is that

854
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,480
satellites could augment our ground

855
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,760
Network where you don't have coverage

856
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,440
and so they want to launch a lot of

857
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,919
satellites at lower altitudes and these

858
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,679
satellites will deorbit actually uh the

859
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,840
debris generated due to these satellites

860
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,960
will deorbit fairly quickly at these

861
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,279
higher altitudes um there's still some

862
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,039
debris that's there you can see this

863
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,960
banding pattern what this banding

864
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,240
pattern is is the space weather 11year

865
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,080
cycle so as we have high space weather

866
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,919
activity more space debris de orbits

867
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,039
when we have low space weather activity

868
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,880
the space debris stays up there longer

869
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,799
so we see this banding pattern and this

870
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,000
is happening at the starlink orbits it's

871
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,720
not fairly dramatic but the dramatic

872
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,519
growth when you see this exponential

873
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,600
growth in in debris is actually

874
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,919
happening at these higher altitudes

875
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,440
these higher altitudes are the problem

876
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,559
areas the numbers might not be as large

877
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,919
but the resident time of debris can be

878
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,120
hundreds of years if not uh greater so

879
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,440
I'm just going back to the simulation

880
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,240
this is the exact same data that I

881
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,399
showed at the beginning that's why the

882
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,519
simulation looks so red but if you zoom

883
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:43,360
in further and you look at the altitude

884
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,639
banding you could see that a lot of the

885
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,760
debris is actually being generated at

886
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:49,960
these higher altitudes so it's a much

887
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,600
more nuanced picture than um you know

888
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,679
the simple simulation shows we really do

889
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,200
need to focus at where which altitudes

890
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,639
are the problematic areas I do want to

891
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,559
leave off um with one final topic which

892
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,600
is uh the iceberg in the room which is

893
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,279
the lethal non-trackable population

894
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,760
these are objects that are up there that

895
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,840
are space cataloging um can't track but

896
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,279
they can potentially destroy or kill a

897
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,480
satellite these are objects from um

898
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:19,039
diameters of 5 cm so think about like a

899
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,360
um a softball to things that are 1 cm so

900
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,279
if that hits a satellite it will

901
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,200
absolutely destroy the satellite but

902
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,919
they are close to untrackable so if we

903
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,279
look at that population what's the

904
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,440
effect of the lethal NRA aable

905
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,279
population so there's two types of

906
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,679
collisions that I'm showing you here one

907
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,399
is non-catastrophic and one is

908
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,960
catastrophic a non-catastrophic

909
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,519
collision it's like you can imagine a

910
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,480
bullet flying through a satellite I shot

911
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,440
a bullet at the satellite it passes

912
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,279
right through it kills a satellite it

913
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,000
destroys their onboard computer but

914
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,679
generates very minimal fragments because

915
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,039
it just passes right through a

916
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,039
catastrophic Collision is a collision

917
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,559
that has enough energy that it disiner

918
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,240
the satellites when they when that

919
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,760
Collision happens the satellite breaks

920
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,639
up into thousands of pieces it turns out

921
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,519
that the lethal non trable population as

922
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:04,639
we include more and more of them we go

923
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,039
in smaller and smaller sizes will

924
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,760
generate more and more non-catastrophic

925
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,080
collisions but not a lot of catastrophic

926
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,519
collisions until till we get to this

927
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,360
point and we see an e in the curve and

928
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,399
essentially what's happening there is

929
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,240
this lethal nont trable population is

930
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:22,200
destroying satellites um but not gener

931
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,120
generating a ton of debris but that

932
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,320
deric satellite that's been uh basically

933
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,760
uh made non-operable

934
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,600
is now on orbit and that satellite can

935
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,200
potentially collide with other derik

936
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,320
satellites or active satellites and

937
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,600
generate these catastrophic collisions

938
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,120
so that's the issue with lethal

939
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,120
non-trackable they really change our

940
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,279
postm mission disposal rate and the risk

941
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,799
level that we have on orbit um so I want

942
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,880
to make sure we have enough time for

943
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,799
questions so um just a quick note on

944
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,080
this what we did here is we looked at

945
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:53,720
smaller and smaller lethal non-trackable

946
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,799
and the effect that we see is that space

947
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,559
weather becomes a more dramatic effect

948
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,120
on the lethal non-trackable population

949
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,000
and I did want to just touch on what

950
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,960
we're doing in terms of policy one of

951
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,880
the pieces of work that we're doing is

952
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,519
on the side of adaptive adaptive

953
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,560
governance so we've been working with

954
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,639
NASA on figuring out how these tools can

955
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,040
be used with policy and one of the

956
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,919
approaches that we're working on is this

957
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,919
idea of adaptive governance where um

958
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,359
instead of having fixed capacity levels

959
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,839
or fixed regulatory uh quotas what we

960
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,280
want to do is be more adaptive to events

961
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,119
and use our models to understand where

962
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,119
can we place new misss and in in in

963
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,040
essence do that as as a response to the

964
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,560
environment as opposed to having fixed

965
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,079
quotas and fixed

966
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,800
rules and so um actually I want to end

967
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:43,760
by summarizing so I've shown a lot of

968
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,000
work and one of the the threads in our

969
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,200
work is we really want to move from this

970
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,320
qualitative discussion to a quantitative

971
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,960
discussion currently there's no shared

972
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,679
definition of orbital capacity in the

973
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,160
limits and that's going to limit

974
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,520
agreement amongst Nations among amongst

975
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,119
operators permission guidelines which is

976
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,240
kind of what we're using now is

977
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,400
insufficient to ensure Leo

978
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,320
sustainability and the more important

979
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,960
point that we've come across is there

980
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,320
are various modeling approaches that

981
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,800
exist but they're mostly closed source

982
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,280
which makes them difficult to replicate

983
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,000
and can model the debate so in terms of

984
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,240
space sustainability we really think we

985
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,440
got to go to an open- Source uh

986
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,680
transparent uh Paradigm and then finally

987
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,920
these concerns can be weaponized both

988
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,880
from a a a nation state perspective and

989
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,880
also a commercial perspective to uh

990
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,079
produce regulatory Market exclusion we

991
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,720
don't want that so as much as we can we

992
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,200
want to go to a physics based

993
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,280
calculation where these discussions are

994
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,240
not weaponized so with that I think we

995
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,240
have maybe a minute or two for some

996
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:51,599
[Applause]

997
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,599
questions question

998
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,560
there was an issue earlier I think with

999
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,760
the

1000
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:16,520
mic better hi Martin beum from GSA um I

1001
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,400
wonder is in my head I'm thinking that

1002
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,400
there's a failure mode that's more

1003
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,520
Cascade more

1004
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,400
catastrophic than I got the sense from

1005
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,480
from what you presented like one you

1006
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,599
know one failure hits three others hits

1007
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,720
20

1008
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,240
others is there a sense of that sort of

1009
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,280
failing there is and they happen at

1010
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,119
higher altitudes so that's definitely

1011
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,760
there this Kessler effect and I can show

1012
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:46,040
you one graph um without getting super

1013
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,480
technical um this graph here so if you

1014
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,960
look at this graph here and you look at

1015
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,200
this these equilibrium point right

1016
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,200
there's an unstable one and a stable one

1017
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,599
at this point what happens is the two

1018
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,680
equilibrium points converge and they

1019
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,640
become complex there's no equilibrium

1020
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,800
any point above this point is Kesler

1021
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,880
right but the thing is at low altitudes

1022
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
there's plenty of equilibria so the

1023
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,640
number we have to get to at low

1024
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,800
altitudes can be in the

1025
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,119
millions but it depends on the altitude

1026
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,760
if you get high enough you get to a

1027
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,680
th000 kilometers that's what we're

1028
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,160
seeing that some of those altitudes are

1029
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,800
probably above that Tipping Point

1030
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,160
because if we stop launching today the

1031
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,400
debris is still going to grow so yeah

1032
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,400
it's

1033
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:29,520
there another

1034
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,950
location okay thank you very much thank

1035
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,230
you

1036
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,230
[Applause]
