1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,319
Welcome

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,360
back. So, it's my absolute pleasure to

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,960
introduce Dr. Ricardo Mororrow Pinto.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,280
Um, he's an assistant professor of

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,599
neurology at Harvard Medical School. In

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,480
addition to that, he's a Brody who's a

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,720
member of the MPG program. He also runs

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,840
a lab um at the center for genomic

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,080
medicine at MGB um where he is focused

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
on neurogenerative diseases including

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,160
Friedri's itexia and Huntington

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
Huntington's disease and he'll tell you

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,320
more about um his research today. Thanks

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
Ricardo

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,960
m perfect thank you so much for the

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,640
invitation to present our work here. Um

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,960
so um just quick disclosure so as Julian

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,360
mentioned we're very much interested in

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
repeat expansion diseases and uh I'll

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
touch a little bit on on um Huntington's

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,960
disease which is a autotosomal um

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,320
dominant disorder caused by u a cagg

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,080
expansion in the htt1 in the htt gene in

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,320
exxon one and once you inherit uh an

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280
expansion beyond about 40 cag repeats

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,520
you'll develop uh hingtons at some point

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,000
in your life and uh the disease is

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
primarily characterized by uh neuronal

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,799
loss uh throughout the brain but

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,520
primarily in the

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:24,640
striatum as you can appreciate here the

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,159
atrophy in in the brain and um

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
interestingly that there's a strong

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
relationship between the length of the

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
repeat and the severity of the disease.

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,640
So the longer the repeat, the earlier

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,400
you'll develop symptoms and uh you'll

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,680
also have a faster and more severe

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,680
progression. And this the disease can

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,320
manifest in a variety of different ways

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,079
uh primarily motor symptoms but also

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,079
cognitive and u and

43
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,640
behavioral. And an interesting aspect

44
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,119
about these repeats is that they're

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
unstable. So common phenomenon in

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,560
Huntington's disease is called

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
anticipation. So meaning from generation

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,000
to generation patients tend to develop

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,560
the disease earlier than their parents.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,280
And this is primarily because the repeat

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,200
changes from generation to generation.

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,760
And as you can see here from maternal

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,080
transmission is sort of stable. So the

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,239
child will have more or less the same

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,959
repeat as the mother had. But if the

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,120
transmission is from the father, there's

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
a higher chance that it will expand and

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
it will become much longer and therefore

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,239
that the child will end up developing

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,239
the disease

61
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,840
earlier. But something that hasn't been

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,480
so well appreciated is also the fact

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,280
that the repeat is also unstable in the

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,680
brain. It it's not just in the germline

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,800
but also sematically in in the brain.

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,680
And you're seeing here uh a brain from

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,400
an individual that died not from HD.

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,560
This is a brain uh about 13 years before

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
the predicted onset. So there's no real

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
signs of um neuro degeneration in this

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,760
brain. But you already see some neurons

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,840
or some cells from what you can

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,040
appreciate here that have expanded

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
drastically beyond the two inherited al.

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
So this would be the wild type. These

76
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,080
would be the mutant alil and you can see

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,360
expansions all the way up to a

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,640
thousand. Uh and this starts in the

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,080
strium. This is a different brain late

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,400
stage uh heavily degenerated. Um and it

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,440
it starts uh you start seeing it

82
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
throughout the brain. This uh

83
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,360
instability is present in different

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,239
parts of the brain. Um and stratum in

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
this particular brain strikingly low.

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,760
But the hypothesis that at this point

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,760
you hardly have any neurons left. most

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,560
of the stridum is gone. Um so you're

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,840
you're not really seeing it. And I'll

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,159
present a couple of data. Some of you

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,640
you're probably aware of some of Carol's

92
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,040
work, but um there's been some focus on

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,159
trying to understand exactly where this

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,400
is occurring at the cell type specific

95
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,959
matter. Uh and two studies that came out

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
in the last couple of years, one by Nat

97
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,840
Hines group in Rockefeller, uh where

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,720
they did fan sorting. So they enrich for

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,239
different uh neuron different cell types

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,120
from the brain and size the CG repeating

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,360
each of these enriched populations and u

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,120
you can see that in medium spiny neurons

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,639
which are the the the neurons that are

104
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,320
primarily affected in Huntington's

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,919
disease accumulate these

106
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,960
repeats and and Steve validated that

107
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,919
with with a independent approach with

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,240
single cell level uh sizing the the the

109
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,680
neurons um um characterizing the the the

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,040
different cell types based on

111
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,600
transcriptional um information and but

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,360
realizing that these large expansions

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,360
are only present in medium spiny

114
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,040
neurons. But interesting what this

115
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,880
allowed um uh this single cell

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,720
resolution allowed to ask a different

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,479
question. How um different are these

118
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,040
neurons from each other? these medium

119
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,639
spiny neurons. And turns out they're

120
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,000
they're not that sick. They're not that

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,720
different. Uh neurons that have these uh

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,160
CAG repeats that are 40 that we would

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,680
consider pathogenic. They're

124
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,759
indistinguishable as they increase in

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,320
size and it's only once they cross a

126
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,720
certain threshold of about 150 cages

127
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,240
that become dysfunctional and then they

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
die.

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
So this is very very important because

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
changes completely the way we understand

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,360
the disease and how we approach it from

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,520
a therapeutic point of

133
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,919
view and and it makes a lot of sense

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,880
also to intersect it with genomewide

135
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,440
association data. So data from patients

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,600
um um all the way from the the last 10

137
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,400
years going up from 4,000s all the way

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,160
to 16,000 patients and and this is not

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,919
the traditional GI was this is not a

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,720
case control. These are all patients and

141
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,000
we're just looking for the effect of uh

142
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,600
um the effect on age of onset. What this

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,039
so these are would be modifier um genes

144
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
and we're starting to see a pattern.

145
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,520
Most of these are DNA repair genes. Um

146
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,440
you do find Huntington gene and I'll get

147
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,240
into that later. This is an interruption

148
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,639
in the uh in the gene. But most of the

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,759
other uh genes that are coming up are

150
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,280
DNA repair

151
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,720
genes. And this was very interesting

152
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,240
when we started looking at this because

153
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,160
this was actually something that we had

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,080
already discovered in the mouse. So in

155
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,080
genetic crosses with mice, we knew that

156
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,039
some of these genes were essential for

157
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,240
this uh sematic expansion. So when we

158
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,120
cross an HD mouse with an MLH1 knockout

159
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,479
or with an MLH3 knockout mouse, we were

160
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,240
completely abolishing. So this is um

161
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,000
expansion just a different way of

162
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,919
quantifying the CAG expansions. uh this

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
would be the inherited al this would be

164
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,840
expansion. When you knock out these

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,080
genes, you completely abolish the the

166
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,600
expansion. So you stabilize the

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,000
repeat. And this led us to build a model

168
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,360
at the time that was fairly incomplete

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,960
and uh but we with the poor

170
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,680
understanding we had of that model and

171
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,759
the the increasing number of genes that

172
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,080
were coming out of the GI was we wanted

173
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,080
to try to establish a functional role.

174
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,759
most of them we didn't really know what

175
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,919
function they had in Huntington's

176
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,720
disease. So we we designed um a crisper

177
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:25,199
screen an invivo crisper screen um where

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,199
we cross our HDMI with a

179
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,120
nozzogously and then we just have to

180
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:34,080
deliver the guides of interest in an

181
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,160
AV HD animal so that we allow expansions

182
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,160
to either uh occur

183
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,400
or stabilize them if we turn off a gene

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400
that is um a driver of instability.

185
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,560
and and this is just a a validation

186
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,120
experiment. So we're seeing here that

187
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,360
these just different way of quantifying

188
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,080
this. We can convert this into a into an

189
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
index the rate of instability. So we

190
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,879
know that it is age dependent. It keeps

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
getting larger and larger uh in the

192
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:10,879
striatum. Um and um actually this is

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,400
data in liver at this point. uh we

194
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,080
leveraged the fact that AV8 uh is very

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
strong at transducing the liver and the

196
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,360
the instability is also occurring in the

197
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,879
liver. Um and we noticed that if we

198
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,720
knocked out the genes that were um

199
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
essential for driving expansions, we

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,759
completely stabilized the repeat all the

201
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
way to the same level that when we

202
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,360
started the experiment. Conversely, fan

203
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,880
one, which is a strong modifier that

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,080
came out of the the patient uh GI was we

205
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,080
accelerate the rate of

206
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,800
expansion. So here showing the the

207
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,160
result of the screen. This is data

208
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,640
coming from about 600 mice, total of 60

209
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,519
genes. Um and we we probed a variety of

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,320
different genes coming from the GI was

211
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,240
data set. Uh and a variety of different

212
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,399
DNA repair pathways and some of them

213
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,320
coming from the literature. Uh but so we

214
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,440
proed a these different 60 genes and

215
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,519
ranked them based on effect on sematic

216
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,760
expansions. And interestingly what we're

217
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,480
still find is exactly the same. It's the

218
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:22,000
mismatch repair uh pathway that is uh

219
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,399
either stabilizing or accelerating the

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,399
rate of

221
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,240
expansion. And

222
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,360
here at this point we were only doing it

223
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,279
in in the liver. It's it's a

224
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,959
neurological disease. We we um

225
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,279
collaborated with with Ben Everman. We

226
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:46,000
packaged this in PHP to to uh target the

227
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,920
the stryatum and we we could validate

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
these genes and in um in the

229
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,440
brain alternative ways of validating. We

230
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,160
actually for some of these they were

231
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,720
novel targets like PMS1. We generated

232
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,360
the the the mice and we we crossed them

233
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,440
um with our HD mice and we observed that

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,839
PMS1 is an essential gene. It it's um

235
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,399
it's not as strong of an effect as some

236
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,120
of the genes but it's significantly

237
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,800
reduced instability in u in the in the

238
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,959
brain.

239
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,240
Um and we we validated we collaborated

240
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,519
with Gazella lab to develop a cell model

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,680
of of expansions. So in culture the

242
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,360
repeat would expand in a in a short

243
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,959
period of time and when we knock out uh

244
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,760
these modifier genes we can either

245
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,240
stabilize it over time or accelerate it

246
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,959
and we can use it to validate our denovo

247
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,959
sort of hits.

248
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,920
still from the point of view of

249
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,399
mechanism exactly how this occurs um

250
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,279
we're very interested in in a gene MLH3

251
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,959
um because of of

252
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:03,200
um of its role as a as an

253
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,519
endonucleaz so we wanted to know because

254
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
there was still a question about does it

255
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
only require these proteins to be

256
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,079
recruited to the these secondary

257
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,240
structures or do you need catalytic

258
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,680
activity so uh we've used a mouse model

259
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,600
that had point mutation in the

260
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,440
endonucleus domain that's still

261
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,760
expressed it still forms a dimer but um

262
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
um question does it still promote

263
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,880
expansions and the answer is no if you

264
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,079
if you have no endonucleaz activity you

265
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,000
completely stabilize the repeat um so

266
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,760
interesting this also provides and it's

267
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,399
become clearer later but it provides us

268
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,160
a different way of how to target these

269
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,720
genes and and this is we just recently

270
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,360
published this but it's sort of uh uh

271
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,920
our current understanding of how this

272
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,000
occurs. So we in red here we have the

273
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,160
CAG uh repeats um during transcription

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,079
or during replication in neurons it

275
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,079
would be during transcription you'll

276
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,480
unwind um the DNA and you'll have um

277
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,440
propensity to form these slipped strand

278
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,240
structures these hairpin structures that

279
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,360
get primarily recognized by MSH2 MSH3 or

280
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,920
mutas beta and then recruit other

281
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,839
components of the mute the the different

282
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:26,880
mutel um components uh of mismatch

283
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,959
repair. We believe that MLH3 is required

284
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,600
to cut the opposite strand. Um and then

285
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,040
uh you'll have a polymerase delta which

286
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,440
is also a gene that I didn't have time

287
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,600
to go into that came out of our screen

288
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:46,320
to uh synthesize a new copy of the DNA.

289
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,360
And by doing so in both strands you add

290
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
uh additional

291
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,440
repeats and um as I mentioned at the

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,480
beginning we're very much interested in

293
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,240
repeat expansions uh and it's not we

294
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,880
primarily work on Huntington's disease

295
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,040
and ftheraxi but this is a group of as

296
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,160
many as 60 u uh different rare diseases.

297
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,959
Um so here that you've got the the cagg

298
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,360
CTG uh repeats that tend to form

299
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,720
hairpins the Huntington's disease spinal

300
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,560
cerebellar at taxia monic distrophe and

301
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,600
um fuks coral distrophe um but then you

302
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,120
have others as well that are um a little

303
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,519
bit longer so something I didn't mention

304
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,240
they can occur the variety of different

305
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:36,000
locations both coding or non-coding u

306
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,000
just in regulatory regions um they can

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,079
have a variety different lengths of CAG

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,720
repeats in Huntington's disease around

309
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,560
40 to 60 CAG repeats at majority of

310
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,440
patients but other diseases are in the

311
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,279
thousands that that have a repeat and

312
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,880
another interesting aspect is that

313
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,880
depending on their sequence they can

314
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,880
form a variety of different secondary

315
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,600
structures we believe that that's what's

316
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,720
u makes them likely to be uh recognized

317
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:05,279
by the DNA repair machinery and

318
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,199
expand but because they they all have

319
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,279
sematic instability We also want to

320
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,279
leverage can we identify a common

321
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,680
genetic uh therapeutic target that would

322
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,360
pro possibly be uh have therapeutic

323
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
value not only to Huntington's disease

324
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,399
but a variety of other repeat expansion

325
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,160
disease.

326
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,199
So we performed the same similar

327
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,760
experiments, similar screens um and

328
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,079
summarizing here just those results for

329
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,800
Huntington's disease from Friders taxi

330
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,959
which is a GA repeat and fragile legs.

331
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,600
We're doing this now in in spinal cerell

332
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,760
or ataxia one as well and we're trying

333
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,760
to combine this data to try to

334
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,920
understand in what directions this this

335
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,399
modify the the

336
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:52,079
instability and we've identified a few

337
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,720
uh want to caution that you know it's

338
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,760
tricky thing to target DNA repair uh

339
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,880
it's there for a reason uh we think in

340
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,160
this case it's actually misreping um but

341
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,720
to we need to be careful because some of

342
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,959
these are actually quite strongly

343
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,000
associated with with cancer particularly

344
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,440
colon cancer. Um but there are three

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,480
that are very minimal uh effect or many

346
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,920
very little uh documented um

347
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,720
implications for cancer. They're

348
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,000
primarily involved in spermatogenesis in

349
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,680
replication um in uh in biotic

350
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,440
recombination. Um but so we've

351
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,680
identified these three particular genes

352
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,920
that we're kind of excited and the field

353
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,480
is also uh excited

354
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,279
about. Um few examples on how we can

355
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,839
target these. I'll give you a quick one

356
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,760
on how to use a small molecule a splice

357
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,480
modulator something that was actually uh

358
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,199
under um testing for Huntington's

359
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,720
disease but with Huntington's disease as

360
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,880
being the target. So just as a

361
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,040
Huntington lowering strategy, one of its

362
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,560
offt targets is actually PMS1, one of

363
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,000
the the genes that we've shown as a

364
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,800
modifier. Um, and we can see that with

365
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,800
with this drug, we can reduce the level

366
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,279
of PMS1 and we can also reduce the

367
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,279
effect on

368
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,360
instability here. just sort of

369
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,600
validating the the therapeutic effect uh

370
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,320
of uh so transcriptional disregulation

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:30,000
and and also accumulation of mutant

372
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:32,320
protein. Um the when you knock out PMS1

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,560
you reduce the accumulation of the of

374
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,959
the mutant protein in the nucleus the

375
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,759
strumm and also you you sort of rescue

376
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,759
some of these transcriptional changes.

377
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,000
So uh sort of validating this

378
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,000
therapeutic um um

379
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,440
target. Um going back to MLH3 um we

380
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,160
we're particularly excited about this

381
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,720
because

382
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,480
uh knowing the the

383
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,800
the dependency on the endonucleus

384
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,400
activity and the fact that this gene is

385
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,079
expressed as two variants, one

386
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
containing the endonucleus and one

387
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,360
without through alternative splicing. um

388
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,079
collaborated with with Ed Grabzik to use

389
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,319
ASOS to sort of favor the splicing of

390
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,839
this gene towards the endonucleus

391
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,319
lacking

392
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,880
um

393
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:26,360
version. And interestingly, this is even

394
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,760
expressed uh um in in

395
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,880
some regions you have the endonucleus

396
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,240
lacking um version expressed at higher

397
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,240
levels than the one containing the

398
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
endonucleus.

399
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,360
and and and briefly u try to go through

400
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,240
this quickly because we've tested these

401
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,440
with ASOS and we could suppress sematic

402
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,880
expansions with ASOS but they we

403
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,240
couldn't use them so well preclinally um

404
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,960
we couldn't get them to target the the

405
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,440
brain as effectively uh even though

406
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,440
we're able to reduce sematic expansions

407
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,280
in the kidney um it

408
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:14,320
um it it wasn't as easy to to do with

409
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,919
NASO and uh based on our collaborations

410
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,960
with with David Lou and with Ben

411
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,880
Kleinstever we sort of pivoted um with

412
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,200
this strategy still keeping the same

413
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,520
target and the same mechanism but with a

414
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,160
with a different

415
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,640
approach and we hypothesized that given

416
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,679
how conserved splice acceptors are

417
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,640
across species we hypothesize that we

418
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,720
simply disrupt did this ag sequence we

419
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,200
would be able to um um alter the the

420
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,799
splicing of that region. So we as I

421
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,520
mentioned collaborated with with David

422
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,280
who's invented base editors and and

423
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
don't need much of an introduction here

424
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,559
and with Ben Kleinstever who has

425
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,720
engineered these uh enzymes so that they

426
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,480
can recognize a variety of different PAM

427
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
domain. So we can essentially target

428
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,919
different regions in the genome and not

429
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,200
necessarily limited to an an NG

430
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,280
PAM. So how did we do this? We

431
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,679
essentially tile the entire region with

432
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,840
a variety of different guides uh with a

433
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,799
variety of different ABS and a variety

434
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,120
of different

435
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,880
CBEs and uh fortunately we we identified

436
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,320
a couple that actually were seem to be

437
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,120
quite effective um in hex cells and this

438
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,280
is what we've been pursuing further with

439
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,000
in

440
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,360
u further validation. Importantly, we've

441
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,440
showed that a single point mutation um

442
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,760
is a is uh sufficient to completely

443
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,760
change the splicing. So, we no longer

444
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,720
have any uh expression of the transcript

445
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,160
that has the

446
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,600
endonucleaz. And in fact when we test is

447
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,600
in a in a in a cell line that has

448
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,360
instability. So you can see here across

449
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,760
a month of culture the repeat expands

450
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,039
when we have this single point mutation

451
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,039
we completely stabilize

452
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,400
it. Um next we've already started our

453
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,320
preclinical work. We have to generate

454
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,120
the mouse model. So rather than testing

455
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,080
this and and using guides towards the

456
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,080
mouse sequencing, we've um we've

457
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,559
engineered a mouse that contains the

458
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,919
human uh sequence flanking it.

459
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,240
Interestingly, and this is something

460
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:33,360
that curious biology just changing these

461
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:38,159
30 base pairs, we we all of a sudden the

462
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,039
mouse is splicing like a human um cell

463
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,640
would. So all of a sudden we now mice

464
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,919
normally just express variant one and

465
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,240
all of a sudden with this humanized

466
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,240
sequence there there's alternative

467
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,240
splicing performed very quickly

468
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,679
preclinical work with with some um I

469
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,120
would say not optimal uh AEV preps. Um

470
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,159
this is something that we still need to

471
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,280
to repeat but um we identified a couple

472
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,080
of animals where we had decent editing

473
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,720
in the stridum.

474
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,120
um we show that in this rumm we're

475
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,640
altering the splicing and more

476
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,159
importantly we're reducing the

477
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,720
instability by 40% even with these uh

478
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:26,400
sort of poor AV preps. So we're quite

479
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,400
excited about this um um and moving it

480
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,679
forward. Again important considerations

481
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,679
here is uh really terms of safety and in

482
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,919
terms of delivery. These are things that

483
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,080
still need a lot of work.

484
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,000
Um I'll uh won't touch too much here but

485
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,480
here just going another example of our

486
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,880
collaborations here at the broad uh and

487
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,679
giving you

488
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,559
um a different

489
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,720
strategy also targeting expansions we

490
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,440
know that individuals with interruptions

491
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,960
and uh in the middle of the cag repeat

492
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,120
develop the disease later. So um work

493
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,679
done by Janera here at the David's lab

494
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,679
hypothesized that if we were to use base

495
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,640
editors to introduce these silent um uh

496
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,760
CA interruptions within the CAG repeat

497
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,480
we would slow down

498
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:26,480
instability and in fact we do and um so

499
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,280
when we have about um 30 40% editing in

500
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,720
in the strumm we can reduce the rate of

501
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:37,600
expansions and also promote the rate of

502
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:40,880
contractions. Um, so just a a little bit

503
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,960
of a a cartoonish overview. Uh, we think

504
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,440
that throughout the life of an

505
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,480
individual, the CAG repeats keep

506
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,559
expanding in a cell type specific manner

507
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,600
until they hit a third certain threshold

508
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,520
where it starts becoming toxic and

509
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,679
causing neurodeeneration. you start

510
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,679
losing these neurons and upon a certain

511
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:06,080
time that will manifest as symptoms. Um

512
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:08,000
we from the genomewide association study

513
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,159
we hypothesize that there are certain

514
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
genetic variants that will change the

515
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,200
rate of that process how fast the repeat

516
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,960
expands or how slow it expands and it

517
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,600
will manifest as different ages of

518
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,120
onset. And so we hypothesize that if we

519
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,679
use a therapeutic to slow down or stop

520
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,600
sematic expansions, you will either slow

521
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,679
the progression or if you go before

522
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,840
onset and you're effective enough in

523
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,280
stabilizing the repeats that you can

524
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,400
effectively cure these

525
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,799
diseases. And so with that, I want to

526
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,919
thank um everyone in the lab, our

527
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:49,320
collaborators and and the funding and

528
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,320
letters to cures for support. Thank you.

529
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,520
As we mentioned, we'll do uh Q&A um

530
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,600
jointly. So, our next speaker is Dr. Jen

531
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Pan. Jen is the director of

532
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,840
translational neurobiology here at the

533
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,240
Broad Institute in the Stanley Center um

534
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,080
where her lab focuses on um high

535
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,559
throughput evaluation of ion channel

536
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,919
physiology and next generation

537
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,760
therapeutics. Um importantly, she's also

538
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,200
an adviser to the Kacno 1A Foundation

539
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,440
whose leadership is in the audience

540
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,320
today. Um, welcome Jen.

541
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,799
Hello. Thank you so much Jillian um for

542
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,120
that introduction and I wanted to thank

543
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,600
Anna and Julian for organizing such a

544
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,480
fantastic symposium. It has been

545
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,080
inspiring to hear the messages, the

546
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,799
approach, uh the research and stories.

547
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,159
So uh today I'm going to talk to you

548
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:47,120
about one of my favorite genes 1A which

549
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,360
encodes a an ion channel. um a as an

550
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,159
example of how we think about rare

551
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,679
genetic um coding changes with

552
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,679
intermediate effect size uh is going to

553
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,440
contribute to the disease burden. How we

554
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:04,320
think about the um uh treatment

555
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,840
strategy. Okay, there we go. So uh I

556
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,120
wanted to start with a few words about

557
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:14,400
channelopathy. The monogenic medelion uh

558
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
uh mutations that causing diseases in

559
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
ion channels has been studied since the

560
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,120
beginning of the molecular genetics.

561
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,360
These are recurring mutations produce a

562
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,039
common shared disease phenotype and then

563
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,679
there are many reports of such. there

564
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,480
are very few mutations but once it

565
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,600
happens it produce very repeatable uh

566
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,880
very common uh disease phenotype and

567
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,279
then in the past two decades a China op

568
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,080
in complex polygenic disorders has been

569
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,279
discussed and has been discovered by the

570
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,240
G-W was um on the right here is a figure

571
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,360
that was published 15 years ago by Steve

572
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,720
Mccara and Peter Fishell and many others

573
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,559
they uh demonstrated that at that time

574
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,760
there might be missing heritability from

575
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,760
G-Wall studies. Uh are these rare and

576
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,919
low frequency coding variations in in um

577
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,679
with intermediate effect size in this

578
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:13,360
spectrum of the disease and um this is

579
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,840
what I'm going to focus on today. Uh so

580
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:19,760
why do we care about these rare and

581
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,159
intermediate um uh uh frequency

582
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,559
intermediate effect size low and rare

583
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:30,240
frequency uh rare coding uh varants and

584
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,159
so so fast forward 15 years to where we

585
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,440
are now our ability to detect them has

586
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:42,000
increased exponentially. So here is a

587
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,480
figure of how many um sea variants has

588
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,919
been identified in the past 20 years and

589
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,000
you can see with the DNA sequencing exom

590
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,240
sequencing we have starting to see

591
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,279
hundreds of the variants but many of

592
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,360
them with unknown uh function. So

593
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:01,240
annotating a large number of coding

594
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:05,520
variants are necessary um

595
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,000
to explore in a cohort in a a set

596
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,039
disease cohort sets has been become

597
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,520
accessible and we have increasingly able

598
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,400
to identify these low frequency coding

599
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,640
alals and channel opt is a great place

600
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,440
to start addressing the connection

601
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,159
between genetics and functional

602
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:27,440
consequences because ion channels they

603
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,440
have these assays to precisely

604
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,240
um study their function by

605
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,720
electrphysiology using patch clamp. So

606
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,360
you can get very detailed look at the

607
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,720
functional outcome uh the voltage

608
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,039
dependence of activation uh uh or lian

609
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,919
binding or kinetics of how they open how

610
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,120
they close and then in addition to that

611
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,559
annotating using this class of uh

612
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,799
proteins as an example uh annotating a

613
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,880
large number of them can be very

614
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,760
powerful to further um propel the human

615
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,320
genetic study of complex diseases as as

616
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,440
well as stratifying patient population.

617
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,760
Uh they're very critical to identify the

618
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,799
patient to go after the treatment and

619
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,880
design the precise um treatment. So with

620
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,320
that introduction

621
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,559
uh this is what I'm going to talk about

622
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:25,039
today. Uh these are

623
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:27,399
uh so here is outline. So first I'll

624
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,799
introduce what is a kac1a spectrum

625
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:34,000
disorder and then I'll describe to you

626
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,000
uh a a a couple of studies addressing

627
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,919
the missense misssense changes of

628
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,080
kakuana in a cohort of

629
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,360
neurodedevelopmental disorder and then

630
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,880
the results what can we learn from this

631
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,679
study in a cohort study of

632
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,760
neurodedevelopmental disorder and uh our

633
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,960
subsequent analysis trying to link the

634
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,679
molecular phenotype with the clinical

635
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,760
phenotype and then Lastly uh for a few

636
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,080
slides I'll talk about the strategies

637
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,399
towards a potential therapy and

638
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,559
potential nodal mechanisms underlying

639
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:09,000
these uh coding varants as um uh uh

640
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,240
powered by the letter to cure as a

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,679
pilot. So first of all what is keen1a?

642
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,760
KNO1A encodes a PQ type cal uh it's a

643
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,640
voltage gated calcium channel. It's a

644
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,120
2.1 voltage gated calcium channels and

645
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,159
then there are 10 genes encoding these

646
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,559
large transmembrane proteins. They

647
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,360
respond to voltage um changes and are

648
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,159
expressed throughout the excitable uh

649
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,399
cells in the body. Many of them are

650
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,399
expressed in the uh brain as you can

651
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,120
imagine because neurons communicate with

652
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,520
electrical signals. So keen 1A is right

653
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,919
here. uh it's one of the this is

654
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,799
family the cap one family cap 2 family

655
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,120
and cap 3. So kak1a is right here it's

656
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,679
expressed widely throughout the central

657
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,000
nervous system and also present in the

658
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,159
peripheral nervous system. It mediates

659
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,200
the neurotransmitter release at the

660
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,440
majority of the pressaptic terminals in

661
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,080
the central nervous system and mediate

662
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,480
excitability uh both neurotransmission

663
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,880
and at the uh soma for the excitability.

664
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,799
The reason it was was originally called

665
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,679
Ptype channel is because it was

666
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,240
initially identified in piking cells and

667
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,440
then back then that that was uh

668
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:29,120
initially called ptype channels and then

669
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,000
the structure of uh the let me see if I

670
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,760
can uh it doesn't play um the structure

671
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,880
of the kek1a has been

672
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,679
um published and then so this could be a

673
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,840
starting point for uh structural

674
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,840
assisted uh rational design and it's

675
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,320
also one advantage when we're going

676
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:54,039
after the precision medicine. So this is

677
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:58,080
a uh a table that I take from technoma

678
00:30:54,039 --> 00:31:00,559
foundation. Uh there are many um

679
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,000
phenotypes or clinical manifestations

680
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,320
that have been annotated for people with

681
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,320
kag1a mutations.

682
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,440
Some of them has been well described for

683
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,760
example the hemiplatic uh familial uh

684
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,480
hemopleic migraine some of them are

685
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,240
sporadic and sometimes you see them in

686
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,760
the people harboring these mutations

687
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,320
sometimes you don't and it's spread

688
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,880
across uh quite a different domain so

689
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,960
it's very difficult to grasp in in what

690
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
is the connection between the mutation

691
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,760
or what type of mutation to the clinical

692
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:41,919
manifestation. So we started to ask the

693
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:45,279
question utilizing a um a published

694
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,000
result of the um neurodedevelopmental

695
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:52,399
disorder. So what we did in this context

696
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,279
is to take uh the axom changes in the

697
00:31:52,399 --> 00:32:00,320
cacao 1A from a 31,000 trail patients.

698
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,679
Okay. So in this cohort 49 individuals

699
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,760
has contained misssense changes and only

700
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,519
four individuals with protein truncating

701
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,960
variants. So misssense changes are

702
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,799
dominating in this in this cohort. Uh a

703
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,720
few variants have been documented before

704
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,200
but the majority of them are with

705
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,200
unknown

706
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:24,640
function. Okay. Um so we take this

707
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,480
entire alic series of denovo mutations

708
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,120
of the kac no 1a and uh summarized here

709
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,760
including the 42 unique denovo variants

710
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,480
and this is coming from 36 unique coding

711
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,960
changes that I just described to you

712
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,919
from the previous cohort and we added

713
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,039
six additional novel denovo mischange

714
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,679
coming from the clinic in uh Dr. Hbiggs

715
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,880
in chop and then Dr. the jury at uh

716
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,840
Boston Children's. This con comprised of

717
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,799
42 unique denovo mutations. Taken

718
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,960
together, we also added eight most

719
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,120
frequent missense changes in the general

720
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,360
population and we wanted to include the

721
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,840
nomad mutation to give us a sense of

722
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,559
what the true wild type range of that

723
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,919
functional activity is. And then here is

724
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,519
a topology of the channel where um for

725
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,440
those of you who are not familiar with

726
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,159
this large protein, they're roughly

727
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,360
divided into four transmembrane domains

728
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,840
and each domain is uh uh composed of the

729
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,760
six trans membrane segment and then they

730
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,760
come together wrapped together to form

731
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,320
the central ionic pole um in the middle.

732
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,440
So here uh the the red dots represent

733
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,519
the disease associated missense changes

734
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,679
across the channel. You can see most of

735
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,840
them are located in the transmembrane

736
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,679
region and then the green dots are

737
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,600
represented um

738
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,080
here representing the nomad variants and

739
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,240
then they're mostly uh located actually

740
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,840
in the loop region and right here you

741
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,840
see some segregation of where the

742
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,480
mutations um coming

743
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,519
from and I I'll skip this slide and this

744
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,279
is describing the the overall uh how do

745
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,599
we choose this um the nomat varants. So

746
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,399
as I mentioned one of the advantage of

747
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:17,679
this class of um um proteins is that you

748
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,399
can study them with a huge uh amount of

749
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,119
precision. So the way we study them is

750
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,760
uh electrphysiology. These channels are

751
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,839
broadly broadly described in open state

752
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,560
and then closed state and inactivated

753
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,200
state. So typically they're sitting at

754
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,000
um closed state and then when the

755
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,359
membrane potential change they um become

756
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,960
open with open probability increasing

757
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,760
and then sometimes they go into

758
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,520
inactivated stage um where it's very

759
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,359
difficult for them to open again but

760
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,679
then they have to go back to the closed

761
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,879
state before they can open. So we can

762
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,359
devise the protocols to precisely probe

763
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,839
um their transition between the open

764
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,960
closed inactivated as well as the

765
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,280
kinetics of how they do that. And then

766
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,760
here uh I probably will show some

767
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,880
graphs. This is what what we call it the

768
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,200
the IV uh relationship current voltage

769
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,520
relationship. And then most often we

770
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,079
define how they open and how they

771
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,240
inactivate with this with this graph we

772
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,640
called uh voltage dependence of

773
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,400
inactivation and activation. This is

774
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,520
activation curve and this is

775
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,520
inactivation

776
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,560
curve. Um and then the technology that

777
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,760
enabled us to

778
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:38,720
query almost uh 50 plus variants in this

779
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,960
gene is a couple of technologies. One is

780
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,599
a maxiteon that can transact large uh

781
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,119
cDNAs very efficiently and another

782
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:54,079
technology that allow us to be able to

783
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:57,359
um patch on uh a whole chip of 384 well

784
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,599
plates. Um that is the huge incre

785
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,320
improvement on the typically very

786
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,960
laborious manual patch clamp. And then

787
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,480
we did that for all of these 50

788
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,560
variants. I'm going to jump through the

789
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,599
technical side and then the this is the

790
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,839
first result. Uh when we first saw this

791
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,800
we are very surprised. Basically you can

792
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,200
view this on the y-axis is how much of a

793
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,680
currents that we can see from each of

794
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,160
the variant channel and this is oh I

795
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,200
don't know why I don't have the label

796
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,640
but this is basically the wild type and

797
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,640
each of this bar represent one variant

798
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,200
and different color represent different

799
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,400
domains. So and then here at the gray

800
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,040
bars are all nomad uh variants. So right

801
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,839
here you can see nomads behave more or

802
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,480
less like a wild type. However, near

803
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,640
half of the variants uh from the disease

804
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,040
uh from this neurodedevelopmental cohort

805
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,440
do not show current density. We're quite

806
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,839
surprised by that because it wasn't

807
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,640
obvious because we thought if if just

808
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,359
losing half of the channel uh losing

809
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,839
half of the copy of the channel would be

810
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,400
the main uh contributor we should have

811
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,240
seen that in the PTV uh truncating

812
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,400
variant and hold the thought I'll come

813
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,079
back to that and here is um another

814
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,520
example just gave you some views of how

815
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,720
these variants behave and so these are

816
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,560
three uh different examples of of of the

817
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,280
variant that calls the gangoff function

818
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,359
what we call um in the sense where they

819
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,240
all shift the voltage dependence of

820
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,480
activation which is here to the left

821
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,800
hugely however they don't behave very

822
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,160
this very much the same as one of the

823
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,920
variant here which is a

824
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,880
V1393M also shifted voltage dependence

825
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,160
of inactivation to the

826
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,000
left at any rate here is a summary of um

827
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,200
the rest of the variants that we can

828
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,920
detect uh the currents. Um, overall all

829
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,000
but one coding changes induced at least

830
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,359
one significant change in one of the

831
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,920
five uh key biohysical parameters that

832
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,920
we interrogated compared with the wild

833
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,920
type reference channel. So half of the

834
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,400
channel disease associated channel did

835
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,640
not express and then for the rest of

836
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,720
them uh we characterize about physical

837
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,520
properties and then I wanted to draw

838
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,720
your attention to right here this is the

839
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,079
half point of activation. So you can see

840
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,359
with the remaining of the variants uh

841
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,960
nearly half if not more of the the the

842
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,880
remaining of the variants shifted the

843
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,839
voltage dependence of activation to the

844
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,960
left and and some of them shifted as

845
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,880
much as 20 millolts. This is this is

846
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,040
this is like uh um astronomically huge

847
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,160
for electrophysiology.

848
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,560
So um this is what we get um and you

849
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,160
know we're trying to understand where in

850
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,960
the structural domain that may

851
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,040
contribute to different uh deficits in

852
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,599
the biohysical uh u uh properties. So so

853
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,680
for example we we draw these radar plots

854
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,960
where um uh the pentagon each vertex

855
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,480
represent a property. So the wild type

856
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,800
is uh right at the zero uh line and then

857
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,440
you can see the nomad most of the nomad

858
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,800
fall right on the zero axis and

859
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,720
suggesting that across all five property

860
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,440
domains they're behaving more or less

861
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,560
similar to the wild type channels yt

862
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,119
type uh reference channels and then if

863
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,599
you look at the if you look at the

864
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,040
different domains so for example in

865
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:43,520
domain three a lot of variants

866
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,920
go hyperpolarized direction. So in this

867
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,040
case is basically allowing more calcium

868
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,000
influx um and and then compared to the

869
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,960
domain four where there is only one

870
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,320
pentagon plotted here because most of

871
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,280
the variants in domain four uh do not

872
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,920
express or uh with

873
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,839
undetectable current density that we can

874
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,320
measure.

875
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,560
So I'll skip this slide and we we start

876
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,920
to get some structural insights and

877
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,079
structural hotspot and of where when you

878
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,960
have a change then you start to modify

879
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,640
which aspect of the biohysical property

880
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,160
but I I wanted to share with you um of a

881
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,800
uh how how do we use this data set to to

882
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,839
compare with our missense prediction. So

883
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,920
this is done by sewway in Mark's lab. Uh

884
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,000
basically we wanted to test our

885
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,720
functional annotation. How does that

886
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,960
compare with ARA missense? So ARA

887
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:48,400
missense get um 39 of the 41 uh uh

888
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,720
impactful variants uh as correctly

889
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,320
annotated as pathogenic and then they

890
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,280
get one out of seven nomad rung on on

891
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,280
the other direction. So it's fairly

892
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,839
good. It's not perfect. It's it's it's

893
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,680
okay. And one of the things I wanted to

894
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,760
say about the alpha missense which is

895
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,280
depicted here is that that the alpha

896
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,400
sense despite its relative uh uh

897
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,680
accuracy in predicting the pathogenicity

898
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,280
it does not does not tell you the

899
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,839
directionality and as I I will show you

900
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,800
later both gain of function and loss of

901
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,040
function are implicated in the uh this

902
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,359
disease cohort and and then so

903
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,040
segregating them becomes very very

904
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,599
important. So after validating the the

905
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,079
the ARM missense and using our

906
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,480
functional data we use the ARSense to

907
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,720
look at additional disease cohorts. So

908
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,920
the results is here if we use the alpha

909
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,880
missense pathogenicity score you can see

910
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,640
that the kactton 1A for the missense

911
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,520
variants is uh significantly enriched in

912
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,480
the epileptic encphilosopathy and it's

913
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,400
not so much in the genet in the genetic

914
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,760
generalized epilepsy rather the PTVs are

915
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,480
slightly more uh enriched in the in the

916
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,160
GGE so right here it seems to suggest

917
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,880
that there's some segregation

918
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,280
between the PTVs and the misssense um uh

919
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:18,160
changes. So I'll skip this slide but I

920
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,079
wanted to tell you some uh because we c

921
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,839
categorize different domains of the

922
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,599
property and sometimes it's so for

923
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,880
example if you have reduced current

924
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,119
density however you still left shift in

925
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,359
the activation threshold. So we wanted

926
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,319
to have a method to have a combined

927
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,119
physiological output as a prediction of

928
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,480
how does it impact the neurono

929
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,040
excitability. I won't go through this

930
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,920
but we we did that and the reason we did

931
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,160
that is that we wanted to be able to

932
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,400
have a better uh look between the

933
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,880
cellular phenotype from these variants

934
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,240
the impact of the biohysical

935
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,800
uh impact with the clinical

936
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,960
manifestation. So to do that we um so

937
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,200
here is a three parameter we measured

938
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,680
and here are the four parameters that we

939
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,440
modeled using uh using this uh neuron

940
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,599
simulations and then I'll just um go

941
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,280
directly to some of the insights here.

942
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:20,079
So for example, we found that current

943
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,560
current density increase and voltage uh

944
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,440
voltage dependence of activation shift

945
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:29,040
is really uh significantly associated

946
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,480
with a severe form of epilepsy. And then

947
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,599
the the the the reduction of the current

948
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,680
density is more associated with episotic

949
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,960
atexia. Not necessarily at taxia but

950
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,079
episodic taxia and hemibbleic migraine

951
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,520
and is really only

952
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,040
associated at least in this data set

953
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,200
which is which is uh you

954
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,440
know 80 patients with 22 unique uh

955
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,680
variants is mainly associated with

956
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,040
voltage dependence of activation. And

957
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,280
I'll show you one uh example of how we

958
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:07,960
start to obtain more insights onto this

959
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,319
uh um variant property to clinical um uh

960
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,960
relationship. So what I'm showing you

961
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,760
here are two different types of uh

962
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:20,160
perhaps most frequent recurring

963
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:23,200
variants. Here is a A713. Here is uh two

964
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,359
very close mutations and that has very

965
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,200
similar property which is shown here.

966
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:30,160
All of them shift the voltage dependence

967
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,319
of activation to the left. However, the

968
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,040
difference between this two class is

969
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,960
that the

970
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,280
1349Q also shift the voltage dependence

971
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,280
of

972
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,760
inactivation. So as the result you can

973
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,319
see clinically they have slightly

974
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:51,720
different um manifestation. So for

975
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:53,319
example, A713 people who harbor A7 A713T

976
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,040
mutation

977
00:44:53,319 --> 00:45:00,079
are you see more of them with this uh

978
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,880
very severe form of epilepsy but you

979
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:06,280
almost don't see them in the uh

980
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,599
hemoplegic migraine on the opposite the

981
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:12,400
R1340Q and

982
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:14,800
R1352Q have a expressed uh uh

983
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,960
manifestation clinically in hemopleic

984
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,599
migraine. So we wanted to do this

985
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,800
correlation to give us a better handle

986
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,040
on the um mutation impact and the

987
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,640
clinical

988
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,119
manifestation. So here is what I've told

989
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,160
you so far. We characterize a function

990
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:36,280
of 50 variants. 42 of them are denovo

991
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,680
changes of keen 1A where stricken by how

992
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,240
impactful of nearly every one of of

993
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,119
these denovo mutations. And then we

994
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,440
started to infer the genotype, cellular

995
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,160
phenotype and the human phenotype in the

996
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,640
caca uh spectrum disorder and hope to

997
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,800
delineate a little better correlation

998
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,520
for the physicians as well as for

999
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,160
understanding the disease

1000
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:02,079
mechanism. And I would argue that um uh

1001
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,520
understanding the function of rare

1002
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,599
coding changes of this class of protein

1003
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,240
may start to bridge the gap between the

1004
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,680
monogenic disorder and complex uh uh

1005
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:16,240
channelopathy. So where do we go from

1006
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,200
here? And we're grateful very grateful

1007
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:22,160
to to the support for the pilot um from

1008
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,560
the letter to cure accelerator program.

1009
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,319
So there are two key um directions that

1010
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,359
we're going to go and we already started

1011
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,520
in both directions. So one is to uh

1012
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:35,200
identify the nodal mechanism in disease

1013
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,520
associated with K1A uh varants uh and

1014
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,920
spectrum disorders. We already

1015
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,079
identified the two key phenotype one

1016
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,640
molecular phenotype. One is a voltage

1017
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,280
dependence of activation. The other one

1018
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,599
is basically we do not see much currents

1019
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,680
on the surface. So we're going after

1020
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,640
both of them and I'll uh we're starting

1021
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:58,000
to constructing the prototype um cell

1022
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,240
lines that showing very sim showing

1023
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,480
these class the the the prototype

1024
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,960
representing the whole spectrum and then

1025
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,520
the goal is to screen for modulators to

1026
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,880
address potent these two potential modem

1027
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:13,520
mechanisms for the kek 1A spectrum

1028
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,560
uh mutation disorder. And then the

1029
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,960
second study is to collaborate with uh

1030
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,800
Chong lab as Wendy is collects a

1031
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,200
detailed health information and medical

1032
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,440
data from individuals with keen related

1033
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,560
disorders for the natural history study.

1034
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,800
She already collected 156 individuals in

1035
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,119
her database and we're starting to

1036
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,119
address all of the missenses in her

1037
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,880
database. uh we already in this study

1038
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,880
we're already performed we have 20 of

1039
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,640
them and then so we're we're looking to

1040
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,240
characterize the rest of them and then

1041
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,800
to map back with the clinical um uh

1042
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,839
details and potentially identify the

1043
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,040
biomarkers and just very quickly here we

1044
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:57,040
already constructed in

1045
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,520
uh almost a dozen of the cell lines

1046
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,119
representing the prototype of the two

1047
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,839
potential nodal mechanism and uh we have

1048
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,000
constructed ed a um cell line that we

1049
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:11,839
can read out the calcium influx through

1050
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,240
these channels um using a Gamp uh six

1051
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,720
that tether to the membrane to increase

1052
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,200
uh signal to noise ratio and we're very

1053
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,440
excited that this will launch us to the

1054
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,480
next stage of screen for the repurpose

1055
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,359
library and and identify potentially

1056
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,240
clinical ready uh compounds that we can

1057
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,640
test. So with that I wanted to thank um

1058
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,400
the four people who contributed majorly

1059
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:40,079
to this project and collaborators um Wii

1060
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,720
in the uh audience and then uh Wendy and

1061
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,520
many of the support over the past few

1062
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,520
years. Thank you.

1063
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,480
All right. Next up we have Dr. Lee Rubin

1064
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,640
who is principal faculty at the Harvard

1065
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,000
Stem Cell Institute where his lab

1066
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,640
focuses on mechanisms of

1067
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,400
neurodeenerative diseases um and

1068
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,319
identifying preINDD um compounds for

1069
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,319
translational purposes um which he has

1070
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,160
done successfully several times over the

1071
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,880
course of his career. In addition, he's

1072
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,359
an expert in modeling neurodeenerative

1073
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,520
diseases um specifically from patient

1074
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:20,240
specific differentiated neurons um with

1075
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,160
a focus on Parkinson's disease, SMA and

1076
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,880
ALS. Um and he's going to tell you more

1077
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:28,319
about his L2C project. Thank you, Lee.

1078
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,760
Thanks, Jillian. Um so, I'm really happy

1079
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,480
to be here today and I'm going to talk

1080
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,880
about a pro project that with the good

1081
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,880
graces of Anna and Jillian and the L2C

1082
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,240
program, we've been able to resurrect in

1083
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,240
the lab. And I'm gonna in in particular

1084
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,920
talk about a disease that probably all

1085
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,000
of you have heard of, spinal muscular

1086
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,440
atrophy. This was not so much the case

1087
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,280
10-ish years ago, but it certainly is

1088
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:53,760
now. Um, spinal muscular atrophy and

1089
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,960
cystic fibrosis are probably the poster

1090
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,440
children for studies of rare diseases.

1091
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,880
They're not so rare in the sense of what

1092
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,000
we're talking about here today. They're

1093
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,880
about 20,000 or so kids with both of

1094
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,599
them, I think, cystic fibrosis and SMA.

1095
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,440
But it's a fairly well understood

1096
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,040
disease and probably all of you know it.

1097
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:18,640
I'll just quickly say right now. Um the

1098
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:22,400
disease spinal muscular atrophy was was

1099
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:26,480
and is referred to as a motor monogenic

1100
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,400
motor neuron pediatric disease and it's

1101
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,720
due to a reduction in the level of a

1102
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,119
protein of slightly incompletely

1103
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,800
understood function called survival of

1104
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:41,680
motor neuron. Survival of motor neuron

1105
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,079
is coded for by two genes. one of which

1106
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,559
is SMN1 and the other of which is a

1107
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,119
duplicated gene with a misssense

1108
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,760
mutation called

1109
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:56,119
SMN2 and it exists in various dis uh

1110
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:59,800
degrees of severity um uh very very very

1111
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:02,800
severe which is called type one until

1112
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,520
recently kids with type one SMA died

1113
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,160
before the age of one then type two

1114
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,160
where kids would be um more severely

1115
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,960
handicapped and finally the mildest type

1116
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,720
type three where kids could live on a a

1117
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,640
normal lifespan maybe they'd be in a

1118
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,440
wheelchair later in life and what

1119
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,880
distinguishes one from two from three is

1120
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,839
the number of copies of the SMN2 gene.

1121
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,839
So this is fairly well understood and it

1122
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:30,559
led to without with incomplete

1123
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:33,760
understanding of the disease. The um

1124
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,240
hypothesis which is seemingly very true

1125
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,960
that the more SMN protein you have the

1126
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:43,040
better you are. And based on that

1127
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,559
hypothesis as probably many of you know

1128
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,680
there are currently three approved

1129
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:51,200
therapeutics. One of which is a gene

1130
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,599
therapy that delivers the wild type SMN1

1131
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,920
gene. the other two of which are

1132
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,599
splicing modulators. One is an ao

1133
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,920
anticens nucleotide delivered

1134
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,920
intratheally and the other is a small

1135
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,920
molecule um splicing modulator in fact a

1136
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,640
relative of branoplam that we just heard

1137
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,680
from recently which was originally uh uh

1138
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,920
developed by Novartis as an SMA drug.

1139
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,160
Now given what I just said you may be

1140
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,240
wondering why I'm talking to you today

1141
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:22,960
about SMA. It's cured sort of cured. Um

1142
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,680
and I'm going to tell you why um our

1143
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,920
stubbornness about the value things that

1144
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,200
we've discovered using an approach that

1145
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,440
was somewhat different from everything

1146
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,079
else that was used in the field which uh

1147
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,640
uh Jillian already mentioned using IPS

1148
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:40,319
cells from patients that had different

1149
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,079
degrees of SMA severity how that led to

1150
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,680
what we felt were very interesting

1151
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,359
insights which is what I'm going to

1152
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,040
describe to you today. So I'm going to

1153
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,839
talk a little bit specifically about

1154
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,960
SMA. I'm going to talk um in some detail

1155
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,680
about SMA motor neurons and how they

1156
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,400
behave. Then I'm going to talk about

1157
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,880
other surprising observations that we

1158
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,599
made using IPS cells made from the kids

1159
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,920
with SMA and a general principle that

1160
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,480
I'd like to put forward uh uh today

1161
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:12,240
about broadening the way we think about

1162
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:15,839
using IPS cells. Um uh and um I'd also

1163
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,559
like to um uh uh bring in this idea that

1164
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,960
in the case of SMA and this is I think

1165
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:24,079
will turn out to be key to this program.

1166
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,720
We hypothesize that the carriers of SMA

1167
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,520
the parents of which there are 7 million

1168
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,760
in the US are also many of them

1169
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,520
phenotypically abnormal and might

1170
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:37,200
themselves benefit from an SMA drug. So

1171
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,640
it's a little bit specific but we're

1172
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,599
trying to establish some principles

1173
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:46,559
here. Okay. So, um uh what we found very

1174
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,160
early on as having made iPSLs from a

1175
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,640
bunch of kids with SMA, as I said, and

1176
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,040
making motor neurons, it was certainly

1177
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,280
the case that we could do what everybody

1178
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,920
was trying to do at the time with any

1179
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,240
disease, which is to say you reproduce

1180
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,400
in try to reproduce in culture the thing

1181
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,160
that you know about the disease. And

1182
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,880
since it was called a motor neuron

1183
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,720
disease, we tried to reproduce motor

1184
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,400
neuron uh death starting from patient

1185
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:15,200
cells. Well, this was relatively easy in

1186
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,920
SMA unlike all the late onset diseases

1187
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,119
like ALS. ALS is another motor neuron

1188
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,880
disease, but it's genetically very

1189
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:25,839
heterogeneous and and late onset. This

1190
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,760
is early onset monogenic. Seemed like it

1191
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,079
would be easy and in fact relatively

1192
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,920
speaking, it was easy. So we could show

1193
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,319
this from patient derived motor neurons

1194
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,240
and even here I'm just showing you these

1195
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,839
are just wild type motor neurons in

1196
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:42,160
which we just um reduce the level of of

1197
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,319
SMN and you can see that this kind of

1198
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,640
rapidly induces the death of motor

1199
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:50,720
neurons. Nothing um at all surprising

1200
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,520
there. The thing that was surprising

1201
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,400
though is that we looked at the cultures

1202
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,280
in great detail by imaging and I'm going

1203
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:02,480
to show you more imaging later on. Um

1204
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,960
now done here what we observed was

1205
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,559
unlike what we imagined that every motor

1206
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,599
neuron in the culture would have the

1207
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,319
same level of SMN protein this was not

1208
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,720
true. In fact there was wide variation

1209
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:18,319
in the level of protein in individual

1210
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:22,240
motor neurons such that some had much

1211
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:25,440
much lower levels of SMN than others. Um

1212
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:29,200
and um it turned out that the effect on

1213
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,520
motor neuron survival of reducing SMN um

1214
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,040
or when studying patient cells was not

1215
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:38,559
uniform um and and in fact what we

1216
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:41,520
observed was um this so we plotted out

1217
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,160
the individual cell levels of SMN. So

1218
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,599
this is intensity and every culture

1219
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:50,640
whether it's from SMA uh IPS cells or

1220
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:54,799
wild type IPS cells had a distribution

1221
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,720
of SMN. So as a population you could see

1222
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,640
that SMN was really low in the

1223
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,280
population. But even that severely

1224
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:04,079
affected population still had motororns

1225
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,520
that had relatively high normal levels

1226
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,640
of SMN. And it turned out that the cells

1227
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,000
that had low levels of SMN in one single

1228
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,160
well had higher probability of dying.

1229
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,760
And this was um seen by following the

1230
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,359
cells over time and ultimately staining

1231
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:26,480
them with uh uh um cleaved caspace um uh

1232
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:29,760
antibbody. So the effect of reducing SMN

1233
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:33,599
is preferentially on cells that happen

1234
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,240
to have low levels of SMN protein.

1235
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,240
Okay, that's

1236
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:43,520
SMA. Now, we also observe the converse.

1237
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:47,280
If we took motor SMA motor neuron motor

1238
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:50,400
neurons and uh overexpressed SMN using a

1239
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:53,599
viral viral delivery in those cells, um

1240
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,680
SMN the SMN histogram would shift to the

1241
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,839
higher

1242
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:01,200
values and again that was associated

1243
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:04,559
with increased survival. So increasing

1244
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,960
SMN decreasing reduced survival

1245
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,520
preferentially by affecting low SMN

1246
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,160
motor neurons if you shift the profile

1247
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,000
so that more cells have normal or high

1248
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:19,040
levels the survival of those cells

1249
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,079
increases. In other words in SMA it at

1250
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,480
the single cell level the amount of SMN

1251
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,520
that they have dictates their life or

1252
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,280
death. So you can see this in as an

1253
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,040
average but more importantly you could

1254
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,359
see this at individual cells. So why is

1255
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,960
that interesting? So it turns out every

1256
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:37,359
type of motor neuron, every type of

1257
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,599
motor neuron culture, no matter where

1258
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:43,200
they, no matter where IPS cells came

1259
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:46,640
from, ALS, any genetic version of ALS,

1260
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,720
SMA, any type of SMA patient, wild type

1261
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,280
motor neurons for which whoever the

1262
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,559
donor is, we always see a histogram of

1263
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,280
levels, it's always the case that the

1264
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:00,640
lower the cells in the culture with

1265
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,280
lower SMN die preferentially. And it's

1266
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,240
always the case importantly that

1267
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,720
increasing SMN in these cultures even if

1268
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,680
they're wild type motor neurons even if

1269
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,480
they're ALS derived motor neurons the

1270
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,640
survival of these cells is always

1271
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,760
improved. In other words as a summary

1272
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,400
statement the protein survival of motor

1273
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,200
neuron does exactly what the name

1274
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,640
suggests. It improves the survival of

1275
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:32,520
motor neurons regardless of where the

1276
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:36,400
the source of the cells. Okay.

1277
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:38,400
So it is even true and in fact I won't

1278
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,240
have time to tell you about this. It is

1279
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,400
even true if you take a wild type

1280
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,839
culture of motor neurons and treat it

1281
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:48,000
with toxic compounds. Toxic means that

1282
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:51,440
it decreases the number of motor neurons

1283
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,599
in the well. You often find compounds

1284
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,240
that decrease the total number of

1285
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:59,359
modinors while increasing the average

1286
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,440
value of SMN in the well. And the way

1287
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:03,839
that happens is even toxic compounds

1288
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:08,400
many of which are shown here shift the

1289
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:12,640
profile by selectively re um eliminating

1290
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:15,839
the cells with low SMN leaving behind a

1291
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:18,480
smaller number of cells but cells with

1292
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:20,720
higher SMN. So the number goes down the

1293
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,119
average SMN goes up. So under any

1294
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,400
circumstance that we have tried whether

1295
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,559
it's straight toxic compounds um a

1296
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,280
disease phenotype of any kind if we make

1297
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:34,119
motor neurons the higher SMN they have

1298
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,520
the better they survive.

1299
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:40,319
Okay. Okay. So um this I won't talk

1300
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,640
about now but it leads you to wonder and

1301
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:45,839
this is part of the new program if that

1302
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,680
is true. It suggests the idea that a

1303
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,240
compound that increases SMN might be

1304
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,599
therapeutic for nonSMN motor neuron

1305
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:55,040
diseases. Let's just say ALS. And if you

1306
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,280
were thinking about that, you would also

1307
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,240
have to think about what is the best way

1308
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,359
of increasing SMN um in in those

1309
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:06,079
cultures. And we act in our hands with

1310
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:08,319
IPS cells, the best way of doing it even

1311
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,480
compared to the approved splicing

1312
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,799
modulator is by blocking the degradation

1313
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,240
of SMN protein. That's part of our new

1314
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:15,920
project and and I'll talk about it

1315
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,000
later, but I won't show the these data.

1316
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,359
Okay. So, I I think this was a

1317
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,200
relatively simple story, but I've

1318
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,920
summarized it here. There's cellto cell

1319
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,839
variation in the amount of SMN protein

1320
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,119
in every single culture we've ever seen.

1321
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:32,240
Mouse, human, ALS, SMA. Um, higher

1322
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:34,400
levels of uh SMN protein protein

1323
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,880
increase the survival of motor neurons.

1324
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,960
Full stop. Um, this suggests that

1325
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,599
therapeutics that increase SMN may also

1326
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,079
be able to treat ALS. So um that's

1327
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,880
that's our hypothesis and again what is

1328
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,880
the best type of SMN elevating

1329
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:53,119
therapeutic that we believe would work

1330
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:57,200
outside of the disease SMA okay now

1331
01:00:53,119 --> 01:01:00,319
there's a second part um to this and

1332
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,960
this is kind of this question are motor

1333
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:07,599
neurons really the only cells um

1334
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:09,280
affected in in in kids with SMA now what

1335
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,280
even though it's always been thought to

1336
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,520
be a motor neuron disease There's reason

1337
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,520
to wonder if that's really true and and

1338
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,440
the one of the main reasons is the gene

1339
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,319
is ubiquitously expressed and this is

1340
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:24,079
from the uh broad gtex portal. Um and in

1341
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:26,880
fact motors um do not have by far the

1342
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,400
highest level of SMN. There are other

1343
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,720
types of cells that have much much much

1344
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,480
higher levels of SN. So it suggested the

1345
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,240
possibility that there might be for

1346
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,319
instance if kids were to live longer it

1347
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,760
might be the possibility that you one

1348
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:45,280
would observe other tissues being

1349
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:47,920
affected. So um this uh really the our

1350
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,680
interest in this stemmed from our

1351
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,359
observation that when we made a bunch of

1352
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,319
IPS cells from kids with SMA they were

1353
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:58,400
pur potent in the technical using the

1354
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:02,200
technical definition of pur potency

1355
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:05,440
which is the the IPS cells made endoderm

1356
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:07,880
misoderm and ectoaderm but they didn't

1357
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,640
do it normally they had clear

1358
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,720
differentiation defects and in fact

1359
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:16,000
they're surprising defects. One of them

1360
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:19,040
is they make neural ectoermal cells

1361
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,280
including motor neurons much better than

1362
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,559
wild type cells. So you generate a lot

1363
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,079
of motor and they die quickly. So it's a

1364
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:28,480
degenerative phenotype for motor neurons

1365
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:31,440
but they're born perfectly nicely. On

1366
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:34,079
the other hand, cells of endodermal

1367
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,720
origin are not produced well from the

1368
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:39,000
very same IPS cells. So just to kind of

1369
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,520
illustrate that on the top left are

1370
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,400
endoderm cells and you can see the SMA

1371
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:47,920
ones are really uh defective in in their

1372
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:50,319
production. Um skeletal muscle is highly

1373
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,400
defective in its production from IPS

1374
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:55,839
cells. I'll emphasize this now because

1375
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,920
it's very clear that kids with SMA have

1376
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,799
skeletal muscle defects independent of

1377
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,160
the motor neuron defects. And in fact,

1378
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:05,200
there are several clinical trials

1379
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,839
underway now to just make muscles

1380
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:10,640
stronger even in kids who have received

1381
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:12,559
SMA therapies. So this seems to be on

1382
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,039
the right track. And we also found some

1383
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,839
cardiac defects. But the cells most

1384
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,839
affected were endodermal derived. And

1385
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,839
this shows um a figure from a recent

1386
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,520
paper that we published in the journal

1387
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,359
of clinical investigation with Crystal

1388
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,920
Yo. And there were two interesting

1389
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:30,960
things here. One is that we could

1390
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:33,039
reproduce um hpatic a liver der endoderm

1391
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,680
derived liver cell defects starting with

1392
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,839
patient IPS cells but more importantly

1393
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,960
it illustrates the other general finding

1394
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:44,480
we had which is cells do not have equal

1395
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,480
sensitivity to loss of SMN. So in fact

1396
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,880
the cells that are most sensitive to

1397
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,440
reduction of SMN are endoderm derived

1398
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:54,280
cells and in this particular paper there

1399
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:58,160
we showed a clear phenotype with

1400
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:00,079
carriers hetererozygous IPS cells. They

1401
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,000
clearly had a very strong liver defect.

1402
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,039
So you didn't need to not you needed to

1403
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,119
to reduce the protein level only 50% for

1404
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,359
those cells to be affected. You didn't

1405
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,119
need to go down to close to zero for the

1406
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:14,240
cells to be effective. So this suggests

1407
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,960
a range of sensitivity and also suggests

1408
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,119
that if any of this IPS stuff is to be

1409
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,280
believed. It also suggests that if you

1410
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,520
look carefully at patients perhaps you

1411
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,359
would find things that you didn't that

1412
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,520
you didn't already know about. So I want

1413
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:30,640
to say that one again. Everybody who

1414
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:32,720
uses IPSLs uses them to model the parts

1415
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,559
of the dis of a disease that you

1416
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,200
understand.

1417
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,520
But for IPSLs to be really believable,

1418
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,680
you should also sort of imagine that

1419
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,839
IPSLs could tell you things you didn't

1420
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,920
already know if they're really truly

1421
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:48,240
representative of the patients. So that

1422
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,839
became kind of for us a big deal. Is

1423
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,839
this, you know, it's just an artifact of

1424
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:53,920
IPS cell biology? It's an artifact of

1425
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,960
cell culture. And so we were quite

1426
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:00,160
interested in this. And finally um after

1427
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:03,119
a lot of struggling via um uh Zakohan's

1428
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:05,440
lab at at uh Harvard Medical School was

1429
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,520
um Scott Lipnik who was a computational

1430
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,799
biologist in my lab at the time we got

1431
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:13,599
access to an Etna electronic health

1432
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:16,240
database with a patient dise ICD codes

1433
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:19,039
patient disease diagnoses that were used

1434
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:22,480
for billing purposes. These records are

1435
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,799
not the best in the world. um but we had

1436
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,520
60 million of them and from that we

1437
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:30,000
identified about 1,300 kids with SMA and

1438
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:32,319
I'll also mention by imputation about

1439
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,200
2600 carriers of SMA. I'm going to come

1440
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:38,319
back to that and we found sure enough um

1441
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,240
before um neuromuscular diseases were

1442
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:42,319
diagnosed in these kids. They had a

1443
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,000
variety of other disorders listed

1444
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:46,880
clearly on their health records

1445
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,880
including cardiac and um endodermal

1446
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,119
tissue derived disorders. So that was

1447
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,880
kind of interesting. If you are if you

1448
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,880
are imaginative enough or want to be

1449
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:58,559
believe this enough, you could imagine

1450
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:01,680
that actually IPSLs in fact do reproduce

1451
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,359
aspects of of the patient biology under

1452
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,960
the correct settings and we can debate

1453
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:09,839
what those settings are. Okay.

1454
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:11,440
So that's second part. Multiple tissues

1455
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:13,440
may be affect may be affected well

1456
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,960
clearly are affected in SMA patients.

1457
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,160
And I want to emphasize one thing. I

1458
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,240
don't know if physicians will agree with

1459
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,039
me or not. SMA is a neurological

1460
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,960
disorder. Neurologists are examining the

1461
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,720
patients. The kid the thing the

1462
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,160
condition that used to be killing kids

1463
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,200
with SMA is um breathing distress. I

1464
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,319
don't think the physicians are

1465
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,480
necessarily wondering about other more

1466
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,960
minor conditions that the kids have. So

1467
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,640
I want to distinguish between biological

1468
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,240
significance, things that are actually

1469
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,880
happening that are interesting maybe to

1470
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,559
some of us me um u versus clinical

1471
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,920
significance, the things that need to be

1472
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:51,280
treated immediately. Um okay. And that

1473
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,039
um again inv oops um in vitro studies

1474
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,480
indicate that some cell types are

1475
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,440
actually more sensitive than motor

1476
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,680
neurons and will ultimately give rise to

1477
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,240
disease phenotypes especially now that

1478
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,400
kids are living longer and that there

1479
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,640
are effects that are easily observable

1480
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,000
with e where where the cells have only

1481
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:14,000
lost 50% of their SMA. So this leads to

1482
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,280
this other question. Are carriers of SMA

1483
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,799
really phenotypically normal? Um and so

1484
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,200
that's the the second part of the

1485
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:24,400
project. Okay. So what are we doing?

1486
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,240
Part one plans. Um identify we're

1487
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,559
interested in what regulates the level

1488
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:33,359
of protein SMN protein in motor neurons.

1489
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:36,559
So our plan is to separate the highest

1490
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:38,400
10% from the lowest 10% and study uh

1491
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:41,039
gene expression differences in those two

1492
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,760
different populations. Um and then we're

1493
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,160
going to use phenotypic screens um uh uh

1494
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,920
to uh find compounds that let's say

1495
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,079
drive more of the low cells into the

1496
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,760
high expressor category and then

1497
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,920
ultimately to test compounds like that

1498
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,599
in different ALS models. And we've made

1499
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,920
a good start already given that we had

1500
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,079
to resurrect this project from zero even

1501
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,920
in my lab and then transfer everything

1502
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,880
over to here. But with the wonderful

1503
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:07,760
help from Moing Gishere um uh and and

1504
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,599
Masha Alen Mo that that um we've already

1505
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,520
reproduced the fact that all of these

1506
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,160
cultures do have these extended

1507
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,880
histograms of SMN intensity. So that's

1508
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,359
the core of the project. So it's good

1509
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:22,719
that we were able to see that. We've

1510
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:25,759
also um were able to show that if you by

1511
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,759
imaging distinguish between the cells in

1512
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,799
the well that have the highest 10%

1513
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:33,679
versus the lowest 10% and then look for

1514
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:35,359
by imaging other aspects of the cells

1515
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,400
biology of those cells. You can

1516
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,440
immediately see that there's a good

1517
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:42,319
correlation between let's say

1518
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:45,679
mitochondrial function looal function

1519
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:48,480
and SMN. So the highest uh SMN

1520
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:51,199
expressors also have the most intact

1521
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:53,440
mitochondria and losomes. And that's

1522
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:55,199
kind of summarized here. And again, very

1523
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,960
reassuring that even by just straight

1524
01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:01,279
imaging, we can already pick up

1525
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,040
differences. And um uh um Mary Rose

1526
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,719
branch in my lab has come over here

1527
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,400
together with the people at the fax core

1528
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:10,799
and has stained um a fixed and permeed

1529
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,600
motor neurons, stained them for SMN and

1530
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,759
then separated them by fax. And again we

1531
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,759
can easily separate the top well not

1532
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,920
easily separate the top 10% from the

1533
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,759
bottom 10%. So that's good. So that now

1534
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,640
lets us move forward with the first part

1535
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:27,120
of the project. Now part two which is

1536
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,560
now computational and here we're working

1537
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:33,199
with Ben Weissberg um and Heidi Ram from

1538
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,520
the computational group here. Um, so

1539
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:38,319
we're now able, unlike when we did our

1540
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,480
first study, we can now call SMA

1541
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,359
carriers just by gene sequencing

1542
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:46,480
information, not the indirect way by ICD

1543
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:48,000
code to get the kids and then

1544
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,759
retroactively

1545
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,920
identify the parents. So, we're

1546
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:56,560
expecting about 9,000 um uh SMA carriers

1547
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,199
in the UK bio bank. So that will really

1548
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:02,239
allow us to power up and see whether or

1549
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:04,880
not it's true that these u uh uh parents

1550
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:07,520
are phenotypically um abnormal in any

1551
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,679
way using again ICD codes and also other

1552
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,000
informatic analyses of their health

1553
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,480
records. And then we're going to use the

1554
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,440
all of us uh uh uh cohort as the

1555
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,440
validation set. Um and then if all this

1556
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,520
turns out, we are ultimately interested

1557
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,560
in finding again a therapeutic that

1558
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,040
would treat the somewhat abnormal

1559
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:31,040
parents of the kids or just people who

1560
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,400
are SMA carriers. Okay, so um that's it.

1561
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,280
Thank you very much. The people in my

1562
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:37,840
lab um who did the work um really were

1563
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,840
the middle three up front there. Mary

1564
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,239
Rose is in the audience has been coming

1565
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,840
over here to do the work. Rich has been

1566
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:46,560
working with Mary Rosen. Chris next to

1567
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,159
her on the left is our our computational

1568
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,199
person. And again, I'd like to thank the

1569
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:52,960
L2C program um and um people at the

1570
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:55,960
Broad that we've been working with.

1571
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,960
Thank

1572
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:05,920
Thank you, Lee. I'd also like to invite

1573
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:08,880
Jen and Ricardo up for a quick uh Q&A.

1574
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,880
Uh a question to you, Lee. Um, it'd be

1575
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:15,120
helpful in interpreting all of your

1576
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,520
studies to know what the protein

1577
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,760
actually does.

1578
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,640
What's the status? I mean, this has been

1579
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,199
going on for a long time for sure. Um,

1580
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,159
so on the one hand, I always like to say

1581
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:29,520
to um basic, you know, very good basic

1582
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,640
scientists, it shows you just don't

1583
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,040
really have to understand everything

1584
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,199
about a disease before you treat it. But

1585
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,760
on the other hand, it is really true

1586
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:39,679
that it's a splicing modulator, but it

1587
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,080
regulates the splicing of thousands of

1588
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,320
genes. And people have always had this

1589
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,400
idea that there must be something

1590
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:50,679
especially important in motor neurons,

1591
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,679
but nobody knows what that is.

1592
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,080
I also have a question to Lee. Are you

1593
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,320
able to access uh information on

1594
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,080
patients responders and non-responders

1595
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,520
and try to correlate it with their SMN

1596
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:08,000
levels? Um I I want I haven't heard

1597
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,679
about a large number of nonresponders to

1598
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,920
one of the treatments. Yeah, partial.

1599
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,840
Yeah, that's yeah, it's a really good

1600
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,320
it's a really good idea. We we need we

1601
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,280
need to look in that. I I presume so

1602
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:21,199
number the patients switch therapies and

1603
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,280
and I think there are two reasons. one

1604
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:25,040
they weren't working that well and as I

1605
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,960
guess think you know the timing of

1606
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,120
treatment is so so so important the

1607
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,239
longer you wait the less that gets

1608
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:35,199
corrected um and and the other reason is

1609
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:38,560
for example um there's a supplementation

1610
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:40,800
of gene therapy with this the oral drug

1611
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,440
some kids of course don't like getting

1612
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,280
the anti-sense you know every 3 months

1613
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,199
by intratheal administration so that's

1614
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:49,679
the other reason for switching but we

1615
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:51,360
could look into presumably how patients

1616
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,640
have responded to the treatments we

1617
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,120
haven't done that yet. It's a it's a

1618
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:57,679
good thought.

1619
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,920
Can I ask a question as well for you? So

1620
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,239
going back to the the idea of uh for

1621
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,239
example using risk the plan or brand

1622
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,520
like do do you are you thinking that

1623
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:07,520
maybe this is something that everyone

1624
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,159
should be taking a little bit like at a

1625
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:13,679
low dose maybe not everybody but that's

1626
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:15,520
that's also but you know uh uh it's come

1627
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,239
up every now and again. I would love to

1628
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,760
start with the more severely affected

1629
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:23,440
carriers just to see what how they

1630
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,800
respond. Um so it is true as you as you

1631
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,400
you're pointing out I mean since we've

1632
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,679
seen this on um motor neurons as well I

1633
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,920
I don't know if there are situations

1634
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:34,880
like after traumatic damage for example

1635
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,560
if the um nerve is cut to preserve the

1636
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,640
cell bodies better maybe it would be

1637
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:41,840
useful under those kind of circumstances

1638
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:44,480
as well.

1639
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,920
everyone for a fantastic session. Um the

1640
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,159
speakers will hang out for a little

1641
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,159
while to answer any follow-up questions.

1642
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,360
Please be back at 1:15 so we can

1643
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,660
continue with our program. Thanks

1644
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:56,949
everyone.

1645
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:56,949
[Applause]
