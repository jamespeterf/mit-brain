00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,880
hello everybody one of the great things

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
about making these videos is that we can

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,760
introduce small Concepts that otherwise

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,359
might fall through the cracks so I want

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,680
to introduce the concept of ties and how

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,439
we represent them in music 21 and how

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,199
you might represent them in your own

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,119
project so let's go ahead and import

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:34,079
from music 21 note stream and the new

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:39,280
tii module and we can go ahead and

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:42,640
create a stream of a measure we'll call

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,200
M and let's create two

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,640
notes and let's doesn't really matter

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,399
when you make them just make sure that

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
they're

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,280
um that they're at the same pitch

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,559
because otherwise we can't tie them

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,000
that's pretty good and uh we'll say

19
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,960
We'll create a time signature

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,360
it's why I usually eventually will

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,360
import Star

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,360
but

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,040
uh

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,720
to4 and let's put

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:24,560
m. append time signature m. append Note

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,560
One actually we could just put more than

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,280
one thing in and we'll show these two

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,840
notes

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,479
and now while it's doing that we'll go

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,280
ahead and get n1's tie will be a new

31
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,600
tie. TI object and it will be a start

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,520
and two tie will be a tie. TI object and

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,079
it will be stop and now where we

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:54,799
show The Measure we have what we should

35
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:58,200
have written as a half note right but we

36
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:02,799
can go ahead and let's create another

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,600
measure and here's a course um where we

38
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,879
would be more likely to do this at make

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,319
a quarter rest that's the default but

40
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,239
just to show it and so we can by the way

41
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,599
put um objects in more than one stream

42
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,200
and so this is something that's going to

43
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,599
happen

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:28,120
um sometimes we'll put the first note

45
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:31,720
in and now we'll create M3 is a stream.

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,760
measure and M three

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,680
dots

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:42,920
append and two o you know I really do

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:47,120
care about having uh all our measures

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,159
sort of appear and P is a stream. part

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,720
we go ahead and put inside the

52
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,159
stream

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,560
M2 and pend

54
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:01,319
M3 and let's go ahead and show

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,400
that great so this shows kind of how

56
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:09,840
ties might work now here's the thing if

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:11,480
we do forn in um well p. recurse do

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,280
notes and we try to figure

59
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,519
out how many notes there

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
are well looks like there's three of

61
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,560
them but if we listen to this piece

62
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,560
obviously we're just going to hear two

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,760
notes so what can we do well we can

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,920
create a new part we'll say P2 equals

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,080
part. trip

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,040
ties and now if we do forn in well

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,000
actually let's show this and we'll show

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:46,920
it as a text file we'll see here that uh

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,280
we only have two notes now but in this

70
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,040
next measure this note the C only begins

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,360
one quarter note

72
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,239
in so we've reduced what we've done is

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,400
we've taken this these two e there tied

74
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,079
and we can replace them with one half

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,799
note in fact we can look at

76
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:15,879
this that's our note

77
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,879
and duration it's a half

78
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:25,080
note when we strip ties we create things

79
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,320
sometimes that don't really musically

80
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,960
exists we have a measure that has a tie

81
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,680
signature of 24 has a quarter rest and

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,600
then it has a half note in it that

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:40,039
really can't work so you can't really do

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,880
P2 do show and expect something that

85
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,160
that looks right because that that just

86
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:49,520
wouldn't work but instead in terms of

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:54,360
iterating for n inp2 do recurse we'll

88
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:59,479
say notes and rests we buers that let's

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,440
print NS offset and and and we can see

90
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:04,160
that

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,160
um and we could even do measure number

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,440
ha this would totally have saved you

93
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,080
time on problems at three wouldn't have

94
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,280
um oops uh we'll go back and do call

95
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,680
these number equals one measures are

96
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
auton

97
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,880
numbered and now when we go back here we

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,919
can see the rest is in measure

99
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:31,759
one then the not e is in measure one at

100
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,759
offset one in fact let's

101
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,759
print

102
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,039
it's we should see that e's in measure

103
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,120
one at offset one is a half note and the

104
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:51,319
C is in measure two at offset one is a

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,479
coordin I'd make this longer but that's

106
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,720
basically all there is to do with ties

107
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,720
thanks fisting
