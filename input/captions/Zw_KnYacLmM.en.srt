1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,680
um thanks so much for sticking around

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,280
for the last Talk of the day I'm really

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,920
excited to have Nadia heninger here from

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,759
UC San Diego um for those of you who

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,440
don't know Nadia's work she's done some

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,439
of the most influential work in applied

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,720
crypto over the last um say 10 years in

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,240
both analysis and crypt analysis of

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,119
deployed protocols so lots of factoring

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,719
discrete log analysis of TLS um and has

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,399
had a ton of impact both in research and

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,360
in what systems are used in practice um

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,920
she's won best paper awards from all the

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,559
conferences and test of time Awards and

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,719
is also a wonderful speaker so thanks

16
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,719
for

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,800
coming so thank you so much for having

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,079
me um and it's always nice to be back in

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
Cambridge um enjoying your lovely

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,239
weather

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,559
uh um so uh this talk I heard some

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,439
grumbling about the title like how do

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,360
you pronounce that um so I uh I made up

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,479
this title it is a combination of two

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,520
words Crypt analysis and economics so

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,479
this talk is about sort of the structure

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,080
of our field and the different

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,840
incentives in play and how they

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,960
influence the kind of research that gets

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,880
done so this is a meta talk which is a

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,240
bunch of inside baseball so I apologize

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,479
to people who are a little bit outside

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,479
of the field some of this may be

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,040
intelligible and some of it may be like

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,079
too

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,439
obscure academic politics so um but this

37
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,439
this talk is going to be a mix of semi-

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,040
spicy opinions which you may or may not

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,320
um agree with and uh you can if you want

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,719
to Sidetrack me like that's cool we can

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,880
we can get totally sidetracked if you

42
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,920
want that that might be fun um so that

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
will be that will be so that that's kind

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,439
of the plan here is I will give you

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,520
semiformed semi- spicy opinions on a

46
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,759
variety of topics that I have a varying

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,240
amount of expertise on but I have

48
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,520
opinions because I've been doing this

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,239
for uh 15 years I guess um okay so

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,920
here's my madeup title with madeup word

51
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,840
um and yeah okay so crypto analysis and

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,560
economics and it's the economics in the

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,040
sense of markets um and incentives

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
rather than money strictly speaking

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,160
although money is part of it okay so the

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,239
starting point here is if we think of

57
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,760
ourselves as a research field um we have

58
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,160
some input which are essentially we get

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,200
funding from like governments and

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,680
companies and like our institutions and

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,720
the states and whatnot um and then we

62
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,239
have a bunch of human effort from

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,519
researchers professors students so on

64
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,000
and so forth and like any academic field

65
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,120
we produce outputs and generally the

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
outputs from any academic field are we

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,280
write papers and we train students who

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
then go like contribute to the workforce

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,280
and are like part of the development of

70
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,360
our civilization so that's like Academia

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,159
as a whole and then like within

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,879
cryptography as a field we have another

73
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,760
output which is a set of cryptographic

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,440
algorithms that we say these are good

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,799
algorithms that everybody should be

76
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,000
using um that we should use in this

77
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,799
protocol which is like proven secure and

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,560
and whatnot and like with these

79
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,080
parameters and like we have proven it

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,879
secure in this way and we say world go

81
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,920
out and use this do not invent your own

82
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,519
cryptography we know what you're doing

83
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,720
you don't so use this stuff so like as a

84
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,519
field we have this EXT output which is

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,680
we say like we're a science we know what

86
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,120
we're doing here's the algorithms that

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,000
you should be using so this is our sort

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,799
of like extra thing so this is our like

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,120
super simplified version of the world

90
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,599
that you know and clearly there are like

91
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
incentives and structures in play here

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,560
in what gets funded and what people

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,319
choose to work on um the other thing

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,200
that's interesting about cryptography as

95
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,040
a field of study is that not all fields

96
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,079
have such the sort of Duality that we do

97
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,079
so um cryptography security there

98
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,640
there's a constructive side and there's

99
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,360
a destructive side and one side in the

100
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,759
field of cryptography builds

101
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,880
cryptography the other side destroys it

102
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,759
that is not a typo some of you may get

103
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,400
the joke who gets the

104
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:28,759
joke some of you get the okay

105
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,520
um so yes and um you might think okay

106
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,639
like we we actually heard some very nice

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,400
talks about complexity Theory and lower

108
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,039
bounds and so you might think like um

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,360
really like the way okay so we have a

110
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,600
side that constructs cryptography and

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,880
then we have a side that like tries to

112
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,199
attack cryptography because that's

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,919
really the only way that we know how to

114
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,320
show that something is secure is like

115
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,199
people have looked at this for some

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,720
number of years and nobody has broken it

117
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,360
yet um and you might think like maybe

118
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,199
it's really only necessary to research

119
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,759
do research in Crypt analysis because

120
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,919
complexity Theory this is a failure of

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,080
complexity Theory really like if we had

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,919
strong lower bounds for certain problems

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
like we would not need all of these

124
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,600
people to try to break things because we

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,120
could just like have some concrete

126
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,440
complexity lower Bound for some

127
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,720
fundamental problem that we could then

128
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
build cryptography off of well I mean we

129
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,440
would also have to like resolve P versus

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,319
NP first in order to like do something

131
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,319
like that so it's pretty far out of

132
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,199
reach but even in in a fantasy world

133
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:28,880
where we could do that um we still need

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,680
attack work period because you have to

135
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,199
have the attacks in order to inspire the

136
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,720
security models that you want to prove

137
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,160
things to be secure in um so this is my

138
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,960
like argument for why attack work in

139
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,600
general and crypt analysis in general

140
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,479
isn't done and why like sort of we need

141
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,639
that to be a healthy side of the field

142
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:55,759
um okay and I also want to draw a sort

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,800
of analogy to um this super interesting

144
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,160
essay by Tim goers who's read this essay

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
it's like really enlightening actually

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
if you if you like math I recommend like

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
looking it up and reading it because

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,919
it's it's um it's very interesting and

149
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,800
very beautiful so so he writes this

150
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,680
essay about the two cultures of

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,479
mathematics and um many people have

152
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,120
written about this topic in various

153
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,360
formulations um but he sort of um

154
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,280
divides mathematicians into two worlds

155
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,400
one of them um like one set of of

156
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,080
mathematicians lives to solve problems

157
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,039
um and then the other sort of set of

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,160
mathematicians want to build and

159
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,599
understand theories um and I think other

160
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,280
thinkers have have called these like

161
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:44,319
frogs and Eagles for example

162
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,720
um and so um what goard does in his

163
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,319
essay is he talks about how um this way

164
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,120
of dividing up mathematicians ends up

165
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,000
influencing the the way that the field

166
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,160
regards certain subfields of of

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
mathematics so there are fields that are

168
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
largely problemsolving like

169
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,479
combinatorics um and there are fields

170
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,120
that are much more Theory building like

171
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,319
algebraic geometry and what ended up

172
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,000
happening in mathematics is that the um

173
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,080
sort of combinatorics fields was

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,319
generally result like thought of as like

175
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,160
less prestigious than algebraic geometry

176
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,639
because they were not doing all of this

177
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,280
beautiful Theory building um and that

178
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,400
that Prestige influences the kinds of

179
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,639
research that gets done and what

180
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
students study um and then I want sort

181
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,599
of if we go back to being in

182
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,120
cryptography Crypt analysis is much more

183
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:31,879
towards the problem solv in side than

184
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,199
the theory building side of our field

185
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,280
and so I think there is like a similar

186
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,759
structural issue going on there that um

187
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,240
it is somehow like less highly regarded

188
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,479
in a way and um if I make a super

189
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,840
simplistic sort of caricature of the

190
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,199
kinds of messaging that happens from the

191
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,400
different sides of the field um if you

192
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,319
listen to people who give talks about

193
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,879
sort of constructive cryptography um I

194
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,560
mean it's beautiful they're like

195
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,360
exploring the underlying truth of the

196
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,360
computational universe and they're

197
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
building like a bright future full of

198
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,440
privacy preserving technologies that

199
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,840
will allow companies to collect and

200
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,840
process all the data they want without

201
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,960
any legal liability whatsoever um and I

202
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,520
mean clearly this is like companies love

203
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,199
this stuff they are building the future

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,759
and they can and they can do whatever

205
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,240
they want because magic technology will

206
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,919
let them do it um whereas like on the

207
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,319
other side like I mean researchers are

208
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,720
just destroying perfectly good

209
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,479
cryptographic algorithms with like

210
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,680
one-off tricks and like okay like some

211
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,039
somebody screwed up their parameters

212
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,479
okay you fix the parameters and really

213
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,159
and then you like end up in this sort of

214
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,560
like cycle but like really it's just

215
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,680
like a question of parameters like

216
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,519
there's some parameters that work surely

217
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,760
um and like this is not building the

218
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,839
future this is destroying the future so

219
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,959
like why would any company want to fund

220
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,360
that like there's no reason why would

221
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,800
they do that they they want to fund the

222
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,920
future not the past and they don't want

223
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,680
to fund destruction they want to fund

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,440
things that are building the future okay

225
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,279
and um this this extends to like there

226
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,880
are certain people in the field who do

227
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,600
not think that attack work is like valid

228
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,519
science um this applies more to like

229
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,800
security than like cryp Crypt analysis

230
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,600
at least with Crypt analysis if you're

231
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,320
doing stuff that requires like a PhD in

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399
math to understand um it's hard to claim

233
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,399
that that's not like valid research uh

234
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,600
but like there's kind of this notion

235
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,000
that it's like less scientific and it's

236
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,160
less valuable um and just as like

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,640
comfort for any students who are in the

238
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,079
room um I want to provide some anecdotes

239
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,200
from when I was on the job market the

240
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:39,200
first time around as a junior Professor

241
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,880
um this

242
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,720
was uh an embarrassing long time I guess

243
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,040
this was like 13 years ago so this was

244
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,200
this was a while ago but the the kinds

245
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,480
of questions that I got there there was

246
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,839
this notion that like what we really

247
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,440
needed was like a science of security

248
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,200
and in breaking things this is not

249
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,720
scientific you're just finding bugs like

250
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,440
really we need to solve this by making a

251
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,760
science of security and then we will no

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
longer have to deal with all of these

253
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,839
bugs is that a hand yeah I was confused

254
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,839
about something go back

255
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,360
slides yeah um I'm confused why um this

256
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,079
implied that privacy preserving

257
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,519
Technologies would allow companies to

258
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,000
like help companies collect data you

259
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,000
would think that you know privacy like

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
stops them data protect privacy like us

261
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,120
it wait I can't hear all the words

262
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,720
you're saying so it's it's implied for

263
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
my understanding that it says privacy

264
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,640
preserving technologies will help

265
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,079
collect and process a lot of data right

266
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,839
like just part from like Association

267
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,200
like word association it feels like you

268
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,000
would think that privacy preserving

269
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
technology stops them from collecting

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,160
data from like you know servers people

271
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,760
so like I'm just curious what's the

272
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,040
connection why does

273
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,120
that I'm being a little bit provocative

274
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,120
here um I mean you could you could hear

275
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,839
the you can hear the you could hear the

276
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,639
Snickers when when um half the room got

277
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,519
got the the implication here so

278
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,040
basically so what the companies so the

279
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,160
reason that compan are interested in

280
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,200
something like fully homomorphic

281
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,399
encryption is because what they want is

282
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,560
to continue collecting all the data that

283
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,200
they can on their customers and then be

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,440
able to like do all the metrics that

285
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,959
they want without like having to share

286
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,680
the data across departments having to

287
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,800
share the data like to other companies

288
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,200
but also like to basically tell

289
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,839
um like whenever they get hacked that

290
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,680
they they don't need to like actually

291
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,000
report any data breaches because no

292
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,519
information was revealed because it was

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,320
all encrypted so you still want to have

294
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,880
all of the surveillance capitalism that

295
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,839
is like sort of funding the internet but

296
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,120
without any of the problems that come

297
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:46,600
from the lack of fundamental security

298
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:50,079
that we have um with computers basically

299
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,399
um yeah so like I mean we know that

300
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,560
companies they they want fully

301
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,000
homomorphic encryption because they want

302
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,160
a magic box and the magic box is going

303
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,320
to solve all of their cybercity problems

304
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,240
that is that is what they think that

305
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,240
they are going to get

306
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,120
um okay which they you know maybe maybe

307
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,399
someday they will I don't know um okay

308
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,480
so basically the the underlying thesis

309
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,920
for my talk is that um like all good

310
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,560
dualities there is no light without the

311
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,120
dark and I think that in some areas of

312
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,399
cryptography the two sides of our field

313
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,519
are out of balance and this imbalance is

314
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:30,639
leading to insecurity um I don't have

315
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,000
necessarily solution but I want to pose

316
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,920
the problem and be like you know

317
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,160
provocative here and maybe maybe

318
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,680
somebody will come up with a solution or

319
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,519
maybe I'll just encourage you to like

320
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,560
break some more stuff because it's fun

321
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,839
um so I think basically every talk that

322
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,199
I give there is some XKCD cartoon at

323
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,480
least one in it because there's always

324
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:56,560
an appropriate XKCD cartoon so um this

325
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,279
is the relevant XKCD cartoon for um this

326
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,680
talk which is basically all modern

327
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,720
structure is this amazing tower that is

328
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,160
built upon some project that some random

329
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,880
person in Nebraska has been thanklessly

330
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,480
maintaining since 2003 yeah what is the

331
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,480
left pad of

332
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,399
cryptography the the what the the left

333
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,199
pad sorry uh there ComiCon reference to

334
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,199
a job script package left pad oh um what

335
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,839
what is which does exactly what it

336
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,839
sounds like uh do

337
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,680
we so um actually I'm gonna get my water

338
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,600
for a second um this

339
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,160
is a great question yes uh you you

340
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,079
predicted exactly the structure of my

341
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,920
slides this is great um so uh i' I've

342
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,360
got a few more variants of this but um

343
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,120
sort of in line actually with the

344
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,800
previous talk which I think LED very

345
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,360
very well into like the first half of

346
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:56,560
this talk that I'm going to be giving

347
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,759
um basically uh yeah all modern digital

348
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,880
infrastructure which is that like you

349
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,480
know we we we will be relying on RSA for

350
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,000
decades to come and everything does rely

351
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,759
on decades RSA for like has been relying

352
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,959
on RSA for

353
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,759
decades the security of RSA relies very

354
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,399
closely on the fact that we believe that

355
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:21,079
classical factoring costs precisely L

356
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,560
1/3 with cube root of 64 over 9 if you

357
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,279
change either of those numbers it's a

358
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,120
bad time

359
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,079
so I'll talk about that more um Okay so

360
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,959
for this project which I started this

361
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,160
project and like with as as with all

362
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,120
good projects I was like over ambitious

363
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,800
and I I actually talked to a large

364
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,240
number of people over the past year um

365
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,040
who do either relevant things and most

366
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,839
of these people have done some kind of

367
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,240
attack work um in various areas of

368
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,680
cryptography um and this is not a

369
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,800
representative sample at all this is

370
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,240
just like who I thought of to talk to

371
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,680
and the people that I thought you know

372
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,000
would respond to my email or whatever um

373
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,759
so we had super interesting

374
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,399
conversations which I should have

375
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,440
recorded more carefully and I didn't um

376
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,600
but I have recorded sort

377
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,079
of parts of them and I have Incorporated

378
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,639
parts of the things into this talk so

379
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,040
this talk these people are not to blame

380
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,959
for anything that is in this talk but I

381
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,240
do have quotes that I attribute to them

382
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,399
and um various ideas but yeah okay the

383
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,519
you know these conversations um were

384
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,440
quite wide ranging but um among other

385
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,759
things okay um Martin alre complains

386
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,079
that you're you're asking all these

387
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,360
weird introspection questions that are

388
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,360
kind of hard to answer so it may or may

389
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,279
not have been uh you

390
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,839
know useful or coherent um and the other

391
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,759
thing that I want to say is that I live

392
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,360
in the open research World um and so one

393
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,360
of the things that um Paul CER mentioned

394
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,319
is that the balance is really different

395
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,639
in the government and classified world

396
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,000
where offense gets the Lion Share of the

397
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,560
budget and Glory um and they may have

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,759
the opposite imbalance from the academic

399
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,399
world um and

400
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,480
we have some evidence in the open world

401
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,680
that prioritizing offense over defense

402
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,959
in the government has led to problems so

403
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,319
things like um you know famously I mean

404
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,920
I I teach this every year to my students

405
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:19,079
in like intro crypto classes like the

406
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,639
story of the NSA shortening the key

407
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:24,079
strength of Dez um which caused it to

408
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:28,279
become obsolete quite a bit earlier than

409
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:33,079
it would have otherwise um and then um

410
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:34,560
we have the dual EC drbg debacle um and

411
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,279
there's continuing mistrust around

412
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,279
standardization algorithm

413
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:40,880
recommendations um that have definitely

414
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,040
influenced the like ongoing M

415
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,440
postquantum

416
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:49,160
process so okay um so I am talking about

417
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,680
incentives mostly in the open

418
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,600
cryptography research World um so now I

419
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,519
have a collection of thoughts about

420
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,199
different areas um so this also so my

421
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,120
first is quantum Computing and I want to

422
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,600
say I am not a Quantum Computing person

423
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,760
I live purely in the classical World um

424
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,079
I in fact only understand Quantum

425
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,520
Computing at like a super Cartoon Level

426
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,280
so these are like things that I have

427
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,959
like gathered but you may disagree with

428
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,799
what I'm going to say but I think the

429
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,360
last talk um before the break um

430
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,959
introduced this quite nicely which is

431
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,400
essentially that the looming threat of

432
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,280
quantum computers is just about the

433
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
biggest thing in our field in the past

434
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,760
several years and when we think about

435
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,640
Quantum comp computers we think of sh's

436
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,320
algorithm because sh's Al algorithm is

437
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,160
going to break all classical public key

438
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,480
cryptography um the thing that's

439
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,799
interesting so you go into a group of

440
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,280
cryptographers and they talk about

441
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,120
quantum computers as like Shores

442
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,520
algorithm Shores algorithm sh Shores

443
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,400
algorithm factoring disree log elliptic

444
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,320
curve discreet log or hosed um but if

445
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
you go to a talk by like the people who

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,919
are actually building quantum computers

447
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,640
they don't want to talk about Shores

448
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,280
algorithm they only talk about it as

449
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,120
like a proof of concept or like maybe

450
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,880
like some like academic demonstration

451
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,679
they do not talk about it as like the

452
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,520
killer app for Quantum Computing um what

453
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,559
they talk about is quantum chemistry

454
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,240
simulations so um they don't care about

455
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,640
sh Shores algorithm because who cares

456
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
about Shores algorithm when you can

457
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,080
solve world hunger by building better

458
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,080
fertilizer or you're going to like solve

459
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,400
Disease by doing drug Discovery or

460
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,679
you're going to like solve energy

461
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,440
Problems by like building better

462
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,880
batteries and solar cells like this is

463
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,320
this is what the people who are like if

464
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,960
you go to these talks where they're like

465
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,559
actually like we built a cubid like this

466
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,039
is what they talk about um and like if

467
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,559
you're if you're like hey so when are we

468
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,200
going to have sh Shores algorithm like

469
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,679
they avoid that question like they do

470
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,120
not want to answer it um which is like

471
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,480
this weird disconnect because like

472
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,760
crypto versus like the quantum

473
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,640
people yeah talking about incentives

474
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,640
right uh you one reason for this might

475
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,760
be that uh you know NSA or Mist just put

476
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,000
out this refective that's said 203 by

477
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,400
2035 please stop using RSA so by the

478
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,760
time we build AUM computer that could

479
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,919
Factor would be that nobody in the world

480
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,559
is using uh

481
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,559
RSA at all which decreases significantly

482
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,799
the incentive to build a computer that

483
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,559
factor in the first place people are

484
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,880
still going to be using RSA in 2035

485
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,480
people are still going to be using RSA

486
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,480
for decades after quantum computer is

487
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,799
built New Uses of uh of Photography are

488
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,720
not going to be I mean people are going

489
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,880
to start slowly shifting

490
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,960
argue about the magnitude of that shift

491
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:40,360
um but you know um you know that could

492
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:44,159
be a reason why you know there isn't

493
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,159
more but there are all these

494
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,600
archives enough so okay so there's data

495
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,360
centers in Utah full of um information

496
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,640
that is uh encrypted in yeah is that

497
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,280
information valuable when it's who knows

498
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,039
I mean that's that's a great question uh

499
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,400
so but you know if if nobody actually

500
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,840
build ever builds a computer where you

501
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,840
could use shores algorithm then like do

502
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,120
we need to transfer like you know change

503
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,240
all of our cryptography maybe we should

504
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,840
just keep using RSA choice right I mean

505
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,799
uh the government systems apparently

506
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,240
supposed to use one of these new things

507
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,559
by crane 35 so yeah so it's clear that

508
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:23,320
we will have a we will have a transition

509
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:25,640
um I uh I'll get through this this like

510
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,720
section um

511
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,679
because I think that there's like a

512
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:35,480
weird there's a little bit of a weird

513
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:37,280
disconnect um that I want to like um to

514
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,440
point out and and like maybe maybe the

515
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,440
people who know more about Quantum

516
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,159
Computing can like uh help solve this

517
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,919
disconnect um I think so one of the most

518
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,880
enlightening things that I read about

519
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,679
Quantum Computing was this this is a

520
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,720
National's report which is now getting

521
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,640
quite old it's like six years old um I

522
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,640
don't think the conclusions have changed

523
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,120
even though we have had like some

524
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,760
progress in

525
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,080
building quantum computers um so I guess

526
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,400
the most recent like sort of news making

527
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,159
progress uh progress was like the Google

528
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,960
announcement that like they think that

529
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,120
they may be able to do error correction

530
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
like nobody has actually demonstrated

531
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Quantum error correction yet but they

532
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,159
like think that they can probably do it

533
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,559
in the future um so that's like that's

534
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,159
the current state so so we're still at

535
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,880
the point where we cannot simulate a

536
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:31,720
single logical Cubit um and uh this um

537
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,720
this National's report the first couple

538
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,640
of chapters I think are like really

539
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,799
super well written um and like I found

540
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:42,200
them very enlightening um basically the

541
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,320
um the introduction is like um sort of a

542
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,919
history of the like classical

543
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,840
semiconductor industry in the 20th

544
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,880
century and talking about like how

545
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,559
transistors were were developed and

546
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,000
essentially that like the development of

547
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,000
classical computers um is the story of

548
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,840
like in order to get an expan IAL like

549
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
rate of progress in like building

550
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,720
classical computers we had this virtuous

551
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,840
cycle where the first computers were

552
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,520
like extremely useful and people bought

553
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,039
them because you needed to do that kind

554
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,919
of computation even with like room-sized

555
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,039
computers and then the companies

556
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,080
building those computers rolled all of

557
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:23,720
their um profits back into R&D and then

558
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,760
improved their computers and then we had

559
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,279
this virtuous cycle which is what led to

560
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,200
Mo's law which is what led to the

561
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,679
amazing developments in technology that

562
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,720
we have now um

563
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:39,679
and the argument made in this report is

564
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,840
that to build an entirely new

565
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,360
um computer architecture like a quantum

566
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,559
computer we need to have the scale of

567
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,840
engineering challenges is such that the

568
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,400
investment required to do all of that

569
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,600
engineering is probably beyond the scale

570
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,600
of a single government acting alone so

571
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,760
like beyond the scale of like the NSA or

572
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,279
the Chinese government um even though

573
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,679
they may be willing to put in billions

574
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,480
of dollars you actually need probably

575
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,480
need more on the order of trillions of

576
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,919
dollars like an entire economy's worth

577
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,760
of virtuous cycle in order to actually

578
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:16,640
fund that um that kind of engineering

579
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:20,240
progress and so um sort of the the like

580
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,000
conclusion is that like um it may be

581
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,279
beyond the scale of a single government

582
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,480
to like actually build like a fully

583
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,080
scalable like quantum computer you may

584
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,679
need like um a real virtuous cycle which

585
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,279
means that you need applications for

586
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:37,679
Quantum Computing um

587
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:41,640
and so that so the question is what

588
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,520
applications do we have

589
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,520
um and okay so like we we've also like

590
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,600
heard about this from from previous

591
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,960
talks So like um you know I talked to

592
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,799
Scott arenson He estimates that there's

593
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,760
billions of dollars of investment in in

594
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,360
Quantum Computing right now um and the

595
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,559
question is for

596
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,840
what because it's not Shores algorithm

597
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,799
because there's no market for Shores

598
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,200
algorithm um it's really I mean the only

599
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:09,960
people who want to run Shores algorithm

600
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,919
are the NSA and China um so like what do

601
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,400
like what do Google and IBM think that

602
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:19,000
they are investing in um and really the

603
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,159
only real application for quantum

604
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,919
computers is this quantum chemistry

605
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,120
simulation um which means that there

606
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,919
there certainly is a market for like

607
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,320
specialized scientific equipment being

608
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,399
sold to like biotech companies and and

609
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,159
whatnot um so like you know if you have

610
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:35,360
a quantum computer that's like $100,000

611
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,760
machine that can get a speed up on

612
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,559
quantum chemistry simulations there's

613
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,960
definitely a market for that but for

614
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,360
everything else we don't I mean we we

615
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,720
actually just heard a a great talk about

616
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:51,360
this we don't have like exponential time

617
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:55,000
speedups for most problems um so all the

618
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,799
stuff about like machine learning or

619
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,320
optimization like you get some

620
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,840
polinomial time speed ups but it's sort

621
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,279
of unclear whether there's actually like

622
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:08,000
a real Market or need for that um

623
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:09,279
and so I there's this weird disconnect

624
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,080
where like the only thing quantum

625
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,039
computers are good for is breaking

626
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,159
cryptography but the only people who

627
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,320
care about breaking cryptography are

628
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,480
governments um and so like just

629
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,480
realistically like for you know we can

630
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,120
do some threat modeling like for you

631
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,320
know any entity who's using cryptography

632
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,559
um if your attacker is breaking

633
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,919
cryptography they're either pirating

634
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,399
copy protected content or they're a

635
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,520
government like essentially nobody cares

636
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:40,720
nobody else cares enough to break

637
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,679
cryptography um and like this is this is

638
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,919
great news because like cryptography is

639
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,360
doing way better than the rest of

640
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,000
security where it's just a constant

641
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,559
disaster all the time um so like I mean

642
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,120
essentially like this is like you know

643
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,840
how you just have to outrun your other

644
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,480
colleagues in front of the bear like

645
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,679
then you're doing great right like um so

646
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,520
um essentially like cryptography

647
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,080
essentially makes like you know we we

648
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,440
know that real systems get compromised

649
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,679
by like fishing and social engineering

650
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,640
and not really breaking cryptography

651
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,559
most of the time um unless your

652
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,640
adversary is a government um and so like

653
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:17,720
those are somebody else's problem really

654
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,000
like cryptography we're doing great um

655
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,520
but that means that

656
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,960
like normal people don't need to run

657
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,320
Shores algorithm on their cell phones so

658
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,039
we don't need a

659
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,559
Quantum like we don't need a a Quantum

660
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,000
co-processor on every smartphone in the

661
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,559
world so what are quantum computers for

662
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,760
essentially like there's no Mass market

663
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,480
for sh Shores algorithm um the C the

664
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,600
customers for sh Shores algorithm are

665
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,000
handful of large governments the people

666
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,399
who are building quantum computers think

667
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,360
of Shores algorithm as a proof of

668
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,600
concept and not an end

669
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,679
product and so um if Shores algorithm

670
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,039
ever becomes feasible it's going to be a

671
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,520
byproduct of other things that the

672
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,880
market cares more about and so if it is

673
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,880
a b it is if it is a direct byproduct of

674
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,679
quantum chemistry simulations then we

675
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,279
may be in trouble but if you need

676
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,559
something much beyond that then I don't

677
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,799
know is it ever going to be built like

678
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,760
because the market incentives just

679
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,000
aren't

680
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,039
there so I just wanted to point out this

681
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,559
disconnect so this is my first like

682
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,480
spicy opinion on Quantum Computing which

683
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,840
is not my research area yeah there's if

684
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,360
they're going to build like invest and

685
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,919
do research and build this F for or

686
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,919
whatever reason whether it's chemical

687
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,559
simulation or whatever then they'll be

688
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,679
able to implement your's algorithm once

689
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,039
they have the technology there then it

690
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,200
will be like so if the if the cubits you

691
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:45,360
need to do quantum chemistry simulations

692
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,919
work in the same way and like the the

693
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,799
circuits that you need to build and the

694
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,440
air correction that you need to do if

695
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,519
that is all the same then yes it will

696
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,200
happen if you need if you need to

697
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:59,200
do something else

698
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,760
architecturally then it seems less

699
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,159
likely to

700
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,559
happen just heard of I'm not going to

701
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,600
attribute to one of the faulty members

702
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,440
here that uh Quantum factoring is is an

703
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,760
easier problem completely in terms of

704
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,760
building than quantum chemistry again

705
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,880
this is a blackbox statement uh I don't

706
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,640
know any details and I'm not even

707
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,760
attributing to anybody so this is

708
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,000
interesting this is the first time that

709
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,200
I've heard that factoring is easier than

710
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,760
quantum chemistry H I priv tell you that

711
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,279
okay we

712
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,399
will we will talk offline then

713
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:41,760
um yeah the uh the the statement was

714
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:44,840
that um an unknown source uh says an

715
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,039
unnamed Source um says that um factoring

716
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,039
is easier than quantum chemistry

717
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:54,399
simulation so if that's the case um I

718
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,840
guess that set that sets up an

719
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,519
interesting set of incentives so if

720
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,120
factoring goes along the way to build

721
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,799
like the $100,000 specialized like um

722
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,080
scientific equipment that you can sell

723
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:11,320
to like biotech companies

724
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,320
um if there's enough of a market to sell

725
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,440
the specialized scientific equipment to

726
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,640
like um to biotech companies Plus sell

727
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,559
your facturing machines to the NSA then

728
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,240
then like yeah maybe maybe the the

729
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,480
things are maybe maybe the incentives

730
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:30,039
are aligned so another incentive is to

731
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,039
be richer than S

732
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,840
okay so so yes uh you were you were

733
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,600
saying there's a market for stealing

734
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,600
Bitcoin and

735
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,240
[Laughter]

736
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,880
um uh so this this yeah I mean the

737
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,640
question is um is there anything that

738
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,840
could get Bitcoin to go away um

739
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,039
and I don't I don't think the security

740
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,760
claims of um cryptocurrencies are why

741
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,519
people keep in investing in

742
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,279
them

743
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:06,559
uh so so yeah

744
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,600
um I so I I don't know like whether the

745
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,880
engineering challenges can be overcome

746
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,559
in building a quantum computer I mean I

747
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,720
think none of us do right and like this

748
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,240
is also not our area because we do like

749
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,360
the cryptography and like maybe the

750
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,279
algorithm side but not the like you know

751
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,440
deep Frozen Cubit side um so but it's

752
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:27,320
yeah

753
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,720
um it is an entirely new Computing

754
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,519
architecture and we've had proposals for

755
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,200
very compelling entirely new Computing

756
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,000
architectures in the past like you talk

757
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,679
to gray beards and they'll talk about

758
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,559
like Optical Computing in the 90s and

759
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:41,679
like we don't have Optical computers now

760
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,120
even though they could do like super

761
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,640
awesome things so yeah

762
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,440
um I think I think it's just worth

763
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,120
thinking about like what good is an

764
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,039
entirely new Computing architecture for

765
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,639
um and clearly like we have some

766
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,960
applications but we don't have general

767
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:02,240
purpose Computing applications and so

768
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,799
the question is like is there a market

769
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,000
for the special purpose Computing

770
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,960
applications that they are good for um

771
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,919
that is enough to fund the engineering

772
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,440
developments the financial industry is

773
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,679
very dependent on traditional

774
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,840
cryptography if they don't change then

775
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,880
there's certainly an incentive for a

776
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:27,279
malan actor to to go after the whole

777
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,799
thing I don't think cryptography is

778
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,080
really the thing that is protecting the

779
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,480
financial industry think regulation is

780
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,240
the thing that's protecting the the

781
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,080
financial industry

782
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,720
um uh I mean you know a lot large

783
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,399
portions of the fin Finance industry are

784
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,360
still using single de from what I hear

785
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:48,039
so like

786
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,880
um I don't know so um okay actually so

787
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:54,399
if we go to um this the topic of who is

788
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,960
willing to bet on um factoring like

789
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,559
quantumly versus classically um and I

790
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,720
made this slide before I heard of any

791
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,760
bets that um that venod was was willing

792
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,120
to put money towards um so I asked my

793
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,159
various panelists their opinions of

794
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,679
whether 20 48 bit RSA would happen

795
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,399
classically or quantumly first um and

796
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,519
they were split so some people said

797
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:18,960
Quantum some people said classical um

798
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,159
Antoine J has a running bet against Dan

799
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,840
Bernstein um on this

800
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:28,720
topic Quant have

801
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:32,960
quantumly yes 24 days

802
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:36,480
um and um actually like on the topic of

803
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,760
the talk that just preceded mine um I

804
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,080
think uh it is a compelling argument um

805
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,679
this was this was raised by Tomas PTO um

806
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,639
that um you know the original Shores

807
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,080
algorithm was clearly sort of infeasible

808
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:52,080
to build with a reasonable number of

809
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,279
physical cubits um but uh perhaps we

810
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,200
will actually sort of meet in the middle

811
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:57,320
with algorithmic improvements um that

812
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,559
this is like a compelling line of

813
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,760
research yeah you have a timeline on any

814
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,799
of

815
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,440
these no so it could be so so this this

816
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,600
is this is yeah instead of saying like

817
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,480
by 2040 we're going to have like 20 40

818
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,799
40 bit RSA this is just Quantum versus

819
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,919
classical who who gets to 20 uh who gets

820
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,919
to 20 48 bits

821
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:25,480
first um and uh so this this seems like

822
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,840
a a compelling Direction essentially

823
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,559
like in order for shor's algorithm to

824
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,159
actually become feasible we really need

825
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,320
to get the the complexity down we've

826
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,480
heard this from multiple angles um so

827
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,200
that's cool

828
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,480
um so short little interlude um one

829
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,080
thing like I'm a little bit too young

830
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,480
for this but like my favorite papers are

831
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,559
like all written in the 90s cuz it was

832
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,120
like super fun then like it was like all

833
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,679
the stories that you hear of like crypto

834
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,880
like people were like proposing schemes

835
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,279
and then they get like broken in the

836
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,639
rump session and it's like um and

837
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,120
there's all these like beautiful attacks

838
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,159
that are like Elementary number Theory

839
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,360
and you're just like a this is so great

840
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,399
um and like it is not that fun anymore

841
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,399
like the papers are like so long and

842
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,159
they're like so complicated and like the

843
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,119
attack techniques are like so long and

844
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:19,159
it's so complicated like it's really

845
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,280
it's like way less fun um and uh like

846
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,520
talking to some of the people that I

847
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,399
interviewed um you know for example like

848
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,119
Paul cotcher okay he like invented side

849
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,599
Channel attacks like against

850
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,119
cryptography and basically he said that

851
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,079
like you know he started by doing

852
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:40,359
classical Crypt analysis but then that

853
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,720
got too hard and so like when the actual

854
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,240
like classical crypto analysis like when

855
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,720
people improved their implementation so

856
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,359
much that you couldn't just like break

857
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,359
them out right you needed stronger

858
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,040
attack techniques so you needed a better

859
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,520
attack technique invent side Channel

860
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,480
attacks turns out that like nobody can

861
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,880
protect against side Channel attacks um

862
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:03,359
so uh that's kind of um um like One

863
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,880
Direction um yeah Emanuel to had like um

864
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,280
sort of points out that there's been

865
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,079
this shifting balance so like there used

866
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,320
to be a lot more Crypt analysis papers

867
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:16,040
25 or 30 years ago um and we see like

868
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:18,480
you know um far fewer now um and some of

869
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,800
that so antoan J um says like with

870
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
provable security people are making

871
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,640
fewer and fewer stupid mistakes the

872
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,880
kinds of things that made Crypt analysis

873
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,839
possible without breaking the algorithms

874
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,079
um sometimes there are things left over

875
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,000
but it's really getting harder to get

876
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,520
interesting resultss so in some sense

877
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,839
this is good news for the constructive

878
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,480
side that there are better tools there

879
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:38,960
are better proof techniques there's

880
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,160
better analysis um so you can publish

881
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,760
papers without making like super

882
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,200
embarrassing mistakes but this also

883
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,839
means there's fewer targets for upand

884
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,079
cominging researchers to like you know

885
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,920
sharpen their teeth on

886
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,240
essentially um

887
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,280
and if you want to have like a pipeline

888
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,280
of people who know how to do Crypt

889
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,440
analysis they have to publish papers on

890
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,560
something so the question is what like

891
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,520
are we training the next generation of

892
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:14,040
of um like Crypt analysis researchers

893
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,800
and um kind of I mean clearly we still

894
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,240
are because there are still like you

895
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,119
know young people who are working on the

896
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,920
on these kinds of things so like Tomas

897
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,880
PTO you know he got his PhD a few years

898
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,680
ago so I guess is like fairly young um

899
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,640
and like his philosophy towards breaking

900
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,920
lattice schemes is there's like three

901
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,040
things that you can do you can look at

902
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,680
the scheme and you can get like an

903
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,440
incremental algorithmic Improvement on

904
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,800
some fundamental hard problem like lwe

905
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,920
or whatever um you can look at the crazy

906
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,400
new assumptions that people have to come

907
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,040
up with because if you actually want to

908
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,079
build like fully homomorphic encryption

909
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,119
or like zero knowledge proofs or

910
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,040
whatever like you need some like some

911
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,640
special variant of like ring LW you

912
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,359
can't just use like the the main scheme

913
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,400
and so like those variants are more

914
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,160
subject to attack but like if you can't

915
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,880
break that then you just do a side

916
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,720
Channel and you know that the side

917
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,720
channel is going to work so like that's

918
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,680
how you publish the paper and um that's

919
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,640
why there's so many side Channel papers

920
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,880
right but this means that like people in

921
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,480
the popular press think that side

922
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,920
channels are an actual real

923
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,599
problem even though

924
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,400
like it's a super strong like threat

925
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,920
model that like your adversary is

926
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,760
running a process like collocated on the

927
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,160
same processor as yours um so like this

928
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,920
is one of these weird incentive things

929
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,839
that like people have to publish papers

930
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,599
somehow people are not publishing nearly

931
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,920
as many papers on like social

932
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,359
engineering techniques even though we

933
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,000
know like that's actually how companies

934
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,160
get hacked and not side Channel attacks

935
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,760
but then the companies are like oh we

936
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,880
really have to fix this like whatever

937
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,960
this new like meltdown variant that is

938
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,200
coming out so that's like a weird thing

939
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,480
that's coming out like the imbalances in

940
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,079
our field that we have to keep

941
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,319
publishing papers mean that companies

942
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,800
are focusing on the wrong things in a

943
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:06,800
weird way um so from a paper publishing

944
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,200
perspective like if you're a student

945
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
here's one way to think about like how

946
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,760
to look at a solve a problem is like you

947
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,599
have some Target problem you want to

948
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,359
solve you have a collection of attack

949
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,720
techniques and you iterate through your

950
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,400
collection of attack techniques and you

951
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,560
try to just whack your problem with with

952
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,400
each of them and see if you get a hit so

953
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,240
that's one way to to do something yeah

954
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,119
is it actually true that the companies

955
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,200
are focusing on these things that people

956
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,800
publish

957
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,359
or they know better I think a lot of

958
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,800
companies are freaking out about like

959
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,839
patching against like the most latest

960
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,440
like side Channel

961
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:42,119
attack but that's also easier to catch

962
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,800
against that than to prevent social

963
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,119
engineering attacks yes so I mean there

964
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,079
there may be an effect of like you do

965
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,680
what you can and certainly you will look

966
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,880
irresponsible if like somebody if you

967
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,079
like don't patch against a thing that

968
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,920
somebody told you were vulnerable

969
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,440
against but like maybe that's not the

970
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,440
best use of time

971
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,480
so was there a hint you since we're

972
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,960
saying Pap like things you know like

973
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,079
side tax like and the companies are like

974
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,319
looking at them getting worried can you

975
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,440
just at the end say you know don't

976
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:20,720
worry that not is that not nobody will

977
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,359
yeah I mean if you if you don't say your

978
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,720
paper is like the most important thing

979
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:27,680
to happen like the reviewers are

980
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,680
definitely not going to accept it

981
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,720
your University is going to be much

982
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,920
happier if you got a lot of press about

983
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,520
your article um and the Press they have

984
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,079
to say that it's like the newest and

985
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,560
greatest attack because like that's why

986
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,839
it's novel so there's a whole there's

987
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,240
whole layers of incentives here where

988
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:48,560
like we know the game that we're playing

989
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,800
but not everybody else knows the game

990
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,800
that we're

991
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:01,200
playing um

992
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,640
I have thought about how to write the

993
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,079
paper of like is anybody actually

994
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:10,839
exploiting a side Channel attack

995
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:14,560
ever um it's a good title is anybody

996
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:17,520
exploting a side Channel attack so

997
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,960
um I have I have asked around if anybody

998
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,000
has ever seen exploitation of a side

999
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:27,720
Channel attack um

1000
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,440
and there okay so the um and and people

1001
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,160
people are always like yeah we saw some

1002
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,680
like CCC talk from like whenever where

1003
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,480
somebody did a side Channel attack um so

1004
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,000
I have seen so there was

1005
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:44,079
one super fun

1006
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,160
paper like a couple years

1007
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,000
ago what was the name of the scheme it

1008
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,319
was it was like a broken

1009
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,599
European um

1010
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,680
proprietary uh encryption scheme where

1011
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:00,200
in order to reverse engineer the scheme

1012
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,800
they had to do a blind AES cachee attack

1013
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,319
um against the encrypted firmware that

1014
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,880
they were trying to break so that is

1015
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,119
clearly a case where like those kinds of

1016
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,240
vulnerability researchers like it turns

1017
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,319
out that like doing a an ases cach

1018
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,560
attack can actually be the way that you

1019
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,720
you get your keys in order to like

1020
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,680
decrypt the firmware that you're trying

1021
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,319
to reverse engineer so that is that is a

1022
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,720
a side Channel attack threat model that

1023
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,160
I will absolutely accept that like you

1024
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,599
have the hardware you can you can do all

1025
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,319
the side channels you want um also like

1026
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,640
apparently the like people stealing payv

1027
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,160
and stuff were were totally like doing

1028
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,839
side Channel attacks to to steal um the

1029
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,760
um whatever the encryption key of the

1030
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:43,079
day was um so like that kind of threat

1031
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,920
model where like the attacker has like

1032
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,160
unlimited physical access to like a

1033
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,720
machine that is like doing encryption

1034
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,200
that's definitely like a real side

1035
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,680
Channel model but then the the case of

1036
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,960
like General software the most that I've

1037
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,599
heard is that apparently like the

1038
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,319
Spectre and meltdown code code was

1039
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,560
included in like metlo or like some some

1040
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,480
like version of that that appeared in

1041
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,200
some malware um but I've never heard of

1042
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,160
like a

1043
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,480
real Attack of that

1044
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,280
form ipes are stolen it's like one of

1045
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,440
the ways to steal technology is to do an

1046
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,880
attack on the the Cryptor which loads

1047
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,960
the software onto the

1048
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:27,839
fpga uh so that's a practical one uh and

1049
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,760
there are some other government

1050
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,319
sectors where they probably do this type

1051
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,680
of thing but they're not going to

1052
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:39,040
publish it yeah I I I I believe that so

1053
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,040
um yeah that's that's another that's

1054
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,920
another example of of like in order to

1055
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,400
do yeah reverse engineering or other

1056
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,920
kinds of stealing like you actually have

1057
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,680
like an encrypted Target and you have

1058
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,400
like physical access to it and um and a

1059
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,240
side Channel attack is actually the the

1060
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,839
right thing to do point

1061
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,839
it's when these attacks happen

1062
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,800
that's that's that's one of the

1063
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,280
difficulties in in like writing this

1064
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,079
paper is like how do you prove that

1065
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,520
something was or was not a side Channel

1066
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,680
attack um so yeah I I don't know how to

1067
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,920
like it could be that I'm totally wrong

1068
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,359
and people are exploiting them all over

1069
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,400
the place but usually it's not the

1070
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,359
easiest way to to get

1071
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,119
data um okay um for the students I want

1072
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,960
to say there's another approach to

1073
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,960
solving problems that you can adopt

1074
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:29,839
which is um this is an anecdote about

1075
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:33,359
Fineman from this um fun uh talk SL

1076
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,720
essay um from uh Roa 10 lessons I wish

1077
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,599
i' had been taught so he he tells this

1078
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,839
anecdote about Fineman um he was fond of

1079
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,160
giving the following advice on how to be

1080
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,280
a genius you keep a dozen of your

1081
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,520
favorite problems in constantly in your

1082
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
mind and every time you hear read a new

1083
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,200
trick or new result test against your 12

1084
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,200
problems and see whether it helps every

1085
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,359
once in a while thebody hit people say

1086
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,760
how did he do it he must be a genius so

1087
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,880
this is like the opposite direction

1088
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,280
where you like um have some dictionary

1089
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,079
of Target problems and then every time

1090
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,760
you learn a new technique you like whack

1091
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,040
all of your target problems with it and

1092
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,040
every once in a while you get a you get

1093
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,720
a technique um I think I accidentally

1094
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,640
ended up doing this except it turned

1095
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,720
down to like I would read some like

1096
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,800
paper from the 90s and then like scan

1097
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,359
the internet and find somebody who

1098
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,390
screwed it up and publish a paper that's

1099
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,119
how I got a job

1100
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,640
[Music]

1101
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,640
um okay um anyway that's how I got

1102
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,160
interested in this stuff um so I want to

1103
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,319
tell you about classical and factoring

1104
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,079
and discret log a little bit so yes

1105
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:33,160
people still use RSA and Diffy Helman

1106
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:37,760
like um mod primes and they will be for

1107
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:40,680
a long time and basically okay so uh if

1108
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,040
we look at the data going across ucsd's

1109
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,640
Network um right now about 22% of SSH

1110
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:50,680
connections use RSA host Keys um 83% of

1111
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,520
TLS 1.2 connections use RSA signatures

1112
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,079
um we can't see the signatures in TLS

1113
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:58,480
1.3 because they're encrypted good job

1114
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:01,200
TLS 1.3 um but uh

1115
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,599
certificates are like basically this is

1116
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,839
the fraction of certificates that are

1117
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,839
using RSA public keys so there their

1118
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,480
signatures are going to be RSA like no

1119
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:14,319
matter whether you're using TS 1.2 or

1120
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,319
1.3 um and TS 1.3 also everybody is is

1121
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,960
only using elliptic curve Diffy Helman

1122
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:21,640
but um the protocol itself supports a

1123
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,520
list of named finite field Diffy Helman

1124
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,480
groups that are like specified

1125
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,960
hard-coded smallest size is 20 48 bits

1126
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,280
so like these are there um

1127
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,760
and most implementers are skeptical

1128
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,240
enough about the postquantum schemes

1129
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,640
that they are going to be doing hybrid

1130
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,440
so we actually are going to still be

1131
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,240
seeing these schemes for a long

1132
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:50,119
time okay so going back to our um

1133
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,720
cartoon here um all modern digital

1134
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,079
infrastructure if you look at who's

1135
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,520
actually studying this problem it's five

1136
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,800
underpaid French

1137
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,000
researchers that's it okay so um we have

1138
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,920
heard that uh factoring and discrete log

1139
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,599
are well understood and well studied

1140
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,440
problems the best algorithm that we have

1141
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:08,960
for these is called the number field Civ

1142
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,400
there is a spooky connection between

1143
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,800
factoring and finite field discreet log

1144
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,680
um that the they're like analogous

1145
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:20,760
algorithms for like both in in many

1146
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:22,160
cases um so number field Civ um this is

1147
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,680
like a picture of the structure of this

1148
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,240
algorithm it's a super complicated

1149
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,559
algorithm with a billion different

1150
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,160
parameters that you have to optimize

1151
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,119
just right in order to get it to work at

1152
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,359
all um if you optimize everything

1153
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:37,240
correctly ASM totically your running

1154
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:40,800
time is this like ugly looking function

1155
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:44,040
like L of 1/3 there's a parameter n

1156
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,079
which is either the modulus or like your

1157
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,079
Prime that you're doing discret log mod

1158
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,359
um and then you have this uh constant

1159
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,400
which is in the exponent which is like

1160
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:54,880
cube root of 64 over 9 um and so this L

1161
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,599
function comes up whenever you need to

1162
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,079
do heuristics involving the prime number

1163
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:00,480
theor to like get bounds on the

1164
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,440
smoothness of like random numbers of a

1165
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,920
particular size so basically it's like

1166
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,200
exponential in like log n the 1/3

1167
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,559
there's this ugly constant in the front

1168
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,280
which is in the exponent so it really

1169
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,480
matters and then there's this log log n

1170
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,119
to the 2/3 so like basically the running

1171
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,800
times of all of these algorithms have

1172
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:17,440
this

1173
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,119
structure um all right and then if you

1174
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,119
look at like concrete progress uh this

1175
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:24,720
is essentially what factoring discret

1176
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:27,040
log algorithm progress looks like um

1177
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,200
over the past few decades you you can

1178
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,319
see there was like constant progress and

1179
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,079
then people kind I don't know sort of

1180
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:34,720
petered out um but like factoring is

1181
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,480
like a little bit it's like a constant

1182
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,520
Factor harder than discret log turns out

1183
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:44,000
for like it's hidden by the astics but

1184
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:47,040
um it's slightly harder apparently um

1185
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,440
and the way that these records work um I

1186
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,559
think Arian ler was involved in like

1187
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,079
most of the ones down

1188
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,960
here um and then but like the way it

1189
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,559
works is like every few years some

1190
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,280
academics are like hey do we do another

1191
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,880
factoring record and everybody like

1192
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,319
pulls out their like supercomputer

1193
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,000
access or their own custers and then

1194
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:06,559
they like you know run the software for

1195
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,119
a little while like transfer some files

1196
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,240
over and then like publish a paper

1197
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:13,160
that's basically like a trip report of

1198
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,960
like here's what we did and like doing

1199
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,559
doing this kind of computation honestly

1200
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,000
is kind of a drag like so okay I I had

1201
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:23,000
like a small part in in like that little

1202
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,480
um most recent bubble which basically

1203
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,400
consisted of like babysitting a

1204
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,280
computation like part of the computation

1205
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,079
on on my cluster um and like you have to

1206
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,680
deal with like file system stuff and

1207
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:36,960
like you get like Corruptions and then

1208
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,359
like you know we have like some ungodly

1209
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,960
like SSH Tunnel open to France and it

1210
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,359
like you know the stuff just like goes

1211
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:49,040
down and like um like maintaining

1212
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:52,720
Hardware is like a giant drag um so it's

1213
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,319
yeah it's just kind of painful to do um

1214
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,960
and so it's really like a a collection

1215
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,720
of like funky little academics most them

1216
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,359
in France who actually do this stuff so

1217
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,280
if you actually want to compute like

1218
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,440
factorizations of integers the software

1219
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,760
that you're going to use is called K NFS

1220
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:11,119
um it is written by this team in inria

1221
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,559
um they credit many people but like

1222
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,079
there's varying I mean there's varying

1223
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,440
amounts of of contribution or whatnot um

1224
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,720
but like this is this is the software

1225
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:23,000
you want to use

1226
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:27,880
um and um there have actually been

1227
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,720
improvements in uh this area um by

1228
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:33,040
recent I mean I guess this past couple

1229
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:35,200
of decades um so the running time as we

1230
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,319
heard of the the general number field C

1231
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,319
um is this uh ugly function here which

1232
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:44,400
has been the same since like 1993 or

1233
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:46,359
1991 whatever um and but there actually

1234
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,920
have been improvements so for discret

1235
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:50,839
log the Final Phase of discret log there

1236
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,960
was an ASM totic Improvement that

1237
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:56,799
improved the constant in this exponent

1238
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,640
from cube root of 64 over 9 to basically

1239
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:59,920
Like This

1240
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,440
1.2 um and this makes a huge difference

1241
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,240
this is the difference between for

1242
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:09,680
like

1243
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:11,960
um 512 to 1024 bit numbers like this is

1244
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,280
like years of computation this this is

1245
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,960
like years of computation to like

1246
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:20,040
minutes of computation um and um more

1247
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,079
spectacularly in 2013 there was a series

1248
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:26,920
of improvements um that brought the

1249
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:30,680
running time for discret log in a fin

1250
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,359
field of small characteristic from this

1251
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,160
subexponential running time like L of

1252
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:38,880
1/3 to quasi polinomial so like

1253
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:41,160
basically end to the like o of login um

1254
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,960
and this freaked a bunch of people out

1255
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,760
but there was no sort of obvious

1256
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,119
extension to large characteristic finite

1257
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,520
field which is what we actually use for

1258
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,680
cryptography or to factoring so like

1259
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:54,200
that sort of petered out um but I want

1260
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:56,680
to say like even if you had a tiny

1261
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,440
looking Improvement in the running time

1262
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,920
so like if you could improve this cube

1263
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,799
root of 64 over9 to cube root of 32

1264
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,079
over9 so this is the running time of the

1265
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:08,319
special number what's called the special

1266
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:11,280
number field cve um this is academically

1267
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:13,920
easy for 1024 bit factoring this like

1268
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,160
this was done 15 years ago um by

1269
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,400
academics um if you had if you improved

1270
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,440
this 1/3 to a 1/4 this would take out

1271
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,280
2048 bits so if you think that 2048 bit

1272
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,960
RSA is is not going to be done anytime

1273
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,720
soon you are putting a bet that this 1/3

1274
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,440
can never be improv to

1275
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:32,720
1/4 um which this is an ugly looking

1276
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,839
running time like do you really think

1277
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,480
that's the running time for such a

1278
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:39,000
fundamental sounding problem is

1279
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,400
factoring like how willing are you to

1280
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,400
bet on

1281
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:48,640
this yeah some well why is it I mean

1282
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:52,760
who's working on it 500 PA French

1283
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,119
people um okay uh so just back at the

1284
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,000
envelope it's like why has nobody done

1285
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,280
1024-bit RSA um the answer is because

1286
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,240
like I mean somebody could have like

1287
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,880
clearly this was done by the NSA like 15

1288
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,559
years ago like if they didn't do it like

1289
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,400
what are tax dollars for this

1290
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,799
is this is like without any algorithmic

1291
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:14,520
improvements and this is running on CPUs

1292
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:16,520
so like you know um call up sheny and

1293
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,000
like build some like special purpose

1294
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,160
hardware and then like you know you

1295
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,480
bring this down by a factor of 100 and

1296
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:27,280
like your golden basically

1297
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,720
um so like yeah it's it's clearly

1298
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,440
feasible it's just that like this is a

1299
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,559
pain for academics so like we're talking

1300
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,319
about doing it you know we'll probably

1301
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,240
do it soon I don't know um but like okay

1302
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,880
why hasn't there been any Improvement um

1303
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,319
and the the thing is nobody's working on

1304
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,440
this problem so as I said it's five

1305
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,040
underpaid French people they're like in

1306
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,160
non and then if you want to count antoan

1307
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:51,079
J he's in like Zar broken now um but

1308
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,640
like basically one of the things that

1309
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:55,240
happened with like provable cryptography

1310
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,839
is that we had this separation between

1311
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,440
constructions and crypt analysis and

1312
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,960
people focused a lot more on the

1313
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,000
constructions um and they were insulated

1314
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,599
from the actual mathematical structure

1315
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,760
of the problems that they were working

1316
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:10,520
on which meant that like they just said

1317
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,960
assumption factoring is hard we're done

1318
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,640
and we don't need to learn all of this

1319
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,680
like complicated math that's involved in

1320
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,480
the number field Civ and so you don't

1321
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,880
have a pipeline of students who

1322
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,240
understand these things nobody studies

1323
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:26,119
this in the US um and so the work has

1324
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,000
like sort of gone elsewhere um so like

1325
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,119
literally really nobody is sort of

1326
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,480
thinking about this within France it's

1327
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:36,559
kind of an interesting structure that um

1328
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:40,040
the structure of inria as like a

1329
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,760
scientific lab they actually like the um

1330
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,599
researchers are actually supported like

1331
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,440
doing software development is part of

1332
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,880
their job and so they can be like oh I

1333
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,400
only published like one paper this year

1334
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,920
but I like built this software package

1335
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,760
and so like they get evaluated on that

1336
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,960
this is not something that you can do in

1337
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,920
the US as a professor like you have to

1338
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,640
like pump out papers you can't be like

1339
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,160
oh I publish the software package um but

1340
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,559
sort of more fundamentally like one of

1341
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,160
the reasons I think nobody's working on

1342
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,880
this is like within computer science

1343
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,400
this is not a good topic for grad

1344
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,559
students to work on because you're not

1345
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,040
going to get a job the jobs are if you

1346
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,640
study cryptography you're going to go

1347
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,839
work for a company who wants to build

1348
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,000
fhe or like wants somebody to help them

1349
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,400
with their postquantum transition

1350
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,240
studying something like the number field

1351
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,160
Civ is not going to get you a job and so

1352
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,000
like I can't in good faith like

1353
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,520
recommend grad students work on this

1354
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
topic which means that nobody except

1355
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,200
these five underpaid French people is

1356
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,440
working on it everybody's like oh

1357
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,280
factoring is a super well-studied

1358
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,280
problem but really the people who were

1359
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,920
studying it in the early 90s they're all

1360
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:49,040
retiring and there isn't another

1361
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:51,119
Generation Um so I think yeah that's

1362
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,000
that's like one of the structural issues

1363
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,839
um so if you compare the like billions

1364
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,760
of dollars a year being put into Quantum

1365
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:01,280
Computing to the current investment in

1366
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,440
the kinds of research that would lead to

1367
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,119
factoring discret log improvements

1368
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,440
classically it's at most hundreds of

1369
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,040
thousands of dollars a year to like fund

1370
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,520
like a team of a handful of French

1371
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:15,200
researchers and like a few grad students

1372
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:18,119
um so that's where the incentives are

1373
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,520
not aligned um and so like if you know

1374
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:21,640
if you talk to the people who actually

1375
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,000
understand this topic like Emanuel to is

1376
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,880
willing to put out there that he thinks

1377
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,200
the correct running time for factoring

1378
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,480
in discret log is quasi polom

1379
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,400
but we don't know how to do it like

1380
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,000
obviously if they knew how to do it like

1381
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,319
you would do it um so like you could you

1382
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,640
could like get some increased investment

1383
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,160
but it's unclear what the payoff would

1384
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,359
be because maybe the technology to do it

1385
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,160
doesn't exist I don't know like we can't

1386
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:46,520
actually say that we're going to to have

1387
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,280
it so Emanuel says that like if there

1388
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,640
was more investment like um in the field

1389
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,280
maybe you could have found the small

1390
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,359
characteristics ofet log improvements

1391
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,640
like 5 to 10 years earlier so possibly

1392
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,160
something like that is true for

1393
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,680
factoring but maybe maybe it's just

1394
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,880
maybe actually that is the running time

1395
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,280
we don't actually

1396
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,520
know

1397
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,680
yeah the number of sa and the quadratic

1398
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,640
and so forth came up uh it was

1399
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,400
congressman's algorithm which only

1400
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:17,000
worked for small characteristics and uh

1401
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:21,799
right and got the right time so so to

1402
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,799
the extent that history is uh

1403
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,119
repeats so I mean there could be a real

1404
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:31,039
difference between small characteristic

1405
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:32,880
and large characteristic discret log um

1406
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,400
because yeah I mean there

1407
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,760
were there were like structural there

1408
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,960
are structural things that you can do in

1409
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,720
small characteristic that you just

1410
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,280
cannot do um in large characteristic

1411
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:50,079
so yeah might

1412
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:53,160
be um what about the problem and Cur I

1413
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,960
have a little bit about that later yeah

1414
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,839
yeah a couple yeah okay I will I can

1415
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,880
speed up um

1416
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:01,000
maybe I will I'll speed through the

1417
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,720
isogeny part but like you know we had we

1418
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,240
had this amazing spectacular break on um

1419
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:11,000
on psych um and like uh but the isogeny

1420
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,640
people are like don't worry the field is

1421
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,839
healthy we're super happy um and the

1422
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,480
thing is like right now it's the same

1423
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:24,160
people doing constructive cryptography

1424
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:25,839
and crypt analysis in isogenes um and um

1425
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,480
the there's like a feedback loop between

1426
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,880
the constructions and the Crypt analysis

1427
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,720
that is actually much healthier than in

1428
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,839
other areas um which this was just

1429
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,119
posted the other day and it's amazing

1430
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,640
like this pre-print was posted and then

1431
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,240
it was broken the next day so this is

1432
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,000
like going back to the 90s so if you

1433
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,799
want an exciting area um isogenes the

1434
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,119
the isogeny club people are like

1435
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:50,160
deliriously happy um and so they're like

1436
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,200
don't worry higher dimensional isogenes

1437
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,280
are great um so we're going to build

1438
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:58,039
everything the spicy thing that I want

1439
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:01,359
to say that um was brought up by

1440
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:04,559
um castri and J crew who I talked about

1441
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:07,119
um uh or talked to um is that if you

1442
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:11,079
look at elliptic curve discreet log

1443
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,599
versus factoring um the people are

1444
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:14,240
worried about elliptic curve discreet

1445
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,640
log from a Quantum perspective because

1446
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,599
our key sizes are so so much smaller for

1447
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,839
elliptic curves than for factoring

1448
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:23,880
um but there's another thing which is

1449
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:25,079
going on which is sort of this

1450
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,640
dictionary between number Theory and

1451
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,640
algebraic geometry

1452
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,240
um which exists like sort of all the way

1453
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:34,640
through mathematics which is that um

1454
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,400
there's a lot of problems on the number

1455
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,400
theory side that are hard so problems

1456
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,760
over the integers are hard for some

1457
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,520
reason so like factoring integers is

1458
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,119
hard like SVP over an integer lattice is

1459
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,799
hard um the reman hypothesis is pretty

1460
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:51,799
hard to resolve if you look at the

1461
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:55,799
analogous problems in like the function

1462
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:58,880
field World um everything is easier over

1463
00:58:55,799 --> 00:59:02,520
po nomials and their extensions so like

1464
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,839
factoring pols is easy um solving SVP is

1465
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,200
easy over a lattice of polinomial in any

1466
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:09,000
lattice with like a non- archimedian

1467
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:11,119
norm um like the analog of the reman

1468
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,119
hypothesis was resolved quite some time

1469
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:17,039
ago for function

1470
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:21,039
fields and so elliptic curve discreet

1471
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:24,559
log lives on this side of this

1472
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:26,160
table and so like from the mathematical

1473
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,960
perspective and this is way beyond my

1474
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,240
math knowledge um the elliptic curve

1475
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,000
disre log problem has a lot more

1476
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,359
structure than factoring it's an isogen

1477
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,680
finding problem and as we've seen there

1478
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:38,839
um improvements that have been made in

1479
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,200
isogenies um the existing isogeny

1480
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:42,839
attacks fail because the degree of the

1481
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,400
isog is is secret but in general what

1482
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:46,440
was pointed out is sort of the geometry

1483
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,640
of elliptic curves is easier over finite

1484
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,839
Fields some people will argue like maybe

1485
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,559
like elliptic curve groups are the

1486
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,160
closest to like abstract groups that we

1487
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:58,960
could get but this is Food For Thought

1488
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:02,160
if you like um sort of academic uh

1489
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,359
conspiracy theories so I think I am over

1490
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:08,640
time so I

1491
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:10,880
will maybe skip to the end yeah there's

1492
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,240
this perhaps academic question of you

1493
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,480
know can can you find any way in which

1494
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:19,079
elliptic CS behave differently from a

1495
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,160
generic tic groups behave differently

1496
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,559
from a generic that could be like a

1497
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,200
contrived problem that can show as hard

1498
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:28,640
in the generic one would you have an

1499
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:30,319
attack have such an example right to the

1500
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,319
best of my

1501
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:33,400
knowledge is there any that's for super

1502
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,559
singular

1503
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,799
curves okay so is there any way in which

1504
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:39,880
elliptic curv groups behave differently

1505
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:41,720
from from generic

1506
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,720
groups

1507
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,680
do I guess if you Ru out all the attack

1508
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,319
on special cases no no no no that's one

1509
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,839
time one but there's there's there's

1510
01:00:49,319 --> 01:00:51,920
other okay so yeah you could you could

1511
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:53,920
take okay you could take the entire

1512
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,839
space of elliptic curves and and carve

1513
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,160
it up into classes of curves for which

1514
01:00:56,839 --> 01:01:00,400
you have attacks or behaviors and the

1515
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,480
curves that we are using for

1516
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,599
cryptography have basically been chosen

1517
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,119
so that like none of those

1518
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,920
characteristics apply and so then okay

1519
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:09,359
we don't know but like yeah I guess yeah

1520
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,880
to your point we do have cases of

1521
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,880
elliptic curves that behave differently

1522
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,880
but those curves have sort of a hard

1523
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,000
potentially diff helment problem right

1524
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,440
I'm saying make up your own G to the

1525
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,559
powers of some X and then something

1526
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:25,480
something something can you come up with

1527
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,400
a contr problem which is harder the

1528
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,000
generic group work than for these curves

1529
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,280
that are used in

1530
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,839
practice perhaps an academic question

1531
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:37,160
but would to give some incited to why

1532
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:39,160
these guys behave differently from a

1533
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,599
generic group right that would be yeah

1534
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,640
that's that's an interesting question I

1535
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,119
don't know if anybody has done that

1536
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,680
there was a little bit of an argument I

1537
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:48,880
guess I sped by it the the riddle

1538
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,160
wrapped in an enigma um article by um

1539
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,079
coas and menzes um sort of talking about

1540
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,079
like you know is it possible that the

1541
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:57,520
NSA has back doored the um elliptic

1542
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:58,640
curve standards um they have sort of an

1543
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,720
argument maybe it's a little bit

1544
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,799
different in flavor than what you're um

1545
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,039
suggesting that like um if you wanted to

1546
01:02:03,799 --> 01:02:06,319
essentially back to our family of

1547
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,960
elliptic curves like how would you

1548
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,200
generate it such that like there is like

1549
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,559
a dense enough set that you would be

1550
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,480
able to find one um and sort of they

1551
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:18,039
they they argue that it seems unlikely

1552
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:20,319
that that would have been possible um so

1553
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:24,000
uh but yeah I don't know anyway um I

1554
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:25,599
think I'm over time so I will I will um

1555
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,319
wrap up here and then I guess yeah

1556
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,319
there's stuff that I sped through that

1557
01:02:27,319 --> 01:02:30,559
didn't talk about but essentially like I

1558
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:32,520
think that there's an imbalance in

1559
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,960
incentives um between constructive

1560
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:38,920
cryptography and crypt analysis that

1561
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:41,920
leads to late surprises um and

1562
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,119
um I sped through the lat stuff uh but

1563
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,520
if you're a student lattice assumptions

1564
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:49,000
great project um and a focus but a focus

1565
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,799
on constructions is probably best if you

1566
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,480
want to actually be employed um and

1567
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:56,000
there is a serious lack of number

1568
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,799
theorists in cryptography in in the

1569
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,160
United States um for various structural

1570
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:05,000
reasons and um I think that we do not

1571
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,359
have the end of the story for classical

1572
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,559
factoring discreet log and elliptic

1573
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:10,279
curve discreet log but there is a real

1574
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,160
incentive gap for research we need to

1575
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:14,920
have a healthier um population of like

1576
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,920
real number theorists and I'm not a real

1577
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,440
number theorist uh working on this stuff

1578
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,559
and this is not also not a good project

1579
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,160
for grad students um although perhaps if

1580
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:24,720
you work with venod he can come up with

1581
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,880
like a compelling story that may help

1582
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:29,720
like make make progress I don't know but

1583
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,950
anyway so that is my shortened version

1584
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:41,250
of of spicy opinion so thank you very

1585
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:41,250
[Applause]

1586
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,480
much yeah um maybe another spicy

1587
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,279
question but I'm wondering like I think

1588
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,480
there a lot of things in the world that

1589
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:55,880
are very productive that we have decided

1590
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,960
are not meant in the academy and do

1591
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,400
think like is this something that's like

1592
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,240
just a public good and the government

1593
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,799
just fund separately like there should

1594
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,520
be like this should have like an

1595
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,839
analysis section and this is not really

1596
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:08,839
a good pit for research or is this

1597
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:09,920
actually a good pit for research we like

1598
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:12,720
restructure

1599
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:15,039
incentives um I mean I think it is it is

1600
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,240
a good uh it is a good idea to call

1601
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,920
crypto analysis like a public good um

1602
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:21,240
that should be sort of funded like

1603
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,119
separately from like the market or like

1604
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,799
we shouldn't rely on Commercial

1605
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:27,720
incentives to to fund this kind of thing

1606
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:29,400
I guess um the US government's approach

1607
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,559
for a very long time was that like this

1608
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,640
is the job of the NSA and so like they

1609
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,240
do fund large numbers of like very very

1610
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,000
good mathematicians to think about these

1611
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,200
problems all day and not all night um

1612
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,920
but then they wouldn't tell the rest of

1613
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,599
us about it I mean like the the

1614
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,039
relationship between nist and the NSA

1615
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:45,480
was supposed to be that like nist would

1616
01:04:44,039 --> 01:04:46,960
be like hey and the NSA would be like

1617
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,559
don't do this or this or this and then

1618
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,680
like they would go back but now we no

1619
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,960
longer trust the NSA to like be truthful

1620
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,400
in doing that so there is an argument to

1621
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,440
to be said that like yeah maybe we

1622
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,720
should have like a public

1623
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:05,760
um like a more public

1624
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:07,160
facing um research group uh who does

1625
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,680
that kind of thing and like we do have

1626
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,880
National Labs um but you know

1627
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,279
cryptography tends to be like a very

1628
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,520
high clearance level and so stuff

1629
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:19,880
doesn't like come out of like out of

1630
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,200
that direction um so this is one way

1631
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,520
where I I think Europe really does do a

1632
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,599
better job because if like you look at

1633
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:25,799
France you look at all the people at

1634
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:28,160
inria like a lot of the people that I

1635
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:31,079
that I mentioned are like at inria or

1636
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,920
like were in Europe um because like you

1637
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:35,359
know Germany has Max plank institutes

1638
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,880
and and like France has has inria and

1639
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,640
like we have these other you know

1640
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,920
basically like government funded

1641
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,319
organizations where they're like we're

1642
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,000
going to do fundamental research and

1643
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:45,920
computational number Theory and it will

1644
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,480
be good for the world um so yeah it

1645
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,839
might be nice to have that um

1646
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,760
structurally I mean I think one one

1647
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:56,599
issue in the US is it's great that the

1648
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:58,680
like most of our universities are funded

1649
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:01,160
by the governments in a lot of ways but

1650
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,760
it's led to weird incentives like I'm at

1651
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,319
the University of California which like

1652
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,599
originally was generously funded by the

1653
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,160
state of California but they've like

1654
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:11,039
been cutting funding over

1655
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:15,920
the um over the decades and then it's

1656
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:18,319
been made up for by NSF funding but like

1657
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:21,160
if we have political instability that is

1658
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:24,480
like causing our grants

1659
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:27,000
to come into question then like it's

1660
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,400
hard to yeah but then then people are

1661
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,079
making up that for that by like let's

1662
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,319
get corporate funding but now the

1663
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:36,240
corporations are like we only want to

1664
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:39,839
fund AI um so yeah I mean it's it's a

1665
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:41,680
mess a little bit Yeah AB question so

1666
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,279
you talk about how there's um some like

1667
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,240
a lot of attack know things that um

1668
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:47,720
there not enough money cost so cost a

1669
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,599
lot of money cost need a lot of

1670
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:52,079
expertise need a lot of you know effort

1671
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:55,200
that is like just kind of not for plot

1672
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:57,359
of to do it doesn't this also mean that

1673
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,119
like are so hard not wor doing like

1674
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:04,960
nobody want you try to do it and so like

1675
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:04,960
it's going to be secure for a while

1676
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:12,359
well so okay is is um if the attack is

1677
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,760
is too much of a pain for academics to

1678
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:15,680
carry out does that mean that the scheme

1679
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:19,440
is

1680
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:22,480
secure um so I would argue that um the

1681
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,359
incentives of uh different organizations

1682
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,400
are different and so we know that there

1683
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:26,960
we know that there are governments who

1684
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:31,720
have have a very strong incentive to

1685
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:34,319
break cryptography um and so if the I

1686
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:38,359
guess the question is like if you are

1687
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:40,000
Google and you consider both the NSA and

1688
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:42,200
the Chinese government to be a potential

1689
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,400
adversary in this area and these

1690
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,920
governments are willing to put in

1691
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,319
hundreds of millions of dollars towards

1692
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:51,440
Crypt analysis in the private in in

1693
01:07:47,319 --> 01:07:52,799
their government um uh organizations um

1694
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,160
but they are they are a threat but you

1695
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:58,319
are Google so you're relying on what the

1696
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:01,480
public research Community is telling you

1697
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:03,839
to use um then there's a misalignment

1698
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:06,760
there so say it's possible the

1699
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:08,400
government like you know solve whatever

1700
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,359
the problems

1701
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,720
thats

1702
01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:16,239
are uh absolutely I mean basically as

1703
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:21,080
like as I said if the NSA wasn't

1704
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:23,040
factoring 1024b RSA 15 years ago or more

1705
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,560
where are my tax dollars going like I

1706
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,839
will be personally disappointed if they

1707
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:32,040
do not have like their their machine

1708
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:35,159
just set up like crunching um well both

1709
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:37,880
1024 but just discret log and and

1710
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:39,799
factoring um and like they have people

1711
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,640
who can build special purpose Hardware

1712
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:45,679
they have the best people in the world

1713
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,319
who can design algorithmic improvements

1714
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,159
um even like get constant Factor

1715
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:51,520
improvements that that

1716
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:53,480
like come on it has to be feasible like

1717
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,199
if they're not doing I'm I'm I'm I'm

1718
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,040
very disappointed in them um but like

1719
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:00,560
yeah they they have

1720
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,000
and we know that they they want to do it

1721
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,279
and that they have an actual incentive

1722
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,080
to do it and they have the budget to do

1723
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:08,600
it whereas

1724
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:10,839
like five underpaid French researchers

1725
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:14,880
um are very interested in the topic but

1726
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:18,500
do not have the resources of the

1727
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:25,329
NSA we should there yeah cool

1728
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:25,329
[Applause]
