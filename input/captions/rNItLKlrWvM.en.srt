1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,879
All right, good morning everyone.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,160
Welcome to today's um MPT primer. Uh so

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,000
Manda Arbab is the ladish family

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,000
assistant professor of neurology at the

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,440
Rosman Stone Xander translational

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,279
neuroscience center at Boston Children's

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,039
Hospital. During her PhD at the Hubert

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,680
Institute in the Netherlands, she worked

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,320
on IPSC modeling of neurological

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
diseases and crisper technologies. She

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
completed her post-doal training with

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,079
David Louu at the broad institute where

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
she published papers on high throughput

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,000
characterization of crisper tools and

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,800
developed an invivo genome editing

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,960
therapeutics uh for neurological

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,440
diseases. Her lab which she started in

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
2023 continues to pursue the development

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,600
of genome editing therapeutics for

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
various genetic conditions and works to

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
translate these drugs from bench bench

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239
to bedside. and today she's going to be

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,840
talking about a recent paper um called

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,640
base editing triplet repeats of

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,879
Huntington's disease and Frederick's

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,879
dictaxia. Thank

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,280
you very much um for that introduction.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,320
Um okay. Um yes, that's exactly what I'm

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,159
here to speak about today. So I'm going

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,200
to jump right in. Um our uh lab focuses

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,960
on the development uh of genome editing

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
therapeutics for various different

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,439
neurological diseases. um starting from

34
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,560
identification of uh good targets uh and

35
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,400
strategies there for um and then first

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,799
validating these in vitro and then

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
ultimately um taking them into animal

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,520
models with the end goal of uh taking

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,720
them into clinic and so also doing the

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,600
um IND enabling studies uh for that and

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,200
we're mo mostly been focused on um

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
neurological disorders that affect

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
movement uh including motor neuron

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,719
diseases um as well as repeat expansion

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,000
disorders which are mainly going to be

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
focusing on today. Um, so I'm confident

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
that you are all well aware of uh

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
crisperbased editing. So obviously

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
doesn't need much introduction, but I

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,959
just briefly want to highlight a few

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,200
aspects of these tools that are going to

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,840
be um relevant that you maybe don't

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,520
think about as much. So uh base editing

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,080
is a technology that utilizes um the

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,800
sort of search and find function of cast

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,840
9 but couples the cast 9 protein to a

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,040
daminase enzyme. And what this allows is

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,040
that when cast 9 binds and the guide RNA

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,280
hybridizes with one of the strands of

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,239
the DNA, the other singlestranded um

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,480
portion of DNA becomes available uh for

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
this chemistry by the damnase enzyme to

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480
be able to happen. And uh in the case of

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
for example an adinine base editor, it

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,840
can turn this uh adenosine into an

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,400
innocine that is recognized as a G. And

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,800
then through uh DNA repair, this

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,000
mismatched position here is resolved

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,959
into um a stable uh base ultimately

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,560
turning an AT pair into a GC pair. Um so

71
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,480
in principle I guess the two things I

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
want to highlight any singlestranded DNA

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,959
is made available to the diaminise.

74
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,800
Obviously this is uh localized by the

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
cast 9 but this is also what stops the

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
diaminase from in general just

77
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,840
daminating all of the genome. Um and

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,319
also uh base editors typically will use

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,400
uh not a dead cast 9 that only searches

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,080
and finds but in fact a nickase. And the

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,400
role of the nickase is to nick the

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
strand that opposes the one where the

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,280
damination event occurs. And the reason

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,280
for this is that nicks are more rapidly

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,680
identified by DNA repair as being

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,879
problematic. And so you will um

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,840
typically then end up having the strand

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,000
that had the original uh nucleotide of

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,000
the pair on it being rected and

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,040
templated off of the strand that has the

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,640
daminated um position. And so you are in

92
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,120
fact biasing then your outcomes to uh

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,799
resolving in favor of the change that

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,920
you have made rather than reverting

95
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,400
50/50 or less than that um to the uh

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,239
original base card that was there. So

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,480
initially um a couple years ago we

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,040
demonstrated uh the use of this admin

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
based editing technology to treat uh a

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
different disorder. This is a motor

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,440
neuron disease called spinal muscular

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,320
atrophy or SMA. Um in this uh disorder

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,840
uh most often um infants pretty much as

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,560
soon as they are born begin to present

105
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,720
with symptoms ultimately leading to uh

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
paralysis and if untreated these

107
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,120
patients will not survive past about 18

108
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,840
months. And SMA is in fact the leading

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
genetic cause of infant death globally.

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
And even though uh to this day we still

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
don't actually understand the mechanism

112
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,440
of pathology that leads to the loss of

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,759
motor neurons, we've known for about

114
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,800
three decades that uh this disease is

115
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,479
caused by the loss of this uh essential

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,040
SMN1 gene with retention always of this

117
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,240
SM2 gene which is almost identical to

118
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,960
SM1 except for one CDT transition that

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,919
causes a splice variant. um and as a

120
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,479
result SM2 genes produce only about 10%

121
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,560
of the functional protein and SMN1 would

122
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,280
and the different um subclasses uh shown

123
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,440
here of severity actually relate to the

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,720
copy number of SM2 that patients have.

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,800
So it was known that it's a dose

126
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,199
responsive gene if you up the amount of

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,639
SMN uh you can also restore this

128
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,840
disorder. So uh we developed a base

129
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,160
editing strategy um to treat this uh

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,919
shown here. So we turn this AT pair into

131
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,440
the C GC pair that um is the one that is

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,199
found typically in SMN1 genes. Um and

133
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,080
after validating this in vitro, we

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,120
delivered this into animals using AV9.

135
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,360
AV9 importantly is a vector that is used

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,960
uh to deliver SM gene therapy to

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,880
estimate patients very successfully in

138
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
the clinic. So we have prior knowledge

139
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
not only in animal models but in

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,479
patients that this actually does deliver

141
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,800
cargo efficaciously to the target tissue

142
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,840
of interest. Um and what we were happy

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,240
to find is that in uh neurons that get

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,160
transduced in vivo about 90% of them

145
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,440
have this conversion of the insufficient

146
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,000
SMN2 gene to the SMN1

147
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,479
gene. Um and through some uh additional

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,720
optimization. So the uh mouse model that

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,600
we were working with for SMA is one that

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,280
um has a very rapid decline. uh so do

151
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,039
the human patients but in animals what

152
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,280
this means is that uh if you don't

153
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,960
rescue uh the SMN levels by about five

154
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,160
days after birth you really aren't

155
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,000
rescuing their survival at all their

156
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,360
median survival is about 17 days without

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,600
any treatment um what we did is we uh

158
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
used a bridging drug essentially one of

159
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,319
the transient therapeutics that's on the

160
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,280
market for SMA that can very um briefly

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,960
uh by rescuing splicing um ameliorate

162
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,680
disease so we gave a very small dose

163
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,120
only a single time uh at time point zero

164
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,520
and that alone alone um is able to uh

165
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
that the ASO that we use alone is able

166
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,759
to increase the median life expectancy

167
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,919
from 17 days to 29 days. But when we

168
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,440
then couple that together with our um

169
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,720
base editing drug, we can now see the

170
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,039
median survival increase pretty

171
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,280
dramatically to 77 days. Um and actually

172
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,919
to be fair, the animals that die after

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,280
this um time point actually aren't dying

174
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,199
of motor neuron disease. They don't sort

175
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
of like slowly paralyze and and and

176
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,080
decline in that way. They typically are

177
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,520
just running around and then drop dead.

178
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,880
Um, and that's because this animal

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,720
model, and this is specific to the

180
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,319
animal, not human patients, um, has a

181
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
cardiac phenotype that's associated with

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,240
the disease as well. Um, and as you can

183
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,599
see here, this is an example of, um,

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
what these animals actually look like.

185
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,520
So, I think a video is probably more

186
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,360
telling than a graph. Um, this is at 200

187
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,599
days old. We have an animal that's

188
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,039
treated with ASO uh, and the base editor

189
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,960
compared to one of its wild type litter

190
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,800
mates. And as you can see, it's mobile

191
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,479
and happily moving around. Um, it's not

192
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,840
entirely normal looking. Uh, you'll

193
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,160
notice among other things, it's missing

194
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,599
a tail. But this also is something that

195
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,919
we know um we're not really worried

196
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,000
about in case of human patients because

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
humans don't have tail. Um but also

198
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
because the peripheral phenotypes again

199
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,479
are ones that are related to the animal

200
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
model and not um to the human condition.

201
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,280
Um so now that we had uh demonstrated

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,039
this um in this paradigm and we're as I

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,960
mentioned continuing to uh do the

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,840
pre-clinical development of this drug we

205
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,039
wanted to go ahead and um start uh

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,360
working on an entirely different uh also

207
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,000
uh deterministic genetic disease which

208
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,240
is um the first disease actually that

209
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,759
was known to be associated with the gene

210
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
uh was discovered back in the 80s which

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,520
is the Huntington gene.

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,080
So uh the mutation in the Huntington

213
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,560
gene is pretty much a a very different

214
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,159
form. Um it's part of a class of what

215
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,560
are known as tandem repeat disorders

216
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,800
specifically trucleide repeat disorders.

217
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,959
Uh and these are caused by expansion of

218
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,839
a repeated triplet of nucleotides. And

219
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,600
so TNRS as a class uh include around 40

220
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
different disorders that are caused by

221
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
sematic expansion of the repeat

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,800
sequence. Um these include sequences

223
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,560
like CAG, CA, G, uh CTG, GAA, and

224
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,320
CGD. Um and they frequently cause loss

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,040
of motor coordination, and they're also

226
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
very often fatal. Uh there are many

227
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
features that distinguish these

228
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,959
different um diseases uh including the

229
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,720
genes that they're located in, the

230
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,959
location within the genes um that

231
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
they're located in as well. Uh and the

232
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,959
sequence itself um and the sequence

233
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
itself is responsible for secondary

234
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
structure that these uh the DNA can

235
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,880
form. um and all complications that

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,560
arise from that. Uh and Huntington's

237
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,800
disease specifically falls into a

238
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,839
subcategory that we call polyglutamine

239
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,839
or polyQ disorders because CAG um when

240
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,320
found in an exxon um encodes for

241
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,399
glutamine. Uh however um both KAGs and

242
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,560
CTG which is its reverse complement are

243
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,200
found both in coding and non-coding uh

244
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,440
region of the genome. Um and they do

245
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,360
similarly uh undergo these expansions

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080
that are associated with some form of

247
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,240
disease. Um and then there's also uh

248
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
Friedri's taxia which is a disease um

249
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,240
that's caused by the expansion of these

250
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,440
GAA um nucleotides that are located uh

251
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,240
in the first intron of the freaxin gene.

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,600
So how do um repeats end up causing

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,200
these? Well, a common feature um of all

254
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
of these that I've described even though

255
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,440
they can differ quite drastically with

256
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,320
their location is that they are in fact

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,279
all um transcribed. And what happens

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
during transcription is that uh an R

259
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,360
loop can form where the newly

260
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,000
synthesized RNA can hybridize um with

261
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,800
the template strand leaving the

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,560
non-template strand exposed. And because

263
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,279
that sequence is highly repetitive and

264
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,120
in most cases as you see also very

265
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:36,160
GC-rich this forms secondary structures

266
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,480
that when the DNA is trying to hybridize

267
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,560
together once again uh can slip out and

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
these slip out structures then cause

269
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,200
also slipping out on the opposing strand

270
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,760
where you have these loops um that come

271
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,680
out uh and these become um a problem

272
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,079
that DNA needs to deal with and they

273
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,480
also become more vulnerable to uh for

274
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,920
example oxidative stress stress or um

275
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
cytosine damination that also native

276
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,279
atively happens in the cell all the

277
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
time. Uh as a result of this you get

278
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,680
nicks and these nicks that need to be

279
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,279
resolved and because the sequence is so

280
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,839
repetitive it becomes very difficult for

281
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,760
DNA repair to know exactly where that

282
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,519
repeat that it's trying to resolve was

283
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,959
supposed to match. And so what happens a

284
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,680
lot of the time is that it matches in an

285
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,680
incorrect place which then uh results in

286
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,480
a change in length of the repeat. So it

287
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,880
can either shorten, contract or uh it

288
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,279
can expand and this is what we refer to

289
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,120
as instability of the locus. Um and what

290
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,440
we know is that the instability of these

291
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,920
lowi increases as the length of the

292
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
repeat itself increases most likely

293
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,240
because you know the longer it is the

294
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
more far away it is from the anchoring

295
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,800
um points of the side that aren't

296
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:45,440
repetitive. Um but uh the

297
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,320
um so and sorry and while it uh can both

298
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,240
contract and and expand um when repeats

299
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
are on the shorter side they tend to

300
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,120
favor contraction more whereas as they

301
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,120
lengthen um they tend to favor

302
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,680
expansion. And so you get this feedback

303
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,079
loop where a long repeat then when it's

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,519
unstable favors adding more repeats on.

305
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,120
And so then it becomes again more

306
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
unstable and is more likely to again

307
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,079
acquire more and so on and so on. And so

308
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,480
that's how it um has this uh essentially

309
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,040
um ends up being an outofcontrol um

310
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,800
expansion of these repeat lossi. Um and

311
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,560
so what does it look like? It looks

312
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,360
something uh like this. So here we can

313
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,360
for example see

314
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,120
a set of alals.

315
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,880
Okay.

316
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,560
Oh, appointment toward my

317
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,240
computer. No, I think this works. Does

318
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,800
this

319
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,839
work? No. Well, anyway, you can see it

320
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,720
over here. um you can see a a set of

321
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,680
alals basically um that you can start

322
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,360
with. So in this case uh the um median

323
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,360
al size is around um 80 repeats long. Uh

324
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,600
and over time if you look six months

325
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,079
later you can see that um this peak has

326
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,800
diverged and the majority of alals now

327
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,560
have lengthened uh to get over 100

328
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
repeats. And there's also a subfraction

329
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,440
that has become smaller um at 76

330
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,560
repeats. And this is uh this um

331
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,120
instability phenomenon um and this

332
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,120
happens uh in sematic cells. So patients

333
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
in the germ line they are born with a

334
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
certain length and there are some

335
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,279
sematic cells uh where this expansion

336
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,440
can happen. Um one of the sematic cells

337
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,200
in which this happens as well um if you

338
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
can call it that is is germline cells.

339
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,120
And so uh for a lot of these disorders

340
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
during spermatogenesis there actually

341
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,120
also is an addition sometimes of one uh

342
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,720
or more um of these repeats uh and what

343
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,160
that can result in is that uh there

344
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,519
might not have been a family history of

345
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,680
for example Huntington's disease but

346
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,560
then suddenly denovo in a new generation

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,480
you can have um now uh what will be

348
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,480
hereditary um Huntington's disease in

349
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,880
that population and this is a process

350
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,320
that's called

351
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,000
anticipation. Um so the as mentioned

352
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
once they're if they are of a certain

353
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,440
length they will be stable. Um and so it

354
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,880
should be noted that in all of these

355
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
genes the repeat sequences that I've

356
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,360
showed you um are present in the general

357
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,880
population. We all have these repeats

358
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,040
but we have them up until a certain

359
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,079
length that is considered stable. So in

360
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,240
the case of Huntington's having about um

361
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,760
10 to 26 of these repeats is pretty

362
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,800
normal and that's most likely what most

363
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,399
of us have. If you have about 27 to 35

364
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
of them then you might be at increased

365
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,519
risk of anticipation where subsequent

366
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,079
generations could uh gain um the the uh

367
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:28,639
pathology. Um and then after that if you

368
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:31,920
are um 36 uh to about 39 repeats there

369
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,160
is uh low risk there's lower penetrance

370
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,480
um of uh the disease and that probably

371
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,480
relates to other apologenic um risk

372
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,720
factors uh that some of which have begun

373
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
to become elucidated but 40 with

374
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
Huntington's disease is a threshold. If

375
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,760
you have 40 repeats or more, it is

376
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,399
deterministic that you will get

377
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Huntington's disease. Um, and the timing

378
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,160
when you will get is dependent um on

379
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,800
that length as well. So, as you can see

380
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,560
um if you are have a germline length, so

381
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,720
born of about 40 repeats, you're likely

382
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
to get honey in about your 50s, but if

383
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,399
you have 60 repeats now, you're more

384
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,240
likely to get it in about your 20s. Um

385
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,199
and in particular in sort of that 40 to

386
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,760
45 range, every additional CAG that you

387
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,680
have at germ lang length uh will

388
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:18,639
increase um sorry will um bring the age

389
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,399
of onset forward by over a year. Um so

390
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,240
it's a pretty um

391
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,480
uh sensitive uh portion of this and

392
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,399
that's probably because of this um fact

393
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
uh Leo was explaining where more repeats

394
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,160
beget more repeats and so you are

395
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,000
getting closer to that tipping point of

396
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,320
where you sort of end up um going more

397
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,160
rapidly out of control.

398
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,959
Uh so um one of the many curious aspects

399
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,839
of this disease is the latency until the

400
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,199
age of onset because once the disease

401
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,040
does manifest um the symptoms also tend

402
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,199
to manifest more quickly. But it does

403
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,399
seem to be true uh based on a battery of

404
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,480
um motor and cognitive tests um that up

405
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,720
until the point that patients get

406
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,440
Huntington's disease they are not

407
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,959
subclinical. They do not have um what

408
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
seems to be some small degree of

409
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,480
pathology that goes unnoticed that

410
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,759
slowly linearly builds up and then they

411
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,160
have disease. They don't have it and

412
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,880
then it suddenly happens. Um so how is

413
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,000
this possible? Uh and

414
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:22,959
why? Um and

415
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,959
uh to answer that earlier this year

416
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,199
there was a really beautiful paper that

417
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,360
came out from the Carol lab um where

418
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,600
they were able to look at uh the um

419
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,600
stryatum uh some cells from the stratum

420
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,920
neurons of uh deceased Huntington's

421
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,279
patients which is really of course as

422
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,360
you can imagine a pretty unique thing

423
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,920
where they performed single cell um on

424
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,120
these brains uh and they um carefully

425
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,519
studied uh the relationship between the

426
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,839
transcriptto and the repeat length um to

427
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,680
try to see you know how is it that

428
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,560
Huntington is actually progressing and

429
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,160
they were able to then um subdivide uh

430
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,519
the disease progression into different

431
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,160
phases A through D A through E and phase

432
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,000
A um it's the slow expansion phase and

433
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,480
this phase lasts several decades this is

434
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
where patients do not at all um have any

435
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,280
symptoms and apparently this is up to

436
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,360
about 80 repeats long then phase B after

437
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,079
this tipping point of 80 repeats has

438
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,919
been reached in some sematic cells. This

439
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,079
uh

440
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,039
expansion rapidly accelerates and then

441
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,120
once you hit 150 repeats now these cells

442
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,919
suddenly um begin to have over 500 or or

443
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,360
more genes uh that become disregulated.

444
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,640
At this point the cell is losing its

445
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,360
cell identity. Um and ultimately uh as

446
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,679
this um exacerbates uh they get uh

447
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
derpression of um certain key

448
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,160
developmental and scinessence and

449
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,400
eptosis markers. Uh and then after that

450
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,039
very quickly um the neuron dies.

451
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,919
Um what is uh also really important to

452
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,960
note here however is that it seems to be

453
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,880
that there uh may well be a reasonable

454
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,280
therapeutic window for treatment of

455
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:08,080
patients um based on their analysis not

456
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,600
only if you can catch uh neurons before

457
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,080
they hit this 150 mark and so before um

458
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,760
patients begin to uh have any symptoms

459
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,240
of Huntington's disease where many

460
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,840
neurons can be lost but even when

461
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,039
neurons are beginning to be lost and

462
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120
patients are starting to suffer from

463
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,919
Huntington's disease, the majority of

464
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,400
the neurons um in their brain actually

465
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,600
have not yet met this point. So even at

466
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,520
the point that about 25% of uh these

467
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,280
neurons are lost um 90% of the neurons

468
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,440
have still not actually hit this 150

469
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,440
point which means that if you can find a

470
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,679
way to intervene in this process of this

471
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,240
expansion that ultimately leads to

472
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,640
disease you would have an opportunity to

473
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,679
rescue um the bulk of neurons um and

474
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,480
treat patients. And if you wanted to um

475
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,559
resolve it al together uh based on sort

476
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
of their their modeling if you had

477
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,039
someone born with about 40 repeats which

478
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,799
is most people um then if you would be

479
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,559
able to treat them before they're pretty

480
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,039
much in their 40s you might be able to

481
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,799
hold off Huntington's disease at all. So

482
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,440
what would be a way of being able to

483
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,039
intervene in this expansion process? Um

484
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,080
there was a G-W was study that came out

485
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,480
in 2019 that looked at genetic

486
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,400
associations with Huntington's disease

487
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,960
and the major finding from that is

488
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,919
actually that the sequence itself um is

489
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:31,039
extremely important uh in this expansion

490
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,720
process. Uh so in most people um I

491
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,840
believe also including most hundreds

492
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,640
patients uh the kagg repeat the polyq

493
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,360
region is not just kags uh there is a

494
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,760
penultimate caa that happens which also

495
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,679
includes q. So the polyq length is

496
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,960
actually two nucle two codons longer um

497
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,919
than the uh than the kag repeat stretch

498
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,320
is. um and that is considered sort of

499
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,440
this gray uh normal line that you can

500
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,080
see here um in the middle that predicts

501
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,039
your age of onset based on length. Um

502
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,640
however uh very often and more so uh in

503
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,760
Huntington's population than in the

504
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,720
general population that uh penultimate

505
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,640
CAA is lost and when it is lost which is

506
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,799
the red line you can see that the age of

507
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,760
onset um is much uh approaches much more

508
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,000
quickly at the same polyQ length than it

509
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,799
does if you did have that one CAA

510
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,080
interruption. And then in some um cases

511
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,320
that CAA CAG is actually duplicated and

512
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,240
there the age of onset is much further.

513
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,919
Uh so having just um a single or

514
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,320
multiple of these CAA silent uh codon

515
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,400
changes is able to have a pretty

516
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,799
profound impact in the age of onset of

517
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,799
this disease. Um and if you look overall

518
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,000
across the population, patients that

519
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,919
have pure CAD repeats versus uh polyQues

520
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,720
of a similar length but with a single CA

521
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,280
interruption um that delays the onset of

522
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,760
Huntington's disease by 25 years. Uh

523
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,480
which is obviously um quite a profound

524
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,840
difference. Um and from what we uh know

525
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,600
this isn't unique to Huntington's

526
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,200
disease. So Friedrix taxia as I

527
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,960
mentioned is another disorder that is

528
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,320
caused by GA expansion. So a different

529
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,200
sequence altogether. um there isn't as

530
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,799
large scale of study um as was done for

531
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,760
uh Huntington's disease, but here it is

532
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,840
also apparent that having interruptions

533
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,320
in the GA repeat track that's found in

534
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,799
the intron of GGA, Gag GggG um is able

535
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,000
to also very significantly by several

536
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,720
decades in some cases uh stave off this

537
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,600
um this uh onset of the disease uh most

538
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,039
likely again due to the repeat expansion

539
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,000
and this to a certain degree had been

540
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,440
known from um prior work on uh bacterial

541
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,960
cells, yeast, you know, where people had

542
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,720
inserted these sorts of sequences to

543
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
study the process of repeat expansion

544
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,679
that these interruptions really are very

545
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,799
important um in determining the um

546
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,919
frequency of uh repeat expansions um and

547
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,159
the rate of it.

548
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,760
So why is this important? We have a

549
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,000
technology that allows us to make single

550
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,159
nucleide changes in the genome. And so

551
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,880
we um set out to develop uh two

552
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,039
different strategies. one targeting um

553
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,919
on the opposing strand of CAG so CT ctg

554
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,400
CTG um a genome editing strategy that's

555
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,559
able to convert um CAGs into the

556
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,760
synonymous CADons

557
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,640
uh and then on the um GAA side one

558
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,000
that's also able to insert um A to G

559
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,000
changes in the GAA repeats in the intron

560
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,320
um to hopefully have a stabilizing

561
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,960
effect on these

562
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:39,440
repeats. So it is a bit of an unusual

563
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,200
strategy for genome editing which is uh

564
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,039
typically the the goal is to be as

565
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,120
precise as possible and target only one

566
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,880
genomic location. Here we had a

567
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,799
different goal. Um and here we designed

568
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,559
our guide RNA in a way to essentially be

569
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,720
somewhat non-specific to the entire

570
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,360
repeat region. Um our thinking was that

571
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,840
it would allow it to somewhat um

572
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,679
sporadically um intersperse um

573
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,240
interruptions across the length of the

574
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,840
repeat tract. uh and with longer AP

575
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,840
tracks it would allow you to insert more

576
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,000
of these stabilizing um mutations. Uh so

577
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,559
we developed a strategy that would then

578
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,799
as mentioned uh use cytosine damination

579
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,559
to convert um CAGs into CAS. Uh and we

580
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,480
looked at uh a bunch of different

581
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,720
strategies to do so with um the

582
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,039
available daminas at the time and we

583
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,120
were really happy to find that uh a

584
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,120
great number of them were able to edit

585
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,240
this locus with high efficiency. So this

586
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,039
is in a screen in HET 93T cells um that

587
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,880
have only 17 CAGS so relatively short as

588
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,960
it's a normal number um and I want to

589
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,840
draw your focus initially to the ones

590
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,360
that are on this side of the graph um

591
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,520
and you can see that uh the editing

592
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,240
itself is quite high but we also have um

593
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,159
these other byproducts that are uh not

594
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,919
as desirable um that you can see in

595
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,480
particular these stop codons. So where

596
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,559
are these stop codons coming from? Um as

597
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,480
mentioned before uh the reason that

598
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,840
cytosine damination um happens uh in the

599
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,400
portion that you're targeting your your

600
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,000
guide to is because the guide RNA binds

601
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,760
the other strand and it makes available

602
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,919
the single stranded DNA on the opposing

603
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,840
strand. Um however we have seen in the

604
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,640
past from hyper characterizations of

605
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,360
these tools that you can sometimes see

606
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,000
editing happening outside uh on the pam

607
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,440
distal end um of the guide RNA sequence

608
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,960
that you're targeting. Um and in

609
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,200
particular this is also noticeable on

610
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,720
the opposing strand um that you're

611
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,919
getting uh some of these damination

612
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,840
events. And this is likely due to

613
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
breathing um of the DNA as you're having

614
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,279
this binding event here. And this is

615
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,520
typically a very rare thing that happens

616
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,039
only with um some cytosine base editors

617
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,039
but most likely because we're having so

618
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,480
many con you know uh consecutive binding

619
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,159
events happening. You might have more of

620
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,919
that. And so we actually see some

621
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,480
editing of the opposing strand here. And

622
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,799
that in this case would result in TAA or

623
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,720
TAG uh stop code on confirmation. Now,

624
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,799
this is not something that we want uh we

625
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,120
think at least we probably don't want to

626
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,840
knock out the Huntington gene. So, we

627
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,720
made a bunch of architectural changes to

628
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,360
um alter the uh the frequency um of

629
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,919
these uh still relatively rare uh

630
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,559
outcomes and also somewhat um increase

631
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,720
efficiency. Um and ultimately we picked

632
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,960
a strategy which is this 32NLS strategy

633
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,880
to move forward with. And then uh we

634
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,880
took this strategy and we wanted to

635
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
apply it in the context of longer

636
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,880
repeats because we don't know how it

637
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,400
will behave um just because it does

638
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
certain thing at 17 repeats we don't

639
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,799
know what it will do at longer repeats

640
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,120
and so we looked at um patient

641
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,080
fibroblasts uh that have uh different

642
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,600
alle lengths which can be seen here um

643
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,600
shown at the bottom. So there's

644
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,279
typically a normal alil in Huntington's

645
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
patients and a longer alil as can be

646
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,520
seen here. So for example this patient

647
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,760
has one al with 17

648
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,320
Um but we can see across the board that

649
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,159
we actually um get um high editing um at

650
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,159
both alals uh both the long and the

651
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,840
short one um in each of these cell

652
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
lines. And there always seems to be in

653
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,840
fact a little bit of higher editing uh

654
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,919
from what we've seen in the longer al

655
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,279
and shorter one which could make sense

656
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,880
in the sense that you know it's more of

657
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,520
a magnet essentially for multiple

658
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,400
binding events as it is longer. Um, one

659
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,159
slight caveat to um, in particular this

660
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,840
last one here that has a very long

661
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,840
repeat of 180. Um, we do this analysis

662
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,919
by short read aluminina sequencing and

663
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,400
we're actually only able to cover um,

664
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,480
about half of the repeat tract for that

665
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,960
180 al. So we can cover the other alals

666
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,600
because they're within what we can um,

667
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,679
sequence which is about 90 of them but

668
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,520
we can't fully cover the 180. So the

669
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,799
actual editing at that al might in fact

670
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,000
be higher than what is shown here.

671
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,840
Um oh another thing that we were quite

672
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,919
happy to find is that the incidence of

673
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,080
stop codons um was we actually didn't

674
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,840
really see them uh here there was some

675
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,600
minor fraction of um uh ins I believe

676
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,960
but we don't nothing was over sort of

677
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
the untreated condition because these

678
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,760
low side are difficult to sequence so it

679
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,320
probably wasn't even a real finding to

680
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,880
begin with um so that wasn't a concern

681
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,520
anymore um then uh the I think more um

682
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,799
interesting finding is what does this do

683
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,720
to the repeat tract Um so here we can

684
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,360
see um essentially at baseline um the

685
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,400
two alals. So we have the alil uh

686
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,880
histogram for the short al over here and

687
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,640
for the longer alil over here for this

688
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,799
18180 cell line. Um this was the only

689
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,559
cell line with the longest repeats that

690
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,480
uh we could even see expansion happening

691
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,240
in culture. Um which you know kind of

692
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,080
makes sense because we can't culture

693
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,520
these primary cells for so long to see

694
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,360
this process happening. Um but uh so we

695
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,760
monitored these cells um either

696
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,880
untreated uh in blue which is I don't

697
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,880
know if you can see very clearly but

698
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
it's hiding behind this purple um or

699
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,799
with the sitine base editor treated

700
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,200
samples and then we culture this um over

701
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,440
five passages for about 30 days and what

702
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,600
you can see here is that um the

703
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,399
untreated uh expands and gets larger

704
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,279
uh in almost all of the um the the

705
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,840
baseline longer alals uh and our CDE

706
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,399
treated stays um pretty stagnant and in

707
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,799
fact drops in size a little bit. So this

708
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,080
one uh has increased by I think about

709
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,360
five or six repeats and this one's

710
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,919
actually dropped by about five or six

711
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,640
repeats from our starting point. Um so

712
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,200
we've in fact uh demonstrated now that

713
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,360
experimentally if you go in to long

714
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,919
repeats and you make these edits you do

715
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,840
in fact confer the stability um that has

716
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,679
been found previously by association

717
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,919
population.

718
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,240
So then uh as mentioned the um guide RNA

719
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,159
that we're using is not specific. It

720
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,600
targets the repeats. There are more of

721
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,360
these repeats in the genome that don't

722
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,360
just belong to Huntington gene. Um

723
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,240
importantly there are actually about a

724
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,919
dozen or so um different uh trucide

725
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,520
repeat disorders that are caused by CAG

726
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,279
CTG expansion. Um and of course our

727
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,120
genome editing strategy targets each of

728
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,480
these um essentially indiscriminately.

729
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,480
Uh what's really interesting about this

730
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,600
is that you know if you could then in

731
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,520
the future you would have such an

732
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,080
approach that you may uh use in the

733
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,919
clinic um if you validate a drug uh for

734
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,000
any one of these targets that means that

735
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
that drug would also then work for any

736
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,480
of these other um dryucleide repeat

737
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,080
expansion disorders. Um however aside

738
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,919
from ones that are associated with

739
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,279
disease uh and of course in any one

740
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,640
patient only one of them will be

741
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,559
associated with disease the other ones

742
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,080
are still there. um there are very very

743
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,640
many other loi throughout the genome

744
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,640
that also have uh around eight or so

745
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,200
seven or eight of these repeats that

746
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,480
will also be targeted by the strategy.

747
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,960
So uh to sort of get at how many these

748
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,720
are where are they what are they um we

749
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,720
perform circle seek initially. So circle

750
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,720
seek uh is a biochemical assay where you

751
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,159
use a nucleus form of the cast protein

752
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,880
with the guide RNA to nominate li where

753
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,440
the base editor might land um in a cell

754
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,159
condition to uh induce base editing. Um

755
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,480
and we found uh well over 5,000 of these

756
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,559
lossi throughout the genome um of which

757
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,720
about 10% were a perfect match. So they

758
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,840
also just had pure of the kag repeat. So

759
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,520
they're just they're not even off

760
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,799
targets they're alternative targets um

761
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,880
of our guide. uh and then um subasses

762
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,039
that had increasing number of mismatches

763
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,799
which we know are likely in the base

764
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,159
editing context and cells to actually

765
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:18,360
reduce uh the potential for um editing

766
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,360
events there. Um

767
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:25,360
and then we wanted to um look further

768
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,440
into uh what these were. And so uh we

769
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,399
were able to subdivide that out of these

770
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,080
uh 5700 um low side that are potential

771
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:38,399
targets uh about 17% of them code for

772
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,960
proteins. Um and there are uh of the

773
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,120
protein coding offtargets about 15% of

774
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:49,120
them that are a perfect match um for our

775
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,960
CTG. The CTG um or CAGS uh very often

776
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,559
encodes for glutamine but sometimes it's

777
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,480
in its slightly different flame frame

778
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,360
where it can also encode for other amino

779
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,279
acids. Um of the four different um amino

780
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,039
acids that we found that encoded uh

781
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,120
three of them are synonymous changes

782
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,880
glutamine, lucine cysteine um but

783
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,720
serrines will be converted into

784
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,840
asparagene. So that would be a miss

785
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,440
mutation. Uh so we were interested to

786
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,799
find um of the uh roughly 1,00 in

787
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,279
particular the 10,00 perfect match

788
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,320
protein coding loi what those are um but

789
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,279
also of the other offtargets

790
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,720
um how frequently they're actually

791
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,000
occurring and what they're doing. Now

792
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,679
usually when you do circle seek and for

793
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,679
this sort of validation you pick the top

794
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,039
or maybe the entire list of offt targets

795
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,559
to look at in the genome to see whether

796
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,399
or not there's editing but there's

797
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,559
thousands of loi here and so that's not

798
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,080
really something we can do in an arrayed

799
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,679
you know single locus amplification

800
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,000
fashion which is what we typically do.

801
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,000
So we sought and said to do whole genome

802
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,039
sequencing in this case um at very high

803
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,640
coverage 160x uh to be able to see um

804
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,399
after we treat cells with our genome

805
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,240
editing tool what is our likelihood of

806
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,240
actually getting an editing event there.

807
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,679
um even at 160x it is pretty difficult

808
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,519
to get good quality um calling of a

809
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,360
single nucleotide change that happens in

810
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,880
particular in repeat regions that are

811
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,240
very difficult to get through and are

812
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,080
more likely to uh induce errors. Um but

813
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,399
uh if we um we did this nevertheless and

814
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,000
if we look at any lossi that have uh

815
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:17,200
over.5% over background um of a single

816
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,919
nucleide change uh there is about 48% of

817
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,320
circle seek nominated lowi that um we

818
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:28,000
would call as an edit which is um about

819
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:30,399
2743 lowi. Um we did find uh as

820
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,720
anticipated that uh the frequency of

821
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,720
edits decreased steadily with the number

822
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,559
of mismatches. As soon as you have you

823
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,559
know essentially over two mismatches you

824
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,200
don't really get editing at these lowi

825
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,080
um which is uh pretty much expected. Um

826
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,120
we demonstrate this here in a table

827
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,039
where we uh basically subdivide where

828
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,039
the mismatches fall. So it had been

829
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,440
known um from prior work and and was

830
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
reproduced here that uh mismatches in

831
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,640
the guide RNA that are more proximal to

832
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,880
the PAM particular in the seed region

833
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,440
that are shown here in A and B but the

834
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,480
closer uh the worse it is um that those

835
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,600
have a greater impact on uh the um

836
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,039
binding ability um of cast 9. So if you

837
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,039
have mutations here that's worse than if

838
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,799
you have mutations uh in the tail end.

839
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,120
Um and that's what we can see here.

840
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,720
These are uh ones that have no mutations

841
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,080
at all in the entirety of the guide RNA.

842
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,480
you have ones where you have um no

843
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,399
mutations in A but you have uh only

844
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,519
mutation in the C region etc. Um then uh

845
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:33,039
we wanted to um to some degree validate

846
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,720
uh these um uh editing events uh by

847
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,080
doing single locus amplification. And we

848
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,159
find that for the most part our whole

849
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,919
genome sequencing analysis is pretty

850
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,840
accurate at calling it if o

851
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,840
overestimating to a certain degree um

852
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,640
due to our sort of liberal calling u

853
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,120
methods um what the editing frequency

854
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,919
there is.

855
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,159
Um but so ultimately uh we were most

856
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,480
interested in what we thought might be u

857
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,640
mutations of clinical significance. So

858
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,600
we found that indeed the overwhelming

859
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,919
majority of edits um were non-coding

860
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,640
interrogenic or in other regulatory

861
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,639
regions um or inducing silent mutations

862
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,639
and there were a very small subset uh

863
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,560
where there were relatively compared to

864
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,839
what we started with where there were um

865
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,679
potential changes. Um so if we looked at

866
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,679
whole genome sequencing lowside that had

867
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,480
over 5% editing to call it somewhat more

868
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,760
accurately we find that uh over 1200

869
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,879
sites um show editing including 243

870
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,159
genes. Uh and of those 91 genes in total

871
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,280
have um mismatch mutations. Uh so then

872
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,679
we wanted to um ask what are these genes

873
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,599
and how important are they? Uh so we

874
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,159
compared them with the um cancer depth

875
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,679
map to see um if any of these genes are

876
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,480
cell essential and we also looked uh

877
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,079
whether or not these um genes are

878
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,280
expressed in neurons uh because those

879
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
are the ones that we're delivering the

880
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,720
editing to. Um and then we also looked

881
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,119
at alpha missense to see if we're making

882
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,400
these non- synonymous changes uh what is

883
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,960
the likelihood that that will have an

884
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,480
effect on protein building or protein

885
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,800
function. Um and ultimately we found

886
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,280
that there were four uh genes that were

887
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,839
essential that were targeted. Um one of

888
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,560
which has a mutation that is predicted

889
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,640
to result in a change in protein folding

890
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,640
or function. Uh and we only actually

891
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,200
throughout the entire genome found with

892
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,839
our strategy um that we'd optimized uh

893
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,560
to uh induce a stop codon which is also

894
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,079
really nice. Um but that stopcodon was

895
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,680
uh in a gene that is neither essential

896
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,440
nor expressed in neurons. So it's you

897
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,760
know probably not um relevant as not

898
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,079
transcribed in the cells we're

899
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,560
targeting. So in some the basing

900
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,040
approach has quite a lot of offt targets

901
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,800
um that do happen uh some of which may

902
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,800
be a clinical significance. So if this

903
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,599
is something that uh we would ultimately

904
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,160
want to pursue um more for a therapeutic

905
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,200
angle we would need special attention um

906
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,760
on those uh sites in the future. So

907
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,160
ultimately we then wanted to um take

908
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,079
this uh same strategy and see what

909
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,079
happens when we put this into um a uh an

910
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,240
animal system. Um so not just cells in

911
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,160
culture but in an actual organism. And

912
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,359
so we did the same form of delivery uh

913
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,400
where we used AV9 um to inject this uh

914
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,880
basing strategy. Uh we do this alongside

915
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
um a small dose a tenth of a dose of GFP

916
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,640
which is basically just a a trace

917
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,760
control for um transduction efficiency.

918
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,240
Uh and we can see that when we

919
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,079
um sort out these uh nuclei uh and

920
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,079
editing pieces over weeks but at 24

921
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:33,680
weeks we have um around uh 80% editing

922
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,240
of uh targeted nuclei and what does this

923
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,880
do to the repeat alals? So we monitored

924
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,040
uh various cell types over um the time

925
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,800
course so 12 weeks 24 weeks and we

926
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,720
looked at cells both that expand and

927
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,440
don't expand. Um we were really excited

928
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,359
to find that similar to what we found uh

929
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,960
in our cell culture conditions when we

930
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,280
look at the stratum which is the disease

931
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,520
tissue and that also has the most severe

932
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,200
um expansion phenotype in the brain uh

933
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:03,760
we can see in pink relative to gray um a

934
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,160
reduction in these uh the longer hump uh

935
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,079
of expanded alals um and in fact we're

936
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,760
also gaining these contractions here

937
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,560
shown here in pink um that you don't

938
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,200
have in the control condition. So, uh

939
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,440
it's probably easier to see than in that

940
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,720
histogram um in a plot like this. Um

941
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,680
this is an analysis called the

942
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,640
instability index that as the name would

943
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,359
suggest um measures the instability of

944
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,000
alals. Um and as you can see here at

945
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,280
both uh 12 weeks and then more

946
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,599
pronounced at 24 weeks uh in cells that

947
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,079
have uh in animals that have received

948
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,760
the base editor we can see a significant

949
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,119
um drop in the instability index

950
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,520
compared to untreated animals. Um so

951
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,000
this is very exciting. When we were

952
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,160
working on this paper, um another study

953
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,200
came out where they actually generated

954
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,680
animal models that had uh either just

955
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,359
the the CAG repeat as is the classical

956
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,119
version to have in that in that mouse.

957
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,200
Um but they also made versions of that

958
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,359
same alil that had CAGS interspersed. I

959
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,760
think it was every third or so. Um CAG

960
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,160
was a CAA. Um and they demonstrated

961
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,240
there also that that freezes completely

962
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,520
the expansion of repeats. And here we

963
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,599
were able to show for the first time

964
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,280
that inducing these into what are

965
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,040
already long alals in an animal system

966
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,040
where these alals expand, you are

967
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,720
actually also able to do that same thing

968
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,200
where you um you freeze these. Um I will

969
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,400
also note that uh these data also have

970
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,800
to be qualified by the fact that we

971
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,280
didn't have a way of um sorting out only

972
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,359
those cells that had been edited. So

973
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,040
this is actually looking at all cells we

974
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,800
were able to isolate. Um and uh as we

975
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,599
know there's only a subfraction of cells

976
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,280
if you look at the um the bulk basically

977
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,000
uh that's here about you know there's

978
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,599
only maybe about 35% of neurons that

979
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,880
even have the opportunity to be edited

980
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,560
in the first place. Um and so uh this is

981
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,079
again most likely an underrepresentation

982
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,160
of the actual um rescue that

983
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,800
the approach of inducing edits um

984
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,359
actually has on alals. um and it's more

985
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,480
likely that the alals that have edits

986
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,400
are are are likely um to be frozen.

987
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,040
So then we uh want to do the same

988
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,800
strategy for Fredicaxia. So um I think

989
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,720
you all get the the idea here. Um so we

990
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,720
have a guide RNA that targets the GAA

991
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,760
repeats and we want to turn um the some

992
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,320
of those GAAS into having some uh A to G

993
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,200
interruptions. Um and uh

994
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,200
we tried to um several uh different um

995
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,680
cast proteins to target uh in different

996
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,920
frames to induce these sorts of edits.

997
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,359
Um and we were able to do so with um

998
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,520
pretty high efficiency that we were

999
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,599
quite happy with. Um one thing I'll

1000
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,720
point out here is that we have the

1001
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,720
purple bars which are um oh sorry

1002
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,960
actually I think I put the the wrong

1003
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,880
graph up here. I wanted to show the the

1004
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,320
difference between um nicase mediated

1005
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,400
editing which is the classical base

1006
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,560
editor and this deadcast 9 but this

1007
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,720
still suffices. Uh ultimately we went

1008
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,320
for the um abe uh damnase. Um but what

1009
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,880
we did is we actually paired this with a

1010
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,400
deadcast 9. Uh so as mentioned typically

1011
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,640
you have a nicase that makes the

1012
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,880
opposing strand to bias um editing

1013
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,880
toward incorporating uh the edit that

1014
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,200
you want. Um but uh we decided in this

1015
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,440
case because the editor was in fact so

1016
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,280
efficient that we might not need this uh

1017
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,400
and we made it into a dead um cast 9 uh

1018
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,359
meaning that there was no nicase

1019
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,040
activity and there's only the

1020
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,720
damination. So you're going to have

1021
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,480
fewer these conversions um but uh the

1022
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,720
editing is enough that we thought that

1023
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,079
that was fine. Why did we decide to do

1024
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,839
to take this approach? um similar to uh

1025
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,400
CAG CTGs that there are many of in the

1026
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,520
genome um there are orders of magnitude

1027
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,000
more um GAAS the GAA repeat uh in this

1028
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,160
location as well as across the genome

1029
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,720
are in alo elements for the most part

1030
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,920
and these are um dormant uh retro

1031
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,680
transpo transcodons that um we have uh

1032
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,520
interpersed all throughout our genome in

1033
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,079
many many different locations and for

1034
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,839
the most part they form uh they perform

1035
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,319
regulatory functions and introns and

1036
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,960
ITRs um but just due to the sheer number

1037
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,720
of them, we felt like maybe having nicks

1038
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,079
all over the genome in so many locations

1039
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,599
might not be as favorable. And since it

1040
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,960
wasn't really strictly necessary, we

1041
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,839
decided to um omit that um linking

1042
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,520
feature. Uh then we took our best

1043
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,200
strategy um and this uh was done in hect

1044
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,800
cells that only have nine gas at this

1045
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,040
low locus, which is not um a lot. So we

1046
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,560
wanted to have uh transgenic cell lines

1047
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,200
where we had more of these repeats. So

1048
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,720
we derived um nyriionic stem cell lines

1049
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,400
that had uh either 30 or um 60 ga

1050
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,560
repeats which is over the pathogenic

1051
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,560
threshold. Um and we ultimately chose

1052
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,960
our uh top favorite strategy which is an

1053
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,440
NRCH um AB8E editor uh that is able to

1054
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,599
um still induce uh edits at a relatively

1055
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,839
high

1056
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,640
frequency. Um and then uh we also did

1057
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,280
the same thing where we um targeted uh

1058
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,440
patient cells. um patients with

1059
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,920
freedaxia have a much greater number um

1060
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,160
of uh repeat expansions. The expansion

1061
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,560
process goes uh into the thousands um

1062
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,119
for patients that have that. Um so it's

1063
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,400
a slightly different problem than you

1064
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,920
have with CAD repeats where you know

1065
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,240
you're already very much pathogenic if

1066
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,440
you're you know at the 80 range. Um so

1067
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:26,400
these patients cells um had short alil

1068
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:30,720
300 uh 330 sorry and 380 or um 541 and

1069
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,800
and 420 alals. Uh and also actually an

1070
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,359
important thing to note is that while um

1071
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,200
Huntington's disease is a dominant uh

1072
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,280
disease where one al is pathogenic in

1073
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,960
the case of Fredricaxia it's actually

1074
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,640
recessive and so patients will have two

1075
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,440
alals um that are um that are uh

1076
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,000
affected. Uh so here we um performed

1077
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,839
editing again uh and measured the

1078
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,319
editing that we got at these repeat

1079
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,079
lossi. Um again here we're stuck with

1080
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,720
this limitation of aluminina sequencing

1081
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,800
where we can only edit uh sequence about

1082
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,520
300 base pairs which covers for us about

1083
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,599
380 of these GAAS. Um and as you can

1084
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,480
imagine even in our uh shortest of these

1085
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,800
alals that's 330 repeats long that's a

1086
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,040
very small portion of it. Um now we

1087
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,040
sequenced both from one end and the

1088
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,520
other end uh and we have essentially the

1089
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,440
same data suggesting that uh the editing

1090
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,880
as expected is happening uniformly

1091
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,200
across the repeat which is also what we

1092
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,000
see in any of the shorter long repeat

1093
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,599
alals. Um but uh because this is such an

1094
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
underestimation, we developed this

1095
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,480
extrapolation model um to say, okay, if

1096
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,880
this is the amount of um editing that we

1097
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,640
have here, what does that mean? Uh can

1098
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,520
we estimate how much editing we'd have

1099
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,520
across the rest of the le um and uh

1100
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,760
determine what the editing probably

1101
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,920
actually is at these lowi? Um and so we

1102
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,240
estimate that our editing um at these

1103
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,760
alals is actually around about

1104
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,079
80%.

1105
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,520
Yes. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'm almost done.

1106
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,520
Actually, I think I Yeah. Um, so then uh

1107
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,480
one other um valuable thing about

1108
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,319
Friedri's taxia um is that uh we

1109
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,880
actually know the cause of the disease

1110
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,880
is that when these repeats get so long,

1111
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,960
they silence the genomic locus and there

1112
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,280
is reduced expression of the FXM gene.

1113
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,440
So we wanted to see does our editing

1114
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,760
actually affect this um loss in

1115
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,839
expression. Um and we were not

1116
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,560
necessarily expecting that it it would

1117
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:26,400
per se um but it did which was uh quite

1118
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,960
a good finding. Um so in untreated um

1119
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,920
short normal uh fibroblasts the level of

1120
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,680
expression we basically uh normalize um

1121
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,079
to one and then uh if we compare um

1122
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,960
patient fibroblasts with uh the long

1123
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,000
repeats either untreated or treated with

1124
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,520
an unrelated guide RNA um you have only

1125
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,480
about half of the expression and you

1126
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,520
rescue about half of that loss um by

1127
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,599
doing this uh base editing interruption.

1128
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,520
Um I guess I'll breeze past the fact

1129
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,760
that we also did uh whole genome

1130
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,440
sequencing and circle seek here as

1131
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,119
mentioned an order of magnitude more

1132
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,440
hits but actually a way smaller

1133
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,920
subfraction that are um coding because

1134
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,079
again these repeats mainly arise from

1135
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,240
these aloe elements that are uh

1136
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,319
regulatory sequences. um and we did not

1137
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,319
find any stop codeons and for the most

1138
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,800
part our basitting strategy just mimics

1139
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,240
the natural variation of inducing these

1140
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,760
um ag changes in repeat tracts. Uh there

1141
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,920
are uh a very small number that um do uh

1142
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,000
warrant further study um because they

1143
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,640
are uh potentially in in regions that

1144
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,800
might have um a negative effect. Um and

1145
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,160
then we did this in animal models. So

1146
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,040
just to take you through that quickly as

1147
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,480
well um both in animals with 300 repeats

1148
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:46,319
or 800 repeats uh our estimated editing

1149
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,200
um is around 60% of alals um and this

1150
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,960
has a profound impact um on the

1151
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,400
instability index as well. If we look

1152
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,280
here at the cortex where we can have

1153
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,760
significant expansion, um our edited uh

1154
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,319
cells have um much more stable um alals.

1155
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,640
Uh and this is even more striking uh

1156
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:10,079
when you compare uh the longer uh 800

1157
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,640
mouse uh relative to the 300 mouse. Um

1158
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,960
so I will leave it at that. Thank you

1159
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,920
very much uh for listening. I want to

1160
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,640
give a huge massive shout out to uh

1161
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,280
co-lead author on the paper. um who's a

1162
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,359
brilliant uh now posttock in Palar

1163
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,359
Lada's lab. She um was a graduate

1164
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,359
student in David's lab uh where I was

1165
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,280
doing my posttock and that's where all

1166
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,319
of this work was done. So also major

1167
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,480
shout out of course to David who um you

1168
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:38,240
know allowed us uh to do all this

1169
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,240
incredible work and this was also done

1170
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,040
in collaboration with Lucardo Muropa's

1171
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,680
lab. Uh he runs a lab over at MGH um and

1172
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,079
is an expert in uh both of these and and

1173
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,560
other repeat extension disorders. uh

1174
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,680

1175
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,240
help us with um virus um Arthur Burgess

1176
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,040
who also collaborated on the um SMA

1177
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,119
project and Cat Lutz over at Jax um

shown here uh who have also helped uh

1180
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,880
some of who helped take this paper over

1181
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:12,560
the finish line um and of course our um

1182
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,560
funding sources that uh NIH so who's

1183
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,079
able to help support um you know all

1184
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,240
this really important work so thank you
