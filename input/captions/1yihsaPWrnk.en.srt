GIOVANNI TRAVERSO: Whenever
one is able to bring together

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,780
different disciplines and
different bodies of knowledge,

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,120
we really stand to have
a transformative impact

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,145
on major problems.

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,580

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,760
I see myself as both a
physician and an engineer.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,510
To me, bringing
those two domains

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,960
together is what really can
help transform and accelerate

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,020
our capacity to develop
new biomedical devices

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,470
or new therapies for
a range of conditions.

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,990
My dad is from Peru,
which is where I grew up,

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,810
and my mother is from Nicaragua.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,110
And we left at the end
of the '80s at the height

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,900
of the instability and were
able to emigrate to Canada.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,410
When I was in high school, I
had the incredible opportunity

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,560
to actually spend time in a lab.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,590
I really fell in love
with molecular genetics,

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,860
and I really loved the lab
environment and that ability

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,280
to investigate a very specific
problem with the hopes

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
that those developments
will eventually help people.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,070
I started medical school
right after high school,

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,290
but in England at the
University of Cambridge.

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,160
I interrupted my medical
training with a PhD

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,140
at Johns Hopkins.

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,660
I had a tremendous
interest for the applied,

27
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,060
but I decided to go
back to medical school

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,190
and then pursue further
medical training.

29
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,700
And then I moved to Boston.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,955

31
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:34,330
I had the tremendous
good fortune

32
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,790
of being offered the
faculty position here

33
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,600
in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering.

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,950
Being embedded in the Mechanical
Engineering Department

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,050
is this incredible opportunity
to engage with students, as well

36
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,290
as faculty, in the development
of the next generation

37
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,710
of medical devices.

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,370
And at the heart or the
core of many of those

39
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,320
medical devices are fundamental
mechanical principles.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,740
Major areas that we are
contributing in, one of them

41
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,620
involves the development of an
ingestible electronic device

42
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,870
that can stay in the
body for over two months

43
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,690
to release a payload.

44
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,190
That payload is
actually a bacteria

45
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,010
that can help treat
traveler's diarrhea.

46
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,950
Multiple domains are
integrated to make this work

47
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,010
in mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering, material

48
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,740
science, and synthetic biology.

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,720
Another big area is
developing devices

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,045
that enable the delivery of
drugs like insulin, but orally.

51
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:35,250

52
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,680
Beyond that, we're now
pushing that envelope

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,420
into the area of
adjustable electronics

54
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,750
and how electronics can
interface with the GI tract

55
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,670
for stimulation, but also for
sensing of different conditions.

56
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,270
As a physician, we're
extremely fortunate to be

57
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,240
able to have the opportunity
to help individuals.

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,120
As a scientist and engineer, not
only can we help individuals,

59
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,210
but we can help populations.

60
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,560
It's really about trying to
help others, including students,

61
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,819
to see that arc to help
stimulate further development--
