[Applause]

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,160
we're so honored to be part of the ILP

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,320
and the startup exchange hi everyone I'm

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,000
Katie tro Taylor CEO and co-founder of

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,960
narti AI and we're The Trusted AI

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,679
research and writing platform for

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,760
innovators we help Enterprises launch

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,160
products and discoveries to Market 20

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,920
times faster that's the kpi that we're

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,400
tracking across the Enterprises who have

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,840
adopted our technology and it's really

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,720
designed to help product and Tech teams

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,119
in R&D be able to share the technical

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,840
Nar narrative much much faster and get

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,559
through product documentation so that

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,920
they can ultimately ship better faster

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,360
products that customers

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,879
love across all of our Enterprise

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,039
engagements uh most of our users say

20
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,399
that this saves them nine hours per

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,079
person per week and when you drill down

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
and ask them well what are your people

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,079
doing to reallocate that time they say

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,320
they're spending it innovating more

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,800
strategically spending more time with

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,640
customers falling in love with the

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,920
customers problems and being able to

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,839
share the right discoveries to those

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,360
groups I want to share a little bit

30
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,479
about our journey and how we came up out

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,680
of seale here at MIT we've been uh we

32
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,799
were founded about three years ago first

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,360
concepted um as a an organization to

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,240
help use AI to support technical

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,479
documentation technical writing

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,640
especially within manufacturing and

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,600
industries where it's a major paino it's

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,280
taking up 30% of a product and R&D

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,159
professionals workday and we we had

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,079
essentially created a knowledge base of

41
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,119
narrative algorithms that were proven to

42
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,680
be more clarifying or convincing and

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,640
mapped them to different types of

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,200
product Innovation things like metaphors

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,200
are more helpful to a consumer when

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,920
they're uh when they're used to explain

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,799
a product iteration but metaphors will

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,159
absolutely leave the consumer confused

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
and baffled if you use them to

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,680
articulate a futuring

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,680
concept because of much of that research

52
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,560
and our team's background my my PhD is

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,520
in narrative science

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,439
um we were tapped by open AI really

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,200
before most folks even knew what open AI

56
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,920
was doing in their big skyscraper in San

57
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,080
Francisco and we were one of their first

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,879
seven developer ambassadors we launched

59
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,480
and built proof of concepts with our

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,480
earliest adopters um and then finally

61
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,120
launched publicly about a year and a

62
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,040
half ago and we've been growing and

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,519
scaling ever

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,440
since when we started this journey

65
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,160
because we were alive sort of before the

66
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,760
chat GPT uh user experience took the

67
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,000
World by stor we always asked how can we

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,319
embed AI into teams authoring and

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
research workflows and make their lives

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,159
easier and so we thought really outside

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,760
of a chatbot design we broke the chatbot

72
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,360
from the very start and we said why

73
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,040
don't we create an AI that prompts you

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
like a great colleague would or a great

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,560
mentor would you they ask the right

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,560
questions that's what makes an amazing

77
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,280
colleague so valuable and so narti is

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
designed to ask you the right questions

79
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,920
and help you um share your best ideas

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,080
and then it co authors those into

81
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,720
product requirements documents concept

82
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,200
notes pitches technical reports and

83
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,840
fully designed presentation

84
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,159
decks and so it's true oh I I think this

85
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,640
demo unfortunately isn't working but um

86
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,799
please do come see me and I'll be happy

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,860
to share more insight into the actual

88
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,999
technology oh there it goes never mind

89
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,999
[Music]

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,840
um we'll try one last time if not please

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,439
come see me in the expo hall oh okay

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,920
anyhow I'm happy to share more about how

93
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,680
it does that and what it looks and feels

94
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,360
like but um because we designed an AI

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,080
that prompts you uh immediately our

96
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,080
product and R&D users said well how can

97
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,599
we then do more research with this

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,120
technology so we built a research Hub

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,040
inside of narti and you can ask the AI

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,640
any research question and it will pull

101
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,360
for millions of peer-reviewed and

102
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,799
competitive gray literature and Trends

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,360
reports and it'll enable you to select

104
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,640
into those sources and build Out full

105
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,959
literature reviews and evidence tables

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,319
20 times faster than we've been able to

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,280
with human intelligence to date you can

108
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,599
also upload existing sources and API

109
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,959
into technical repositories within your

110
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,480
company safely and securely and be able

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,440
to extract out methodologies key

112
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,720
findings and even gaps in

113
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,400
Opportunities we also then created an

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,240
ability to allow you to capture stories

115
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,720
and insights at scale so in Nar ties you

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,440
can create a UR uh URL or a QR code that

117
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,600
that someone can scan if you scan this

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
actually you'll get to see what the

119
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,960
experience is like the AI starts to

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,039
prompt you and it then co-authors your

121
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,520
Innovation idea or your challenge

122
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,639
statement or your product review and

123
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,680
then as a narrati user all of those Rich

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,360
stories show up within your feed and you

125
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,759
can extract insights across them or use

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,039
them for your Innovation efforts and

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,880
this is really where we're growing and

128
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,360
scaling we're about to announce another

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,800
raise uh in October and I'm so proud of

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,160
our team for achieving this next

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Milestone and our journey and we're

132
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,240
going to be able to uh not just

133
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,120
essentially build complex graph rag

134
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,039
systems that call appropriately into the

135
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,800
right Source within your company but

136
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,800
also leverage the rich real-time

137
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,039
insights that the narrati platform is

138
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,440
inspiring folks to share and build that

139
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,800
back into the core knowledge of your

140
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,600
company we've been so proud to grow in

141
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
scale within some of the world's most

142
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,039
Innovative organizations helping them

143
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,400
hypers speed best practices and

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,560
Technical communication and storytelling

145
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,000
and uh even to see some of the data

146
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,240
coming out around how this platform is

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,479
more uh is helping professionals be much

148
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,120
more effective and even though it's

149
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,919
taking maybe a second longer than their

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
use of chat GPT they're actually

151
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,800
successful in crafting Tech uh

152
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,759
technically accurate and professionally

153
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,639
appropriate Communications in the

154
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,440
platform so this is my ask for you today
