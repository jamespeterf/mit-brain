1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,000
Co um so we are um Emma Enterprise

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:12,120
machine assistant company based out of

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,639
uh Silicon Valley uh I am a Sloan 06 MBA

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,880
um and uh have spent last couple of

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,680
decades actually in executive roles at

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,960
at coinbase and and Google and other

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,359
places the company is founded by a bunch

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,119
of exg googlers and the problem we are

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,480
trying to solve is how do we improve

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:33,360
productivity in every Enterprise by

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,800
using agenti AI we started working on

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,360
agenti AI in 2023 even before the ward

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,520
was Quin right after like chat GPT came

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,440
out like late 22 we started tinkering

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,920
with it and we have built some of the

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,399
most complex agentic AI design patterns

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,399
today and we call them AI employees we

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,280
have Fortune many Fortune 500 customers

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,559
as you can see on the on the on on this

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,840
slide and uh funded by Axel uh we have

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,000
raised $62 million to in total from

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,119
various investors and very well

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,799
capitalized today I'll play a quick

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,720
video to give you an overview of of what

25
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,560
the product is what would your

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,360
organization accomplish if you could 10x

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,560
the productivity dramatically accelerate

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,520
at scale hi I'm Emma your Universal AI

employee here to help you harness the

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,360
power of a gentic AI and unlock

33
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,560
exponential

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,119
growth you can hire me in different

Enterprise from standard roles such as

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,119
sales support data and finance to

38
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,560
specialized ones deep into your

39
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,520
industry's workflows I can onboard

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,360
myself and learn from your best

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,200
employees I have a vast library of AI

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,840
agents at my disposal each helping the

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,200
excel at specific skills from writing

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Illustrated docs to validating complex

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
rules writing code and even taking

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,240
actions across

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,360
tools I use my generative workflow

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,480
engine to instantly create agentic

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,840
workflows that help me meet my

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,480
goals just give instructions like

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,640
talking to a human and I will

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,239
orchestrate multiple agents to work

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,440
together in a simple workflow creating

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,120
an agentic mesh that will act as your

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,040
new AI

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
employee my agents are powered by MF

57
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,239
Fusion a proprietary model that

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,280
integrates results from the best public

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,360
and private language models to provide

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,560
unparalleled accuracy at the lowest

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,560
cost I can easily on board any new tool

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
or knowledge base you have and can

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,959
connect to hundreds of pre-integrated

64
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,680
apps in seconds and I have been

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,840
certified in leading international

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,239
compliance standards and keep your data

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,120
secure with robust governance pii

68
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,800
masking and audit

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,879
logs I've emerged as the top performing

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,599
employee in every role I've been hiring

71
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,720
in don't just imagine what is possible

72
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,840
with 10x more productivity unlock your

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,480
organization's potential with Emma today

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,120
I can't wait to see what we can

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,120
accomplish

76
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,159
together so what we have built is this

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,400
pre-built AI employees that that work in

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,879
different functions in in an Enterprise

79
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,440
uh you just connect them to the right

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,799
tools right applications and databases

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,000
and data sources and and they quickly

82
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,959
learn based on Enterprise data uh and

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
they can based on what humans have done

84
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,720
in that role they learn from humans as

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
well and start mimicking humans in those

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,640
roles if we don't have a pre-built

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,120
employee we can just build one very very

88
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,480
quickly using our generative workflow

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,079
engine which is just a drag and drop and

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,920
actually conversationally kind of

91
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:59,519
bringing multiple agents together to um

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,280
to uh accomplish a complex task we have

93
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,680
a employees today in in three main areas

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,439
