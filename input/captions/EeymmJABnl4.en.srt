1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,359
it's great to see you all um thank you

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,160
for attending this session on space

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,880
launch and uh yeah it's always tough to

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,679
follow Dan Hastings you know I remember

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,560
Dan uh when I first came to MIT I've

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,320
been here since

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,880
1997 and uh Dan was the associate

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,359
department head he had my job and I

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,840
remember uh the open house you know

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,840
where where am I going to go where am I

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,720
going to go to grad school and Dan was

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,160
the associate Department head and talked

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,120
about the Strategic plan of the

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,480
department here and uh it was actually a

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,160
very similar speech to the one he gave

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,640
but 30 years later constellations large

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,399
scale systems a lot of the challenge a

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,399
lot of the things that at the time was

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,879
almost science fiction is really coming

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,680
to reality so it's an honor to speak to

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,559
you today my talk will follow on Dan's

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,519
remarks but I'm going to be very

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,680
narrowly focused on the launch industry

24
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,280
so what's happening because without

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,479
launching into orbit there is no space

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,360
Enterprise so the purpose of this talk

27
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,759
is to give you an update on the global

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,200
launch industry and what's been

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,640
happening there I will also say I'm the

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,600
editor-in chief of jsr the Journal of

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,240
spacecraft and Rockets which is one of

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,600
the eight journals of the aiaa so I'm

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,400
really um I have the benefit of getting

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,040
the latest research from around the

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,360
world submitted in this area so um

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,079
really have a good insight into what's

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,560
happening so let's start with a bit of

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,920
History though uh this diagram shows you

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,920
the launch history between 1957 and 2021

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,439
of course 1957 the international

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,759
geospatial year Sputnik 1 and relatively

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,719
quickly within about seven years as you

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,479
can see here we ramped up we meaning

44
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,640
globally we ramped up to about 120

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,560
launches a year and it stayed at roughly

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,920
that level of 120 launches per year

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,239
until the end of the Cold War right the

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,480
Berlin Wall came down 1989 1990 the

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,959
collapse of the Soviet Union and then

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,560
you can see about a decade of of

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,519
decrease fewer and fewer launches every

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,440
year and the ner the low point of the

53
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,840
launch industry was in about

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,040
2003 since then since then things have

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,480
been been going up quite dramatically

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,920
and um a lot of that though is driven by

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,200
the commercial uh launch industry uh the

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,519
colors show you the different propellant

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:45,440
types so liquid Ox oxygen liquid

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,760
hydrogen uh liquid oxygen kerosene rp1

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,959
rocket propellant one um nitrogen

62
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,239
tetroxide and udmh which is a form of

63
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,319
hydren liquid oxygen and methane and

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,599
then the solids of course like the space

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
shuttle and and other vehicles

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,360
and you can see on the right side which

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,239
of the vehicles use which propellant

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,519
type and you can see the different

69
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,879
propellants have have fallen in and out

70
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,319
of favor um if I could point out one of

71
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,440
them that is really on the ascent now

72
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,799
it's the use of liquid oxygen and

73
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,159
methane that is definitely the fuel of

74
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,640
the future it

75
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,480
seems okay so um that chart if you

76
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,360
notice ended in

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,040
2021 and we were basically in 202 one we

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,360
exceeded even the highest launch year

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,159
since um you know the 80s 7s and 80s

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,680
however uh things have really changed a

81
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,400
lot in the last three years um so and I

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,959
had to manually amend this chart so I'm

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,120
just going to go back and forth here

84
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,680
toggle a little bit uh last year

85
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,680
2023 was another record year for the

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,079
launch

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,319
industry and uh we were up um we had 222

88
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,400
launch attempts glob

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,840
speaking um and 210 successes so the

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,040
success rate was

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,280
94.5% we did have 11 failures launch

92
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,920
failures and one partial failure so a

93
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,239
partial failure means um you got to

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,479
space but you did not deliver the

95
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,479
satellite to the Target orbit that you

96
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,520
wanted to reach and I'm going to talk

97
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,720
more about failures and and where do

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,160
they come from and how what can we do

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,160
about the remaining launch failures I

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,759
hope you agree with me that for for most

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,039
systems if it's automobiles or airplanes

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:41,199
or trains a 95% success rate would not

103
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:44,320
be acceptable right so we are not yet uh

104
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,720
in a routine kind of operation in

105
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,360
space okay so what does it mean to get

106
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:55,000
to space so here's a a a typical launch

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,960
profile so you have uh altitude and as

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,560
many of you know the space begins at 100

109
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:07,199
kilm the Caron line um and um by by the

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,360
way uh I teach 851 16851 satellite

111
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
engineering this semester and one of the

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,800
assignments to the students was

113
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,759
calculate the Carmen line where space

114
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,199
begins from first

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,479
principles and it turns out when you do

116
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,440
that you cannot it actually depends on

117
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,800
technological assumptions the Caron line

118
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,720
is not a nature given border it depends

119
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,240
on technological assumptions it's a

120
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,479
essentially the point where um in order

121
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,560
to generate enough lift for an

122
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,919
aerodynamic vehicle you have to fly at

123
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,360
the speed of orbital velocity that's

124
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,360
kind of the transition Point anyway the

125
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,800
point is for vertical launch we have the

126
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,360
ascent we have the famous Max Q the

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,960
point of Maximum Dynamic pressure where

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,440
is that well di maximum Dynamic pressure

129
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,120
is 1 half Row the density the air time

130
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,639
velocity squared of course we know

131
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
density goes down exponentially veloc

132
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,720
vity goes up squared so there's a point

133
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,639
where that that expression is maximized

134
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,440
and it happens pretty soon after launch

135
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,680
like roughly 90 seconds after launch you

136
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,080
will hit Max Q then the ride gets

137
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,440
smoother the loads get less then you

138
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,599
have depending on the staging uh

139
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,319
different events and then eventually

140
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,639
your trajectory needs to bend over

141
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,759
because you need to achieve horizontal

142
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,280
velocity the only reason we launch

143
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,960
vertically is to get through the

144
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,639
atmosphere as as quickly as possible

145
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,479
here this is by the way the launch

146
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,199
profile for Apollo 8 which is still my

147
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,440
favorite Mission I was born in

148
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,000
1968 and this is the mission that gave

149
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,720
us the famous earthrise picture that

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,880
you've all seen right that was maybe the

151
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,400
most significant outcome of Apollo was

152
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,560
that picture or that set of pictures so

153
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,879
you saw the Saturn 5 it is right here

154
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,599
and for many years during those decades

155
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,560
that I showed you the launch industry

156
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,440
you know it was there it was kind of

157
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,919
more or less stable but there was not a

158
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,599
lot of innovation in the launch industry

159
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,240
that has changed there is a lot going on

160
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,319
in the launch industry uh both for heavy

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,599
or super heavy launchers as well as for

162
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,520
smaller launchers we'll talk about that

163
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,199
so here's a lineup of some of the launch

164
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,639
Vehicles sort of like from small medium

165
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,759
to large really large um so new Glenn

166
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,160
for example is uh under development by

167
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,440
Blue origin it hasn't flown yet but it's

168
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,560
going to happen soon I am not showing

169
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,280
you the STS and the SLS so the the

170
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,240
shuttle that was retired in 2011 and

171
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,680
then the derivative of the shuttle which

172
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,039
is the SLS rocket um but we have other

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,120
launch Vehicles so the Aran 6 which is

174
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,159
European the European launch vehicle um

175
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,240
actually a very good architecture

176
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:55,639
unfortunately a decade late Aran 6 would

177
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,720
have been a great launcher if it had had

178
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,879
its first launch in like 2013 or 2014

179
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,080
um it's not reusable in its current

180
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,560
state and then here you see the various

181
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,879
evolutions of you know bfr which became

182
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,520
Starship today so I want to uh because

183
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,879
this is such a Monumental uh was such a

184
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,240
Monumental event and I'm sure many of

185
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,159
you have seen bits and pieces of it I

186
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,680
wanted to take just those three minutes

187
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,199
to show you the launch video of the last

188
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,280
flight the last uh test flight number

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,479
five for Starship um and then I'll I'll

190
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,639
I'll I'll tell you what's the connection

191
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,639

CH this is absolutely insan on the first

219
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,399
ever attempt we have successfully caught

220
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,399

[Music]

230
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,399
all right so um how exciting is that so

231
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,040
what's the MIT connection well many of

232
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,920
our our graduate students um and some

233
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,560
undergrads too of course who are working

234
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,959
on Starship are graduates of our

235
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,760
department um for example the lead

236
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,839
engineer who is responsible for the

237
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,199
flight back booster control Lars

238
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:31,480
Blackmore uh graduated from a asro and

239
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,279
here's some more recent example so matoz

240
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,320
did not work on Starship but he was the

241
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,320
Arian 6 system engineering um lead for

242
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,120
the requirements Katie Carroll uh

243
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,000
graduated in 2021 with her Masters she's

244
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,279
in charge of mission integration for

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,440
Falcon 9 and then Matthew maragas uh

246
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,480
Masters 2018 and PhD 2021 is a member of

247
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,279
the propulsion engineering team for

248
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,959
Starship that you just saw um so let me

249
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,480
talk a little bit about the fundamentals

250
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,399
here here so the fundamentals really of

251
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Rocket Theory um date back to constanti

252
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,760
silovsky um it's one of the basic

253
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,160
equations that we all need to teach and

254
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,199
learn and uh 1903 is when he published

255
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,440
that and one of the key questions is how

256
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,920
much fuel do we have to burn to

257
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,880
accelerate accelerate a rocket from some

258
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,240
initial velocity to a known final

259
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,760
velocity and uh and this is essentially

260
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,760
this is an MIT conference so I got to

261
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,639
show you some equations right uh so this

262
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,240
is this is a one of the forms of the

263
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,199
rocket equation uh that's the one that

264
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,839
tells you the final mass of the rocket

265
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,240
so after a burn what is the mass of the

266
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,160
rocket well it is the um it's a function

267
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,759
of the initial Mass Delta V which is the

268
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,800
change in velocity this is the idealized

269
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,279
rocket equation by the way um so it does

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,680
not account for drag for example it does

271
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,040
not account for it's basic basically in

272
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,800
vacuum uh doesn't account for Gravity

273
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,720
losses so the Delta V velocity change um

274
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,519
Earth

275
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,120
gravity um and then ISP which is the

276
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,720
specific impulse so how much Delta V is

277
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,519
really required to reach orbit it's

278
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,040
quite a bit um so orbital velocity is

279
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,000
about 7.8 km/s but then we have to

280
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,839
compensate for uh the gravity losses so

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,399
when the rocket ascends like you saw on

282
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,639
the video right we we're fighting

283
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,959
gravity in a vertical sense and that's

284
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,160
not helping us achieve orbital velocity

285
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,880
so every second that the booster thrusts

286
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,839
in the vertical direction is a loss when

287
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,040
it comes to achieving orbital velocity

288
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,000
which has to be horizontal and then of

289
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,040
course we have drag losses as we go

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,199
through the atmosphere so all in all uh

291
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,839
that's about another 2 km/s so if if you

292
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,720
want a rough estimate it's kind of a

293
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,639
generous estimate of of how much

294
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,759
velocity change we need to achieve it's

295
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:06,399
about 10 kilm per second which is a lot

296
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:09,120
now um what does it mean to be an orbit

297
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,839
it's all about energy it's all about

298
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,199
energy so let's assume we're we're we're

299
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,240
basically entering an orbit uh a

300
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,720
circular orbit around the Earth uh the

301
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,720
height of our altitude of our orbit is H

302
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,759
and this would be the velocity of our

303
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,920
orbit so it's the square root of mu the

304
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,120
specific gravitational parameter divided

305
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,759
by r and then you can see as R increases

306
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,040
as you go further and further from the

307
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,319
earth your orbital velocity actually

308
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,199
goes down that's counterintuitive right

309
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:43,360
we go further away from the earth and

310
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:45,600
our velocity drops but the total energy

311
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,639
increases and why is that because our

312
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,560
potential energy increases and so this

313
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,560
equation on the upper right this is a

314
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,720
very famous equation it's the key

315
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,839
equation to understanding everything

316
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,759
about being in orbit maneuvering an

317
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,480
orbit refueling an orbit this is the key

318
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
equation it's called the VIS Viva

319
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,680
equation and shows you the energy

320
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,079
density or the specific energy in Jewels

321
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,720
per kilogram of an object in a circular

322
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,639
orbit or an elliptical orbit if you look

323
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,920
at minus mu/ 2 a a is the semi- major

324
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,360
axis of the orbit so um we we can plug

325
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,720
in different numbers for different

326
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,519
orbits if we could orbit the

327
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,720
earth um at the surface of the Earth

328
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,880
which we can't because of the atmosphere

329
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,120
we we would need about 7.9 km/s at a 500

330
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,360
km orbit which is um about where

331
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,720
starlink satellites operate they're at

332
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,120
550 it's 7.6 and then at geosynchronous

333
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,440
it's about 3

334
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,399
km/s why am i showing you that I'm

335
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,279
showing you that because we can

336
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,759
calculate the energy per unit mass that

337
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,360
we need to put into a body so that it

338
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,279
can orbit the earth so we can plug in

339
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,839
those numbers and you and and we get a

340
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:05,760
number of about 33 megga per kilogram 33

341
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,640
megga per kilogram the bigger part of

342
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,760
that is the ktic energy but the

343
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,039
potential energy is is is about 15% of

344
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,880
that so it's it's also significant so no

345
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,880
matter how you launch into space with a

346
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,600
rocket with a rail gun uh maybe with a

347
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,199
space elevator in the future this is the

348
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,079
amount of energy you're going to have to

349
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,840
provide that's a that's a universal law

350
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,720
where's that energy coming from so this

351
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:38,000
diagram shows you um the density uh by

352
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,640
volume and by by mass so the orbital

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,480
energy is shown here that's that

354
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,160
vertical line that I showed you 33 megga

355
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,760
per kilogram so ideally we want to use a

356
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,880
source of energy to the right of that

357
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:56,320
like jet fuel rp1 right um kerosene

358
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,039
highly refined kerosine or methane LG

359
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,320
liquid natural gas the biggest component

360
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,240
of that is methane that's what Starship

361
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,919
used uses that you just saw in the video

362
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,799
or in the lower right hydrogen the issue

363
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,360
with hydrogen is it gives us the best

364
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,200
rocket performance but it's also very

365
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,360
very volatile right and and if we have

366
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
it as a cryogenic fluid we do need to

367
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,120
deal with the boil off so you can only

368
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,600
really uh fuel the rocket uh minutes or

369
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,559
a couple hours before the launch so uh

370
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,919
those are the choices and

371
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,200
you saw in the video the staging why is

372
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,480
staging so important staging is so

373
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,760
important achieving single stage to

374
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,840
orbit SST launch it's been a dream for

375
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,360
many years we've had programs trying to

376
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,400
achieve single stage to orbit and

377
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,400
Recovery the problem with it is the mass

378
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,480
fractions that we would have to achieve

379
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,799
are still Out Of Reach therefore uh we

380
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,120
do staging and um I'm not going to show

381
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:59,159
you I'm not we're not going to go

382
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,440
through this in detail but there's some

383
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,559
really interesting numbers here to look

384
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,919
at so gamma for example that's the mass

385
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,840
ratio of the the payload Mass plus the

386
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,880
structural Mass fraction Alpha times the

387
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,200
amount of fuel you carry for example for

388
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,120
a single stage to orbit and then this

389
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,960
parameter beta which is essentially how

390
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,200
much propellant do you put into the

391
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,559
second stage relative to the first stage

392
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,720
so we can work through the math and

393
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,400
convince ourselves that staging is

394
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,799
really worth it

395
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,240
and it comes down to essentially proving

396
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:38,039
that this inequality here is true when

397
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,039
is it true well it turns out it's it's

398
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:44,960
always true um and how much benefit

399
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,720
really is there to staging and so here's

400
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,960
a a worked out example assuming that our

401
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,000
rocket is a uh 1 million kilogram that's

402
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,720
actually less than Saturn 5 Saturn 5 was

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,320
about 3 million kilograms Starship is

404
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,280
about 5 million kilograms but it's sort

405
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,600
of the same class of launch Vehicles so

406
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,799
we're going to keep the total launch

407
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,559
Mass the same and then compare our

408
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,360
single stage to our two-stage rocket and

409
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:13,919
the answer is the payload Advantage is

410
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:17,760
very significant in this case it's about

411
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,400
60% um and so we cannot do launch

412
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,440
without staging either two stages or

413
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,440
three stages then the benefit of adding

414
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,360
additional stages decreases so you get a

415
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,320
sense that designing launch Vehicles is

416
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,679
a real mdo problem multidisciplinary

417
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,440
design optimization we had actually

418
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,720
worked on this as an mdo problem many

419
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,360
years ago so you can see in this DSM all

420
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,559
the disciplines that are coupled the

421
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,480
aerodynamics the trajectory the

422
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,520
propellant selection the structural

423
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,039
design uh the cost as well and

424
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,520
everything is really kind of intimately

425
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,520
connected at the time we had predicted

426
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,280
that um the cost for launch so this is

427
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,720
cost to Launch

428
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:06,320
versus the payload launched so the two

429
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,880
here indicates 20 metric tons that you

430
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,240
couldn't do better than this blue line

431
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,240
which is optimized Rockets with genetic

432
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:18,960
algorithms kind of a precursor to

433
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,960
Ai and uh lo and behold the Falcon 9

434
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,039
beat our original estimate from 10 years

435
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,120
earlier you see it's it's below the line

436
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,840
so you can launch more with the same

437
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,000
budget or you can launch uh cheaper with

438
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:37,799
the same uh payload launch uh Target how

439
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,480
is that possible how is that possible

440
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,360
the simple answer is reusability

441
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,919
reusability we did not assume

442
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,559
reusability back in the original design

443
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,000
problem reusability is really the key

444
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:52,000
and it's interesting when you look at

445
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,600
the evolution of Falcon 9 so the version

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,679
1.0 of falcon9 which was the 2010

447
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,600
version and then the version

448
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,919
1.1 uh they were very close to that blue

449
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,320
parito line that we had predicted but

450
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,039
then ft which is the current full thrust

451
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,480
version of Falcon 9 beat that estimate

452
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,159
so here's Falcon 9 here are the specs

453
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,799
for Falcon 9 and we look at beta that

454
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:20,120
parameter beta that you saw uh it's

455
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:23,039
almost exactly a 3.9 almost 4:1 ratio so

456
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,600
the point is an optimal design of a

457
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,720
rocket use it but it will also change by

458
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,520
fuel type is for the the booster is four

459
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,320
times larger than the second stage or

460
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,840
the upper stage so this all makes sense

461
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,880
now Dan Hastings alluded to this um what

462
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,039
about emissions what about the

463
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,600
environmental concerns so you saw that

464
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,720
this is what a typical launch trajectory

465
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,039
looks like and we're becoming more aware

466
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,360
of the various forms of impact so local

467
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:57,960
impact so the local dust cloud um the

468
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,320
ground Cloud the plume through the uh

469
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,080
tropis spere and then the stratosphere

470
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,880
and then eventually bending over the

471
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,520
recovery of the the various stages and

472
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,279
uh even later on Rocket stages

473
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,799
re-entering much later rocket stages

474
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:17,880
re-entering much later uh also causing

475
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:22,039
uh emissions uh and and different

476
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,640
alumina and other um substances entering

477
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,400
uh the mesopause and the stratosphere

478
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,080
and there's this is actually an area of

479
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,240
very active research including

480
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,480
atmosphere chemists as well um so the

481
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:38,120
environmental impact of the launch

482
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,440
industry is uh becoming more um more

483
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,039
important and there are of course people

484
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,320
who will say it's such a small industry

485
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,080
it's not significant uh it's already

486
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,120
hard enough to send things up there

487
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,880
let's not worry about it and that's

488
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,039
exactly what people used to say about

489
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,480
the automotive industry that's exactly

490
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,880
what people used to say about the

491
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,000
airplane you know the aviation industry

492
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,360
so we believe now is the right time to

493
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,840
really think about sustainability even

494
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,480
for the launch industry and if you think

495
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,720
this is just sort of hypothetical I

496
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,360
pulled out this this is a new story from

497
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,039
the New York Times

498
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,039
today not like six months ago this is a

499
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,080
new story today in New York Times um

500
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,039
that launch that you saw on the video

501
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,960
there was an independent researcher that

502
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,520
measured the sound levels and they

503
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,880
exceeded by quite a bit what had been

504
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:33,080
advertised so the the local impacts of

505
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,399
um of these launches particularly for

506
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,960
Starship uh are quite significant and it

507
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,600
comes back to the question that Dan

508
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,799
Hastings said about regulation you know

509
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,159
we don't want to ground Starship because

510
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,520
it exceeded sound levels but we do want

511
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,480
to deal with it in an honest and uh

512
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,720
productive way uh the launch failures I

513
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,600
mentioned they still occur uh here's

514
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
some different so Falcon 9 of course

515
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,840
during its development had some launch

516
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,080
failures uh the Russians

517
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,360
um proton M this is a 2013 launch

518
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,240
failure and then more recently the teron

519
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,520
one launch failure in 2023 some of you

520
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,880
might know Teran um relativity space is

521
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,600
a very Innovative space company most of

522
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,399
the components on that launch vehicle

523
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,039
are 3D printed but they did not succeed

524
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:22,520
in that particular launch so why do we

525
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,520
care of course crew and payload safety

526
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,080
Mission success advancing the technology

527
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,760
and enabling

528
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,480
reusability and so

529
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,720
um so here's an analysis that we

530
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,480
recently published at the IAC conference

531
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,279
in Milan a few weeks ago on all the

532
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,320
launch failures that have occurred that

533
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:48,000
we know about um in in the last 20 years

534
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,360
and by country and also by subsystem and

535
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,600
so uh so here's by country and then

536
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,880
here's by

537
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,679
subsystem and so in total we have had

538
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,760
118 launch failures over the last 20

539
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,760
years

540
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,640
about half of them are due as you would

541
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,159
expect to the propulsion system so

542
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,880
that's your uh your turbo pumps your

543
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:13,960
nozzles um your gas generators and so

544
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,600
forth uh about 4% software failures uh

545
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,919
guidance navigation and control about

546
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,480
88.5% electrical structural separation

547
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,480
failures about

548
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,200
6.8% and then

549
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,320
unspecified uh where you know the launch

550
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,919
the launch reason has the the failure

551
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,480
reason has either not been published uh

552
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:35,559
or or it's unknown is about a quarter so

553
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,480
a quarter of launch failures are not

554
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,080
well understood and we're happy to share

555
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,360
that very recent paper with you on

556
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,200
launch analysis so in order to really

557
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,520
understand launch failures and even

558
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,320
partial failures you have to be able to

559
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,480
simulate these trajectories and so here

560
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,840
you can see an actual Falcon 9 uh launch

561
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,320
data uh the the blue curve is the

562
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,360
velocity so you see the first stage

563
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,919
stage separation second stage and then

564
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,640
the more noisy uh orange curve is the

565
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,600
acceleration profile and so we have the

566
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,039
ability to really simulate these

567
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,080
launches in six degrees of freedom quite

568
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,279
accurately and then inject synthetically

569
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,640
inject different failures and see

570
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,399
whether they match the predictions so

571
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,559
that's another area of Interest so let

572
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:26,600
me finish up by talking about launch

573
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,360
services and and figures of Merit this

574
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,000
is a list of how do we judge the quality

575
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,360
and also the the competitiveness of the

576
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,640
launch industry of course launch cost uh

577
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,399
uh then we have launch the success rate

578
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,200
that we've talked about uh improving

579
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,720
safety the launch Cadence launch rate

580
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,440
per year you've seen that's going up my

581
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,600
prediction is that by 2027 so three

582
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,279
years from now we're going to launch to

583
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,679
space every day you know we're at 220 is

584
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:59,600
launch attempts 3 years from now will

585
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,760
probably be around 4 00 so we'll launch

586
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,840
to space every day from somewhere on

587
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,200
Earth in about 3 years um and then of

588
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,279
course the payload needs an interesting

589
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,120
question is small launchers dedicated

590
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:15,880
small launchers versus uh launching

591
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,039
small satellites as secondary payloads

592
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,840
on the larger launches um the secondary

593
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,080
payloads it's a much cheaper proposition

594
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,000
the downside is you get not to you do

595
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,120
not get to choose your your target

596
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,600
destination orbit you have to go to the

597
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,919
the orbit of your primary payload uh

598
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,720
what about launch costs a lot of has has

599
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,399
been said a lot has been

600
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,200
promised um and uh I would say that

601
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,440
we've really improved a lot thanks to

602
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:47,240
Falcon 9 uh and SpaceX but also others

603
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,320
uh but not as much as was claimed so

604
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,240
this comparison this is a comparison of

605
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,600
the launch cost pre-ot which is uh

606
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,519
NASA's commercial space Transportation

607
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,840
Services resupplying of the ISS we're

608
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:03,679
definitely below $10,000 per kilogram uh

609
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,440
Falcon heavy is is if you fully utilize

610
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,840
that launch vehicle it's closer to

611
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,360
$2,000 per kilogram

612
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,320
today um this is just from a US

613
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,159
perspective active and plant launchers

614
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,760
we made this chart uh a couple years ago

615
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:23,679
for NASA's space um new space economy

616
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,440
office and I just wanted to update you

617
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,720
in red with what's the latest status so

618
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,399
Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy very

619
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,760
successful they've had over 400 launches

620
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:37,519
to date Starship as you saw has had five

621
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,320
test launches the sixth launch probably

622
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:44,080
next week um new Shepard is a suborbital

623
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,519
vehicle continues to operate new Glenn

624
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,640
we've been waiting for new Glenn uh

625
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,000
patiently and it looks like it is going

626
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:56,240
to have its first launch within the next

627
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:01,120
couple months um the SLS of course um

628
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,880
the SLS is uh a sore topic uh but it it

629
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,480
continues to exist as a program we'll

630
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,200
see in the in the new Congress now uh

631
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,559
whether SLS will continue or not uh

632
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,279
Delta 4 heavy has been retired it had

633
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,519
its last launch in April uh Atlas 5 a

634
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,919
very reliable launch vehicle um is still

635
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,600
active but also nearing retirement

636
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,080
Vulcan had its first launch this year in

637
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,640
January of

638
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,440
2024 um and then we have a couple of

639
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,760
smaller launchers that either were

640
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,840
cancelled or uh companies that went

641
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,120
bankrupt like virgin orbit uh launcher

642
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,799
one was a air launched rocket so we have

643
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,960
a real mix here of of success stories

644
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:45,080
and much less success as well last year

645
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,640
I showed this chart uh Promises by Ula

646
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,840
to launch Vulcan Promises by the

647
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,960
European Space Agency to launch Arian 6

648
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,679
did it

649
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,840
happen yes it did yes it did so Vulcan

650
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:03,039
Vulcan had its first launch on January

651
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:06,240
8th and uh and Arian 6 on July 9th so

652
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,519
you can see that 2024 was a really big

653
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,159
year in this

654
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,000
industry um and so the newest trend is

655
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,559
dedicated small launchers there's a lot

656
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,240
of companies competing in that my

657
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:20,919
personal opinion is uh El the electron

658
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,200
launch vehicle by rocket lab is probably

659
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,240
the most successful of all of them and

660
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,919
you can look at the price point here

661
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,639
$7.5 million for a launch that's about

662
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,080
uh 10% of what a falcon 9 launch costs

663
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:39,279
but of course the payload is much less

664
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,000
uh the payload is 300 kg to lth orbit

665
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,399
and then about 200 to SSO which is a sun

666
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,120
synchronous orbit but definitely a very

667
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,320
impressive small launcher company uh

668
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,360
they're also by the way uh developing a

669
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,279
launch port in the US now in Virginia

670
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,559
and this is my final chart I said a lot

671
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,880
about the US I didn't say a lot about

672
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,720
the global picture but here's the global

673
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:06,399
picture for 2023 by space port um so if

674
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,880
it was really a a a two-party race

675
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,320
essentially uh during the Cold War it

676
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,600
looks like a two-party race today China

677
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,559
has really impressively increased its

678
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,919
launch Cadence they have six launch

679
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:23,080
sites in China and achieved about uh 70

680
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,200
or so launches last year uh the blue bar

681
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,960
on the other side here is the us we also

682
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,279
have six launch ports I don't know if

683
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,600
you knew that but uh there's the Kennedy

684
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,519
Space Center Cape Canaveral Mars is wops

685
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,320
Island in Virginia psca is actually a

686
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,840
launchport in Alaska um and star base is

687
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,760
bokach chica in Texas and then

688
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,080
vandenbberg in California and of course

689
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,600
a lot of other countries are also

690
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,120
developing their launch capabilities uh

691
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,519
some of them like France have been

692
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,120
around for a long time but are really

693
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,519
very down in terms of launch rates and

694
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,240
then we have some new nations joining as

695
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,559
well so um it's it's a very exciting

696
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,440
time and I don't know if we have time

697
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:08,000
for questions do we have time okay so

698
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,080
thank you very much and I hope that was

699
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,080
a clear picture thank

700
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,440
you I think the gentleman back

701
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,880
to some of the ballistic or kinetic or

702
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,240
however you call them launch platforms

703
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,080
like spin launch and the rail guns where

704
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,320
do you think they play in this are you

705
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,880
positive negative ambivalent I have to

706
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,480
be careful how I respond to that uh SP I

707
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,159
actually am quite familiar with spin

708
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,559
launch because um they um you know they

709
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,360
received several Investments they've

710
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:56,799
really done some impressive work on uh

711
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,279
what you could say is like the first

712
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,519
stage right

713
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,799
the problem is the energetics when you

714
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,240
go back to that vva equation and you

715
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,399
actually plug in the numbers even a very

716
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,159
high uh initial launch velocity but you

717
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,320
you're doing it uh on the surface of the

718
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,839
Earth the the actual energy that you add

719
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,760
to that object uh is is still a pretty

720
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:22,440
small fraction to orbital velocity so

721
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,599
you still you still need a lot of extra

722
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,639
Delta V to get to orbit even with spin

723
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,879
launch and then at that point you have

724
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,839
to say what's more econ economical a

725
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,200
maintenance of a spin launch

726
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:38,159
facility or uh for example air launching

727
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,159
so then it becomes a bit of an economic

728
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,560
argument other questions comments yes

729
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,560
the gentleman here in the

730
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,440
front hi my name is Jean phip Nikolai

731
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,000
from France but I just have a question

732
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,119
um I remember long time ago maybe 20

733
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,800
years ago there were a lot of uh there

734
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:05,119
were launches launch pad in the on the

735
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,720
sea is it still operating or is it um is

736
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,520
it there was a commercial there was sea

737
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,440
launch right which was a commercial

738
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,200
company operating off the coast of

739
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,160
California off of Long Beach uh

740
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,359
launching I believe the zenet rocket

741
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,680
they are no longer in operation but

742
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,839
China actually has um I think it's the

743
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,119
Yellow Sea if you see this Yellow Sea uh

744
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,359
launch site that is actually sea launch

745
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,359
so the Chinese are doing it but the US

746
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,520
is no longer doing it and I think it

747
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:37,599
comes down to this economic argument you

748
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,920
know maintaining a um the the advantage

749
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,920
of sea launch is you can go exactly to

750
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,160
the latitude you want for example

751
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,359
equatorial you get the maximum Delta V

752
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,079
but uh the weather dependence the cost

753
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:54,280
of maintaining the ship uh the whole

754
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,359
logistical cost is quite significant and

755
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,079
so it's not clear to me that sea launch

756
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:01,560
is really worth it in general maybe for

757
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:05,000
specific applications but as a general

758
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,000
strategy probably

759
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,720
not Ron no question from you I'm

760
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,720
disappointed my question

761
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,800
answer any more

762
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,119
question hi Winston churn for exite um

763
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,520
thank you for the presentation it was

764
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,319
very nice uh quick question um I noticed

765
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,560
that you plotted uh cost per launch

766
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:37,720
versus um per kilo versus time do you

767
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,839
expect that Trend to continue to drop

768
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,839
over time and is there any physical

769
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:46,000
limitation to when that might stop and

770
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,079
you know how would that otherwise impact

771
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,880
you know kind of policy going forward

772
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,880
that's a great question so the question

773
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,319
was will the launch cost uh dollars per

774
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,920
kilogram continue to decrease I do

775
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:00,119
expect it will decrease um especially

776
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,960
once Starship becomes operational right

777
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:06,520
Starship has a capacity of over 100

778
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,599
metric tons the question is it's a

779
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,280
little bit like the A380 you know the

780
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,359
A380 is a great airplane but you have to

781
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,119
fill the airplane you have to get 500

782
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:19,400
people to buy tickets and and and sit in

783
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,079
the A380 to really make it economically

784
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,680
viable so if you have a 100 metric tonon

785
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,160
launch vehicle but uh On Any Given

786
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,160
launch only 60 or 70 of those metric

787
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,240
tons are actually used there's unused

788
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,440
capacity right in that launcher um so

789
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,680
we'll see I mean Starship definitely is

790
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,599
a GameChanger but uh filling up Starship

791
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,560
launch after launch once it's

792
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:49,280
operational is is going to be tricky so

793
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,960
to me is a similar situation to the A380

794
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,800
but I do expect it to continue to

795
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,040
decrease there probably is a lower ASM

796
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,079
toote first of all the cost of the fuel

797
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,920
itself which isn't very much

798
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,280
but the cost of the labor force that it

799
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,480
takes to operate the whole system and

800
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,319
then even if you can reuse that booster

801
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,359
stage uh 20 times or 30 times you still

802
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,359
have the turnaround cost the inspection

803
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:15,640
cost so there's there is a a lower

804
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,800
asmode what exactly that is I don't

805
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,359
think we know but it's it's most

806
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,760
certainly below

807
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,760
$1,000 uh per

808
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,400
kilogram ah there we go well you

809
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,160
challenged me all every time you give a

810
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,920
talk you show one of these equations and

811
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,640
I feel like I'm back in unified so thank

812
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,920
you for turning the clock back to 1983

813
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,319
you mentioned that SLS you think has an

814
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,240
uncertain future could you elaborate on

815
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:46,319
that a little bit and maybe comment on

816
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,319
the implications of a potential

817
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:51,280
cancellation um well this is a public

818
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:54,079
forum so I have to be a little careful

819
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,119
but I I do think this is an instance

820
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,040
where the election outcome actually

821
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,400
makes a difference

822
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,119
um as you know Elon Musk uh is going to

823
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,040
be part it looks like at least

824
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,200
informally of the next

825
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:12,400
Administration and um he and others have

826
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:14,960
been extremely critical of um the SLS I

827
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,440
mean the estimate is that a single SLS

828
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:22,160
launch costs about $1.5

829
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,960
billion um a falcon 9 the regular Falcon

830
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,839
9 not the Falcon 9 heavy is about $60

831
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,599
million so you can you can buy you can

832
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,319
pay for about

833
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,000
255 Falcon 9 launches for a single the

834
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:37,000
cost of a single SLS now the SLS is

835
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,040
human

836
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,400
rated um and it provides a lot of jobs

837
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,200
you know in certain States and that's

838
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,880
been the Congressional mandate for SLS

839
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,520
the mandated reuse of the uh rs25 you

840
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,640
know the space shuttle main engine the

841
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,800
mandated reuse of the um solid rocket

842
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,480
boosters uh that's that's really a

843
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,040
congressional mandate uh I could I could

844
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,480
imagine that Congress and its new

845
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:08,240
configuration plus you know the exe

846
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,040
executive branch will say um the three

847
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,040
or four billion dollars per year that

848
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,240
we're spending on SLS is not worth it

849
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,319
we're going to invest that in a

850
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,800
different launch vehicle I don't know

851
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,520
that that will happen but I think it's

852
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,760
much more likely now than it was a month

853
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,880
ago and I'm happy to if someone

854
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,560
disagrees with that statement I'm happy

855
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,560
to debate that that with you uh off

856
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,680
stage sorry thank you a great talk by

857
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,960
the way so there's been talk about

858
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,680
increasing um kinetic Space Warfare of

859
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,400
various forms taking out satellite

860
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,760
systems and those sorts of things which

861
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,520
suggests that there might be a need for

862
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,440
surge launch capacity to replace assets

863
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,359
that have been rried what's your sense

864
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,920
about where we are on surge capacity wow

865
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,000
that's a great uh that's a great

866
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,400
question uh there have been five

867
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,160
anti-satellite tests so far performed by

868
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,480
the way we the United States were the

869
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,319
first to perform anti-satellite tests so

870
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,440
we should just acknowledge that so there

871
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,319
have been five so far and um they're not

872
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,960
a good thing they're not a good thing

873
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,400
you can see the step function in the

874
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,599
orbital population after each of those

875
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,040
tests so uh for the record uh we should

876
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,400
be banning anti-satellite

877
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:32,200
tests you know similar to a nuclear uh

878
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,280
treaty nuclear test band treaty I think

879
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,560
it's it to me it's on the same in the

880
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,920
same category uh that being said um we

881
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,400
actually had a a doctoral thesis on uh

882
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,040
gain theory in space recently that that

883
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,640
was concluded happy to share that with

884
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,880
you

885
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,520
and and you can play out different

886
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,839
scenarios and it's really interesting it

887
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,920
comes down if there really is

888
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:58,319
large-scale conflict in space a lot of

889
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,839
it will come down to replacement

890
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,359
capacity how quickly can we replace

891
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,079
these failed satellites uh which means

892
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,960
do we have the launch sites do we the

893
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:09,440
have the launch Vehicles do we have the

894
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,720
satellite manufacturing capacity to

895
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,400
rapidly replace these uh defunct

896
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,119
satellites and it really reminds you of

897
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,280
World War II World War I right how

898
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,319
quickly can we make airplanes tanks and

899
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,839
so forth I mean I hate to bring it up

900
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:26,319
but I think the industrial capacity in

901
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,920
the future to launch and replace

902
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,920
satellites rapidly is going to be very

903
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,640
important okay thank you Professor okay

904
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,640
thank you

905
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,960
[Applause]
