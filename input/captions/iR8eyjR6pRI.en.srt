CRA good

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,159
afternoon the last session is us the

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,720
hardest uh you have listened to the

19
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,439
whole day seminar and learn a lot of

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,759
things but you still

21
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,360
are here and in Thailand people always

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,200
say that people still here at the last

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,200
session are the true

24
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,840
love you must be real fan of AI who

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,560
would like to understand more and in

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:52,880
fact we have learned a

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:55,920
lot Professor have talked about AI is

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,680
everywhere in fact there has been some

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,920
mention about um AI winter but the more

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,439
I listen today the more I feel that it's

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,399
not AI winter that is coming it's more

32
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,520
like AI Golden Age there will be so many

33
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:16,200
opportunities available and in fact this

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,160
is probably very early part of the whole

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,720
thing I think um there are so many

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,800
things that can be done like noat just

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,040
mentioned before we are at the beginning

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,840
of the most important

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,080
transformation that we are facing

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,160
so basically

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,599
today we will definitely get the last

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,959
panel Who coming from both the business

43
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,440
Academia and also from the government

44
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:51,560
segment to talk and discuss exactly what

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,519
can we do to really fast forward the AI

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,920
implementation in especially in Thailand

47
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,400
I think the more you listen you are

48
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,959
having the same question that what is

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,319
the opport for Thailand can this thing

50
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:09,519
happen in this country and what can be

51
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:14,040
done right so today we will would like

52
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,720
to talk to the four distinguished

53
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,000
panelist I probably would like to do in

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,200
two round um uh we'll

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,319
be on some question that we are

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,879
preparing and then the last 20 minute

57
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,560
will probably be in question and answer

58
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,080
in the first round we will ask question

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,760
on the use case I mean what are the use

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,200
case in Thailand we have listened in the

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:46,840
morning on blockchain in term of GTM in

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:53,239
term of um

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:55,519
the AI and also in term of customer

64
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,280
services but we also would like to know

65
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,480
how company in Thailand have adopted AI

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,599
into their operations

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,400
and at the same time we would also would

68
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,360
like

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,799
to talk about the

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,760
challenges what are the challenges

71
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:17,280
preventing us adopting Ai and finally on

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,880
the question of incentive what kind of

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,919
incentive what kind of infrastructure

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,960
that we can put in place to making sure

75
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,560
that AI prosper in Thailand and finally

76
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,720
if we have some time we will talk about

77
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,960
the consequences there are some

78
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,840
consequences that we have to deal with

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:41,680
especially people who become unemployed

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:45,000
and also in term of um the ethical and

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,919
equality questions so basically let's

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,400
manage this in um for row of questions

83
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:55,840
and uh that we we are

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:00,400
planning now um let me begin from the

85
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:06,160
business side um I would like to ask

86
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:10,120
Dr Nat on um from through on what is the

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,440
use case of AI in your

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,560
organization thank you very much thanks

89
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,639
thanks to uh allow me to be here um I

90
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,639
think we we let me categorize it in

91
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,520
three ways one is the direct Service uh

92
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,280
to the customers uh second is um you

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,880
know our own efficiency the business

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,680
efficiency and third one is the customer

95
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,120
understanding so direct uh Service

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,080
Direct product and service would

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,960
certainly include the customer

98
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,639
interaction call center automation I'm

99
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,319
not just talking about customer talking

100
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,039
to chatbot which may not be satisfactory

101
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,400
to everyone but right now customer

102
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,199
service people are using AI as their

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,319
Helper because phone's coming out all

104
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,240
the time every month every day and um

105
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,600
they lose track of all the details

106
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,440
instruction for each phones so when

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,600
customer calls in asking the details of

108
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,880
the phones and and how they use um they

109
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,919
can use AI as their helpers so that's

110
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,440
very real very practical ways of of

111
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,599
using it right now without sacrificing

112
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,160
the direct experience of customers

113
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,160
talking to people um that's the Direct

114
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,039
Customer uh impact um company efficiency

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,240
business efficiency we are using them on

116
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:29,039
the smart Telecom Network um Telecom

117
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:32,840
network using a lot of uh Power and um

118
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:36,639
AI help our Telecom Tower reduce power

119
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,560
usage they know in what time what angle

120
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,479
of uh the tower protected to the

121
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,919
community which angle have low load you

122
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,680
know at what time and they can kind of

123
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,440
customize that based on based on the the

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,639
uh actual load the third one um let me

125
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,919
just take the example of uh customer

126
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,319
understanding right um data uh we are

127
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:02,599
using data to understand 300

128
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:05,759
360° um customer knowledge um so to

129
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:09,160
offer a credit line to customers to do a

130
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,400
credit uh scoring for the customer and

131
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,560
also to collaborate with our uh business

132
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,400
partners to create that understanding of

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,440
customer so that we can you know upsell

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,720
or help customer personalize their you

135
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,360
know their content consumption things

136
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,199
like that that that is uh we are using

137
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,800
some of those for uh our u customer

138
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,080
understanding oh let me just mentioned

139
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,479
the last one um for for True uh we are

140
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,039
also building um AI compute

141
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,759
infrastructure so we are have we we are

142
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:46,919
facing um you know opportunity and also

143
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:49,800
challenges to equip our um data center

144
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:54,319
to accommodating the the the water cool

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:58,120
liquid cool um ships um such as Nvidia

146
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,080
for example um that that would be a a

147
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,000
huge investment

148
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,599
and and I might touch on that a little

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,720
bit more in in the incentive question

150
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:11,520
thank you thank you um let me move on

151
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,800
toak from cbx um on the use case of AI

152
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
in your

153
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,080
organization um I guess um SBX as you

154
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,800
know is a financial institution right um

155
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
and financial institution Financial

156
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,120
Services is known as one of the areas

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,879
where AI is actually quite primed to uh

158
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,000
to transform but on the sort of

159
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,599
perspective of of how AI will be used I

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,200
I guess I have a I have a little bit of

161
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,000
mixed feeling right I I I am optimistic

162
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,440
hopeful but at the same time very

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,160
concerned about how a will be used and

164
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,160
you know the impact and elaborate the

165
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,760
use cases uh much similar to K I think

166
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,959
we we trying to incorporate AI into

167
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,200
every part of the um the business from

168
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,480
decision- making data driven insights

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,160
you know help identify New Opportunities

170
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,959
manage a risk uh as any banks would do

171
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,680
uh improve the customer service you know

172
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,120
shorten the time to Market reduce the

173
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,680
cost all these things are uh in fact are

174
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,000
happening and we even set the target for

175
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,640
for the group right we say that 75% of

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,079
our businesses should be enabled by AI

177
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,760
in some way shape or form in three years

178
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,760
and that there's some clear measures

179
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,320
around that there's some some examples

180
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,760
of how how we're using um a couple of

181
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,160
examples right uh right now when you

182
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,720
when we um one of the concern as being a

183
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,839
bank is that we heavily regulated and

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,320
every time our sales agent try to do

185
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,640
something or try to sell a product there

186
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
a there's a thing called Market conduct

187
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,279
the bank of Thailand would actually

188
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,680
govern that essentially you need to say

189
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,480
certain things right in the past what

190
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,279
happened is that uh you know there'll be

191
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,079
mystery shopping right some people will

192
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,959
go and try to uh pretend to be customer

193
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:57,079
and see what the sales agent is actually

194
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,880
saying according to the script or not

195
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,680
the the way to do that is highly labor

196
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,160
intensive right mystery shopping and you

197
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,920
only do sampling so right now with with

198
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,240
AI right with the collaboration within

199
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,120
the group we actually uh designed using

200
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
language model uh and all these things

201
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,079
that you're familiar with to essentially

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,720
do a realtime uh transcript of what the

203
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:19,079
agent has said and right then and there

204
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,360
you can actually send out an email

205
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,760
whether you've actually completed

206
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,480
according to what you should say and it

207
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,000
it takes quite a bit of compute

208
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,440
resources and uh you know kind of the

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,079
the algorithm behind as some of you who

210
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,200
familiar with would would know right so

211
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,200
that that is a you know qu kind of one

212
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,800
good use that we're using there are a

213
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
few more use cases but the the reason

214
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,639
why I'm concerned that I mentioned is

215
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,480
that it it certainly feel that for our

216
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,760
organization uh we feel that we actually

217
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,639
doing a lot right but we barely

218
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
scratching the surface and every time

219
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,200
when you in the morning when you get up

220
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,279
you hear about new invention new AI

221
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,880
coming out and you can't help but feel

222
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,079
that you're actually uh falling behind

223
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,800
right in that sense and it's actually

224
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,399
quite challenging because

225
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,480
in a way for for it to happen our

226
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,880
current infrastructure and processes are

227
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,040
I would say analog right a lot of human

228
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,279
involvement and AI feeds on digital

229
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,360
infrastructure and companies like ours

230
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:18,160
even they considered relatively advanced

231
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,600
in in many areas still very much um sort

232
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,839
of got slowed down by that right and

233
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,440
there s the thing around data that

234
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,000
everyone essentially AI need to have

235
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,320
data and and the the quality and the

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,760
quantity of data is actually also a CH

237
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,880
CH I'll you know I I'll say something

238
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,720
that perhaps I shouldn't be saying but

239
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,959
I'll say it anyway you know a customer

240
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,959
who is actually holding a multiple

241
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,519
products within the organization because

242
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,959
they run by different business units

243
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,360
sometimes you don't even know that they

244
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,160
are actually the same Customer because

245
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,040
the customer ID is different and before

246
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,480
you know it the customer 360 that could

247
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,000
not is talking about is a Holy Grail

248
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,000
that we're trying to do it takes a lot

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,720
of time to even try to clean up that

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,480
kind of data and if you think about it

251
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,120
even step one is so difficult in that

252
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,880
sense right and you have a lot of

253
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,959
Promise around AI coming out which we

254
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,320
are very excited about and we're trying

255
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,000
to we have tens of use cases actually

256
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,720
rolling around and within the

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
organization but at the same time I

258
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,560
think it's it's the rating is so

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,560
organization and we touch on the human

260
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,639
capital later on in terms of the riness

261
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,160
other the people right in the end I

262
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,320
think uh this is where an area where as

263
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,959
a company as a country I think we can

264
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,720
use AI to Leap Frog uh where we are

265
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,399
today but you got to do it right and you

266
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,720
have to um sort of plan it and it's not

267
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,320
just going to happen by just seeing the

268
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,199
examples elsewhere and trying to imagine

269
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,519
that it could happen in your

270
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,639
organization you actually need to do a

271
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,560
lot of ground work uh behind the scene

272
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,519
and that's something that um you know we

273
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,279
are excited by but like I said also

274
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,399
concerned if we're not uh putting the

275
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,399
right infrastructure in

276
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:56,480
places thank you in fact I also come

277
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,240
from banking business also I can confirm

278
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,880
what could arak have said we we failed

279
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,560
the same way we just scratching the

280
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,839
surface so many more thing to be done

281
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,600
and in fact a lot of a lot of our

282
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,320
customer now U using the interaction

283
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,519
through the mobile banking almost 90%

284
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,199
that's very very much lending itself to

285
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,839
the AI um technology that we can help to

286
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:25,959
service the client more now let me turn

287
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,399
on to Professor crimson's um we have

288
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,800
listened the whole day in fact on the

289
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,880
use cases

290
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,920
from the business segment and in fact

291
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:38,760
now two more from Thailand um I would

292
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,440
like to ask you I mean we have seen a

293
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:46,240
lot of Advance a lot of thinking in the

294
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,880
University level um but how can Academia

295
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,040
and business can work together to bring

296
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,480
about the implementation of AI better

297
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:59,360
from the idea from the University into

298
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,240
the business from your experience please

299
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,680
I love getting easy questions um but

300
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,680
it's an important question and I'm going

301
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,800
to highlight two places where I think

302
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,839
Academia can can

303
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,560
help one

304
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,120
is there are lots of academics that take

305
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,199
on interesting problems and their goal

306
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,199
is to write a great paper helps you get

307
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,120
promoted but I think the real Advantage

308
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,880
is to take on problems where you not

309
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,800
only solve the problem but you think

310
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,720
about the impact as my colleagues know

311
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,079
I'm it 's mission statement says we

312
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,240
educate students we create knowledge and

313
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,959
we apply that knowledge to the great

314
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,240
challenges of the nation and the world

315
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,600
and so I think universities not just MIT

316
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,440
but other universities really ought to

317
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,360
think

318
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,800
about not just tackling new problems not

319
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,720
just coming up with new Solutions but

320
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,800
hearing from the potential place where

321
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,759
there's the impact of so what is the

322
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,639
real need um you know what's the thing

323
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,680
that you really need to make this go and

324
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,920
I think if I look at experiences from

325
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,639
MIT I think the opportunity for Thailand

326
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,560
is to help identify unique opportunities

327
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,639
here where you could use help from

328
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,160
Academia to think about Solutions we've

329
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,079
seen that with interactions with other

330
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,800
countries where it's something specific

331
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,680
to that situation that really makes

332
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,759
things interesting so it's a high level

333
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,720
answer but I think many of my colleagues

334
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:29,240
at MIT are interested in understanding

335
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,920
specific problems here where our

336
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,720
if you like our experience in creating

337
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,079
Solutions can work with colleagues in

338
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,880
business here um to try and find ways to

339
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,160
find

340
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,079
Solutions I think the second place if I

341
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,000
can really quickly we've talked about it

342
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,839
during the day I think upskilling is a

343
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,199
real challenge for companies jobs are

344
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,800
going to change um you've got employees

345
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,279
that are no longer going to be able to

346
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,880
do the things they did in the past and

347
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,040
how do you help them deal with that and

348
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,560
I think universities have an opportunity

349
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,120
to create educational experiences that

350
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,360
aren't just the traditional MIT class

351
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,399
but they're aimed at helping deal with

352
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,240
upskilling and for that we need help

353
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,240
from industry to understand so what is

354
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,600
the new rule going to be you know a

355
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,360
worker that's I'm going to use if I may

356
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,399
the banking example I'm sure you have

357
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,440
employees that are um you know

358
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,880
traditional tellers traditional

359
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,680
accountants those are going to change

360
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,240
help us understand what the new jobs

361
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,800
will look like and then how can we help

362
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,959
do the upskilling to make it happen but

363
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,160
I think upskilling is real challenge for

364
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:35,199
AI is it changes the job situation

365
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,279
Academia has a role to play in trying to

366
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,319
help adapt to

367
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,480
that I I think our our accountant will

368
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:46,880
be G will be gone very

369
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,279
soon and but but then but then can you

370
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:54,360
give us some more example where MIT have

371
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,240
been working with business in term of um

372
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,440
helping with AI projects or how can you

373
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,039
collaborate

374
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,799
so we can see more and

375
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:09,039
clearer so unfortunately the examples I

376
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,799
think of are less focused on business my

377
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,199
colleagues can probably do a better job

378
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,280
of that but I think there are great

379
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,120
examples of

380
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,039
MIT interacting with companies to think

381
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,079
about how to use the new tools to create

382
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,079
new opportunities so I'll I'll give you

383
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,000
just one example I don't mean to isolate

384
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,840
it but it's one that I know MIT has a

385
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,400
partnership with IB m u IBM in fact

386
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,280
moved its Walt its Watson health unit to

387
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,039
Cambridge in order to be close to MIT

388
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,799
and we have a series of projects where

389
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,720
MIT researchers and IBM researchers get

390
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,280
together every year to propose a problem

391
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,080
and to find places where there's an

392
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,720
overlap and then to work jointly to come

393
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,160
up with Solutions so I'm hesitating

394
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,559
because it's not a solution to a

395
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,000
business problem but it's a solution to

396
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:01,039
new opportunities in business it's a

397
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,679
5-year project IBM is very happy with it

398
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,320
um and um you know we're continuing to

399
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,039
use it I said one I'll give you a second

400
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,600
one quickly um MIT has a partnership

401
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,760
with teada the um the teada the the what

402
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,320
the I think of it as a Japanese although

403
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,960
it's International but a but a a an

404
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,440
international if you like um

405
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,880
pharmaceutical company and again what we

406
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,120
do is we have MIT researchers talk with

407
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,159
teada researchers where the teada folks

408
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,360
provide input on specific problems of

409
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,440
interest to them and then they partner

410
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,640
with MIT researchers to come up with

411
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,799
projects that we'll try and find

412
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,679
solutions to it so they're generic

413
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,640
examples but they are really places

414
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,919
where the business is providing input on

415
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,799
specific challenges and they're finding

416
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,919
MIT colleagues to come up with Solutions

417
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,919
thank you we we definitely looking

418
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,240
forward to working with MIT on some of

419
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,919
these problem uh I I bet that there will

420
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,799
be a lot of business who would like to

421
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:07,360
work with MIT now let me turn on to

422
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:11,159
katai katai come from our government

423
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:15,000
agency DEA um which is support digital

424
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:18,600
economy in Thailand um what is your view

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,840
on AI um this application of new

426
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,080
technology artificial intelligence in

427
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,000
business uh what is the stance of the

428
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,720
government how you look at

429
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,200
it okay thank you kapan um I would like

430
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,880
i' like to um give my recognition to Dr

431
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,480
vet as well he has founded Deepa the

432
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,559
organization where came from your boss

433
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,840
my my boss um well um The Stance of the

434
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:48,159
government I think has been far beyond

435
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:52,159
the the the boom of AI um in recent

436
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:57,440
years uh we have the national AI um

437
00:19:52,159 --> 00:20:01,200
master plan which spans from 2021 to

438
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,760
2027 so sixe spans um in that spans we

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,440
focus on two phases of uh the

440
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,640
development the very first phas will be

441
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:14,400
the fundamental aspect of it uh which is

442
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:17,200
the um the data Covance the um the

443
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,600
framework the participation from the

444
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:27,000
public and private Partnerships and um

445
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:29,840
all that uh we are drafting uh laws Al B

446
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,039
it will be uh quite slow um um in

447
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,240
drafting the law in Thailand but um

448
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:38,640
there are two laws involved in AI which

449
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:43,360
is the AI business laws and AI um

450
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,120
promoting uh promotion act uh well why

451
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,559
that is being delayed I think it's a

452
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:53,400
good sign um that um the Pioneer in uh

453
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,039
developing or uh uh implementing the AI

454
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,640
technology we have some head start on

455
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:02,000
that because uh the laws can sometimes

456
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,799
times uh uh shoulder you with like some

457
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,320
of the weight that you have to take care

458
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,159
um a little bit extra carefully um and

459
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,880
also uh besides the law that is being

460
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,760
delayed um there are the guidelines that

461
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,279
um Eda uh another agency is uh uh

462
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,520
putting up the framework uh which is the

463
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,880
AI governance Center uh this Center is

464
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,200
uh responsible for giving consultation

465
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,159
to public and private um sectors to like

466
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,919
who would like to implement the AI

467
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,559
projects so it it are it is a very good

468
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,880
foundation that we have to work with but

469
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,039
um on the second phase uh which is like

470
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,080
starting very soon will be the expanding

471
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:49,400
the research expanding uh the

472
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,480
applications that AI has to offer across

473
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,320
various um sectors in Thailand um and

474
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,159
and in Thailand there are a few um

475
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:02,880
prominent um verticals that we can uh

476
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:06,000
have a very good and uh extensive data

477
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,200
from uh first one being tourism the

478
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,640
second one uh being the healthcare and

479
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,960
the third one being agriculture which I

480
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,720
think uh we can we can explore more in

481
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,520
the in more interactive rounds but um

482
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,720
from uh Professor Grimson said the

483
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,520
upskilling the workers the workforce uh

484
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,880
it is exactly what um Deepa has been

485
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,440
tasking to do um we are proposing to the

486
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,640
government and get the the the approval

487
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,799
of having the the tax deduction for the

488
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,279
corporates who would like to upscaling

489
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,760
their Workforce so the corporate income

490
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:46,760
tax will be deductible up to 250% of the

491
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,640
expense and for the people without uh

492
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,799
like who works in freelance without um

493
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,200
uh uh organization they can enjoy up to

494
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,559
150% of personal income tax so um if

495
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,720
that skill um matches the the road map

496
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,840
that we are putting in forth um they are

497
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,360
entitled to that tax

498
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,440
benefit thank you seem like the

499
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,720
government is now preparing a lot of

500
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,000
support um let me turn to kunak on the

501
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,480
question of

502
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,720
challenges I think along the way that

503
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,840
you try to implement AI um AI adoption

504
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,240
there there will be a lot of challenges

505
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,480
uh can you share with us exactly what

506
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,440
are the challenges that you are facing

507
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:35,360
so far and I will turn to goodat to

508
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,840
later on please so I I I would say that

509
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,120
if you know in the spirit of um I guess

510
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,240
being analytical that I would say the

511
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,760
way the four things that we need to put

512
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,279
in place to get the the impact right one

513
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,600
is essentially the the AI the model

514
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,400
itself uh second one is the

515
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,279
infrastructure underneath that you can

516
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,240
actually run uh the AI on top the

517
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,159
processes and everything right the third

518
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,159
one is the data and the fourth one is

519
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,159
the human you know it used to be very

520
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,559
difficult to actually uh we used to

521
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,520
operate under the assumption that you

522
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,000
know we have data we and not we don't

523
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,080
have good algorithm we can't run the

524
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,080
model so on and so forth with AI with

525
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,760
Gen coming out I think that first parted

526
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,440
equation is actually considered solved

527
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,320
and is it's actually uh becoming an

528
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,279
issue where you ride on the global

529
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,960
capabilities coming out from open AI

530
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,520
coming out from a lot of places where

531
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,000
you you feel that okay at least the

532
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,159
algorithm part they brain the AI part

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,279
you you you you have it

534
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,159
right the the the other three though

535
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,760
remains a challenge right uh the

536
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:35,760
infrastructure I mentioned in the

537
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,760
previous

538
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,039
discussion uh the systems are still not

539
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,799
100% digital and when it's not digital

540
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,840
there's disruption it's very difficult

541
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,120
to actually deploy uh meaningful

542
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,039
processes uh AI enable processes

543
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,000
optimization on top so that's that's one

544
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,279
thing that we need to fix and the longer

545
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,559
the oranization in our organization

546
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:58,080
turning 118 years this year so you can

547
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,919
imagine the kind of and Bangkok Bank is

548
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,880
also

549
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,440
not doing so differently in that sense

550
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,640
uh we have quite a bit of Legacy

551
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,919
processes and system so I think those uh

552
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,080
probably can appreciate that uh data uh

553
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,159
mentioned the quality and quantity

554
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,679
that's actually quite uh quite difficult

555
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,240
but I think the last one which is the

556
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,480
human is the one that actually I foresee

557
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,120
to be the the most difficult one it's

558
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,039
not so much in the past we were

559
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,600
concerned about how many data scientist

560
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,080
we would have and you know things of

561
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,159
that nature because we're worried about

562
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,600
the algorithms right but right now I

563
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,039
think think is more of the broader

564
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,080
Workforce are you able to uh you know

565
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:38,120
kind of fully Leverage What AI has to

566
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,039
offer is becoming a question of can you

567
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,679
develop the new skills for the future uh

568
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,880
the skills that you know around asking

569
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,840
the right questions having the

570
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,760
creativity and having imagination to ask

571
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,760
the AI to do something which is

572
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,360
unfortunately the the skill that that

573
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,600
critical thinking that creativity is

574
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,960
something that's actually unfortunately

575
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,640
lacking quite a bit in in in Thailand

576
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,880
and perhaps in other part of the world

577
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,320
so where I I think this is uh when we

578
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,399
need to invest a lot of time and

579
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,559
resources I'm glad that GBA is actually

580
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,880
having when when is that the tax coming

581
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:12,360
out that would be good it's coming up

582
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,840
okay good so 250% I I take note um the

583
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,640
you know because I I I'll give you

584
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,279
examples of how we we think about we

585
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,399
have what we call AI literacy program

586
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:23,840
where you know for we aim 100% of our

587
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:26,120
employees need to actually have basic

588
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,640
rudimentary AI skills and not to say

589
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,840
they can program right they need to know

590
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,880
what it is what it can do what it cannot

591
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,720
do how to use it you know so on and so

592
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,600
forth so everyone has to kind of know it

593
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,760
the same way they use computer in that

594
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,799
sense but the the next one is the one

595
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,480
where we talk about you need to actually

596
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,600
process abilities to interact and use AI

597
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,360
this is a low code no code type of uh uh

598
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,440
access you'll be able to fully leverage

599
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,080
whatever is solutions that out there and

600
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,240
the last uh much smaller percentage is

601
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,320
in uh research and development where we

602
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,440
need to actually uh Advance the skills

603
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,120
at one point we need to actually have

604
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,399
our own each company I believe you need

605
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,880
to actually have your own competitive

606
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,440
advantage and you need to actually

607
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,320
develop that from the ground up right

608
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,360
and we have actually a few two team

609
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,399
members uh sitting in this room as well

610
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,080
from R&D where they focus on building

611
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,799
that advanced skills so I would say uh

612
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,799
to make the impact in the long run it

613
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,880
starts from The Human Side of Things

614
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,279
where the the tools the capability that

615
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,600
the brain I think you will catch up it

616
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:28,840
will become more of a commodity product

617
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,000
but the people who's actually using it

618
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,159
is the one that I think will will proven

619
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,279
to be um the biggest challenge that we

620
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:37,520
need to

621
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:39,600
overcome thank you Dr not come from

622
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,519
another industry do you have the same

623
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,960
challenges or a different one please

624
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:48,279
very much the same I I think um I Echo

625
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:53,399
every Point um that arak said um you

626
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:55,960
know data um algorithm um and compute U

627
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:59,840
infrastructure and um I just want to add

628
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,399
maybe some ankles to the data um more

629
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,799
and more data cannot be just internal

630
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:09,279
data it it has to be collaborate uh with

631
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:12,600
outside organization or even public um

632
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:16,440
organization or public data um how to do

633
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:20,600
that while um uh respecting the the

634
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:24,760
privacy and anonymizing the data It's

635
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:27,279
Tricky right to say the least I think um

636
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,279
how we can do that that I think in at

637
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:35,039
least in my view that is still a

638
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:38,080
struggle um but if the customer uh um uh

639
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,919
can benefit from from doing that I think

640
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,799
uh the industry is is you know basically

641
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,000
going that way right but how to do it uh

642
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,080
while keeping that respecting that uh

643
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,799
right I think I think that is something

644
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,919
that we need to maybe put our heads

645
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,480
together and try to to crack that maybe

646
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,679
there's some best practice out there um

647
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,760
but but that that's one ankle that um

648
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,760
that's a challenge the second one I

649
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,559
think the compute side um we are still

650
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,480
quite you know very slow in in in that

651
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,880
in that side in Thailand um we have yet

652
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,600
to have a lot of compute um

653
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,240
infrastructure for for AI training and

654
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,559
influence and uh when right right now

655
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,679
while we are using the regional um

656
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,840
infrastructure it's very expensive it's

657
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,120
very expensive for training and for for

658
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,559
actual use so having a local computer

659
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,039
infrastructure is one of the most

660
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:35,679
important uh um element um and one of

661
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:40,159
the key uh uh driving force for that is

662
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,320
is the power um it's power cost uh to

663
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,799
the infrastructure because

664
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,360
infrastructure use a lot of uh Power

665
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:48,840
that would be something that we also

666
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,919
need to to to crack uh before we we

667
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,559
getting more and more um compute coming

668
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,440
from whether it's from Nvidia by

669
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,240
themselves or they're going through

670
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,240
hyperscalers you know and other AI uh

671
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,000
Compu infrastructure that that's going

672
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:07,960
to be a challenge for

673
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,679
us um I we we listened from two business

674
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,799
already they have very similar problem

675
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,840
uh what are the main Challenge from the

676
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,240
government point of view in adopting AI

677
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,000
what what you feel that that is need to

678
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,720
be done the obstacle from preventing

679
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,559
business in Thailand really move toward

680
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,080
more AI adoption in Thailand well uh the

681
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,559
challenge just for the private sectors

682
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,320
um to to adopt AI would be the the

683
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:39,840
workforce probably number one because AI

684
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,559
is changing um every night um every

685
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,640
morning we wake up we have a new

686
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,960
technology coming up um so um that's a

687
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,279
part that the upscaling is the of the

688
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,919
utmost uh importance um the second one

689
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:56,679
would be the data um I agree with Dr n

690
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,799
that U the data from one Corporation or

691
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:04,120
one organization alone probably not be

692
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:07,080
able to train uh decent AI um of today

693
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,440
um just forget about the future but um

694
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,679
we will need to find the framework for

695
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,679
the government data to uh desensi uh Des

696
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,039
sensitiv um all the data um remove all

697
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,600
the sensitive items um and then share it

698
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:26,639
with the the

699
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,880
organization um that probably be the way

700
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:33,080
that we have to with we have to crack it

701
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,679
and work it to to uh together to to to

702
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:39,840
train a better AI for tomorrow and one

703
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:43,159
area that we need to focus on is um

704
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,440
thees because um everyone here is coming

705
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,639
from the very big corporations and thees

706
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,919
the small and medium Enterprises are the

707
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:53,679
one that uh probably get trapped into

708
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,880
this U technology Gap um and the

709
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,799
government will have to find a way to

710
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:03,600
subsidize um to be able to um allow

711
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:07,159
thees to access the AI with the tools at

712
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,200
the reduced cost to help uh I think

713
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:14,399
sharing some of the burden of upfront uh

714
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,799
investment fores so I think the money is

715
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,159
probably be the very very important

716
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,720
thing and the people

717
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,760
drak thank you I want to turn to

718
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,559
Professor Grimson um how about your

719
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,159
experience I mean what are the

720
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,159
challenges in other countries Now you

721
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,200
listen to type person three already

722
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,279
right what are the challenges that you

723
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,840
have seen in other country that prevent

724
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:40,320
adoption of AI and then um we would like

725
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,279
to also come back to the question of

726
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,919
reskilling the workforce preparation

727
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,760
please I love I love being the last

728
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,080
person in the group because all the good

729
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,279
answers have been given so I'm just

730
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,279
going to I'm just going to highlight

731
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,559
them I totally agree on data and I would

732
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,440
add to it and I think it's it's you know

733
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,440
implicit in what you said

734
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,320
it's making sure that the data is of

735
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,919
high quality dealing with bias in the

736
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,720
data is really important uh in order to

737
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,480
um make sure that you're training a

738
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,880
system in a way that is actually going

739
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,919
to be valuable and I appreciate the

740
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,440
answer from the government perspective I

741
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,080
totally agree with you that one of the

742
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,360
worries I have about the data is small

743
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,240
and medium-sized Enterprises may not

744
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,000
have access to it you can already see

745
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,840
this in the US right I mean a Microsoft

746
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,480
and Amazon and Google can really

747
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,120
dominate in this space because they've

748
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,279
got massive amounts of data and open AI

749
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,360
has has done that well so I think the

750
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,240
idea of a government thinking about how

751
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,000
to make that data accessible to other

752
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,679
partners really is crucial so I think

753
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,279
data is really important and bias and

754
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,760
data I think is is really important um

755
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,200
one of the places where I think Academia

756
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,240
can help with a challenge we've talked a

757
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,720
little bit about um upskilling workers I

758
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,320
do think that's an important part

759
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,200
but I think there's another opportunity

760
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,760
maybe a little smaller but I still think

761
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,280
really important how do you get an

762
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,800
employee in a company to actually trust

763
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,800
the answer that the AI system comes up

764
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,480
with um and sorry what I'll point back

765
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,399
to the study I mentioned earlier the

766
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,639
Sloan study that showed that when users

767
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:25,079
were using

768
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:29,240
gp4 um they their performance on a task

769
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:31,359
that gp4 did well improved by using it

770
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,919
if they were using gp4 and they had a

771
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,679
guide on how to use it it improved

772
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:37,839
either more but when the task was

773
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,720
something that was not well suited to a

774
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,040
large language model their performance

775
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,040
declined because they didn't question it

776
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,520
oh it's an AI system has got to be doing

777
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,679
the right thing so point of this is I

778
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,679
think Academia can help by providing

779
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,599
training components that help people

780
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,320
decide when has this passed the smell

781
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,760
test the smoke test when do you really

782
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,920
want us to decide to use it that will

783
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,839
improve the the incorporation of AI into

784
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,720
system but when it comes up with a

785
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,200
really bad answer and it changes what a

786
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,520
company does it's not good so I think

787
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,040
that's a challenge is how do you decide

788
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,240
how to evaluate the performance of the

789
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,359
system and I think Academia can help

790
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:24,680
provide things in that space But but you

791
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:28,520
also mentioned early in the day about um

792
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,040
education for K12 I think that also will

793
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:35,200
be interesting thing to to to talk about

794
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,240
because in fact AI can be trained early

795
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,520
on in life so people become more AI

796
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,320
literate and then be able to adapt it

797
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,599
later on can you can you give us some

798
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,800
more example and understanding yeah I I

799
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,960
think K12 is a place where um Academia

800
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,800
can actually have an impact I'll give

801
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,640
you a very specific example it's just an

802
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,880
example I have a colleague um in open

803
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,040
learning um faculty member in media lab

804
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,000
Cynthia Brazil who's created a program

805
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,599
called day of AI and the idea of day of

806
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,280
AI is they create curricular material

807
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,680
four different versions one one aimed at

808
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,720
elementary school students one aimed at

809
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,200
middle school students two aimed at high

810
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,040
school students one for students that

811
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,680
are stem oriented one for students that

812
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,480
are not a lot of hands-on experience but

813
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,480
the idea of day of AI is it's a day in

814
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,760
which teachers with help from these

815
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,640
materials can talk to those students

816
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,520
about so what is it how's it going to

817
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,760
change your experience when you graduate

818
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,160
and if you're an elementary school

819
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,119
student that's 10 years now it's going

820
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,319
to change it a lot um what can it do

821
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:51,359
what can it not do Dave of AI last year

822
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:54,280
had um schools from a 100 different

823
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:57,839
countries with several hundred, school

824
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,599
students impacted in terms of getting

825
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,160
that sense of experience now that's a

826
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,319
day it's not changed the curriculum but

827
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,200
it's a valuable way to actually think

828
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:09,240
about getting students to think about

829
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,040
this I think on top of that we can build

830
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,280
curricular material that actually can be

831
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,119
used by school teachers um to

832
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,760
encorporate into other kinds of classes

833
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,480
and I know it's not related to this

834
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,560
topic but by the way having done day of

835
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,760
AI we're in the process of doing day of

836
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,640
climate with the same idea how do we get

837
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,200
young students to understand the impact

838
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,680
of climate change the impact of

839
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,359
sustainability as we deal with

840
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,040
it University professors are probably

841
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,520
not the best people to create curricular

842
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,160
material for for younger children but we

843
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,720
can partner with people to create those

844
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,760
pieces and I do think there's an

845
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,680
opportunity for us to actually change

846
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,680
K12

847
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:58,440
y I cannot

848
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,760
resist I I remember when I went to it

849
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,960
there was away a picture of student

850
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,119
sitting under the fire host and then

851
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,960
learning from the

852
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,800
professor so you DP so many idea and

853
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,920
then we have to learn quickly and I'm

854
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,560
thinking MIT Professor teaching

855
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,480
elementary school so we have to training

856
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,400
very hard okay but but but you really

857
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,599
think that we should begin from early

858
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,000
age not not just um 18 years old 16

859
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,560
years old so

860
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,920
as early as possible on AI I

861
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,400
think so if you don't know the comment

862
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,480
the comment is getting an education in

863
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,520
MIT is like trying to tr trying to take

864
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,520
a drink from a fire hose uh you can

865
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,640
imagine how painful that is uh

866
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,839
and so to that point I think MIT and

867
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,160
other places need to work with education

868
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,800
experts to understand the level at which

869
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,920
you can do that but to your question I

870
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,359
actually think that it would be very

871
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,440
valuable to introduce simple concepts of

872
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,960
AI to first graders to second graders

873
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,000
there are things that they can

874
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,960
understand um they're not well I was

875
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,640
going to say they're not going to

876
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,200
program we have occasionally people who

877
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,640
show up at MIT who have been programming

878
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,920
since they were six but I think we can

879
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,319
have impact on very young children to

880
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,520
think about what is AI what does it do

881
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:25,280
when should I trust it and how is it

882
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,599
going to change my experience moving

883
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,960
forward yes I think we should thank you

884
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,119
I think I think um now we probably have

885
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,720
a new generation they said generation

886
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,760
beta but I think it's probably

887
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,079
generation AI um that all the kid have

888
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,800
to learn and then live with AI since

889
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:44,560
early age and then the more time passed

890
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,880
by AI will become even more importance

891
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,680
now let me turn to the last round of

892
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,119
question on the incentive what what can

893
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:57,480
we do I think everyone who in this room

894
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,119
probably feel that so many opportunities

895
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,000
so many thing to be done so many things

896
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,240
to be captured but how can Thailand

897
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,599
become the leader in this field right I

898
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,839
think um many country have been

899
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,760
progressing very well in in the area of

900
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,880
AI what can we do together to really put

901
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,440
Thailand on that map I now I would like

902
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,960
to begin from Kai first uh let's give

903
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,079
the government um the first comment on

904
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,000
what can the government do to to Really

905
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,280
create the right ecosystem for AI to

906
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,240
prosper in Thailand Okay um apart from

907
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,240
the upscaling um package that we

908
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,160
prepared um I believe the government uh

909
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,160
by the board of Investments have already

910
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,599
introduced the package I think way

911
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,839
before like maybe seven eight years ago

912
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,359
about um AI being included into the A1

913
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,720
package A1 package means the highest

914
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,839
incentives that um any Corporation will

915
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,800
get whether it be the um investment from

916
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,800
abroad or within the

917
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:07,000
country um A1 package allows you to uh

918
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,880
have up to 13 years of tax holiday with

919
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,400
no cap so um there's no tax for you for

920
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,520
like 13 years and if you are in um the

921
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,680
specific areas for for example eec or in

922
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,960
the special economic zones uh that the

923
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,839
government's announced um you be

924
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,520
entitled for another five years of 50%

925
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:30,160
corporate income tax so that is a I

926
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,160
believe it's it's very generous package

927
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,440
and for the eec package itself um if you

928
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,079
have experts coming in to Thailand and

929
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:44,040
worked in uh let's say the eec area um

930
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,359
that expert is entitled for 177% flat

931
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,119
rate of personal income tax so it's

932
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:51,200
going to match the neighboring uh tax uh

933
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,560
benefit from from our neighboring um

934
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,640
countries so that's a tax incentives um

935
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,480
not just only those two that I have

936
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,480
mentioned um there are several more um

937
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,440
for the usage of the package as well the

938
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:07,040
government is also giving the grants um

939
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,720
and also with the matching funds for

940
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,440
example if a company is investing in Ai

941
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,480
and uh the company think it's going to

942
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,680
be eligible for for the matching fund

943
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:24,920
they can apply for the fund uh for up to

944
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:27,200
um 50 million B per

945
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,400
company okay and that is through the

946
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,640
competitive funds that has set up since

947
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,760
um uh former cabinets so it's 20 billion

948
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,839
BS funds that are sitting there and

949
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,400
waiting for uh companies to like have

950
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,720
cool projects to come in and claim that

951
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,720
uh that fund and also the government has

952
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:51,960
uh the cloud first policy um which is uh

953
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,119
implementing but uh we are seeing some

954
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,480
of the uh use case from the government

955
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,280
from the public sectors uh utilizing the

956
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:05,359
data and with the AI coming in so um the

957
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,599
cloud first policy will uh probably help

958
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:12,200
speed speed up the the transformation to

959
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:14,280
AI uh with within the public sector and

960
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:19,720
we have the digital skill road map uh

961
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:23,559
that uh we set up a list of uh courses

962
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:26,760
and syllabuses that uh we we would like

963
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:29,440
uh the corporations and thees to to to

964
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,960
look at and if it matches some of the

965
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,400
skill set that the corporations would

966
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,040
like to uh Empower their Workforce then

967
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,119
it's entitled to the tax benefit as well

968
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,760
so that'll be four of these okay I I

969
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,720
want to turn to Professor first um what

970
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,400
kind of policies that government can put

971
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:53,960
in place to really Foster AI I mean um

972
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,559
in other countries that you have seen

973
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,480
sorry say again um what kind what what

974
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,760
are the set of policy measures that the

975
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,280
government can put in place to in

976
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,280
incentivize the adoption of

977
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:12,000
AI and then I will turn toak and then

978
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,160
now so I have more time to think about

979
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,160
but

980
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,720
just so I I think first of all I mean

981
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,640
I'm struggling because I don't know the

982
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,240
tie system well no but in in other

983
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,640
country not no need for Thailand or

984
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,079
maybe in America I mean what what do

985
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,000
what do they do that we can learn from

986
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,559
them I mean what what is the role of the

987
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,319
government in the AI adoption yeah so I

988
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,960
think three comments two of them I think

989
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,960
we've already heard I think this idea of

990
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,480
encouraging upskilling is really

991
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,400
valuable I think this idea of providing

992
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,680
incentives for for companies to move

993
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,839
forward I I think is really valuable I

994
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,359
think the third place where I the

995
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,839
government can work with business and

996
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:58,200
Academia but especially with business to

997
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,319
really encourage AI

998
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,960
is to think about the safeguards on the

999
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,960
regulatory side of um when is a product

1000
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,760
safe to be used what are the standards

1001
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,440
that a product needs to demonstrate

1002
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,280
before you you decide that and I said it

1003
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,760
earlier in the day I look at what the EU

1004
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,480
has done and think it's a really good

1005
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,720
start it's not perfect but it's a good

1006
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,280
start on saying for these kinds of

1007
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,839
products here's the level of concern for

1008
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,839
these kinds of products here's a higher

1009
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,160
level of concern so I think to the

1010
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:30,880
extent that government can work with

1011
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,319
businesses together to say here are the

1012
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,760
regulatory issues here are the

1013
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,359
safeguards in use that will make it

1014
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,000
it'll help users accept it more readily

1015
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:42,680
of saying yes this is something I trust

1016
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,359
to use and it'll protect the businesses

1017
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,960
from um you know if you have that

1018
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,359
disaster if you've met the regulations

1019
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,359
hopefully you've got some protection

1020
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,240
around it as opposed to if there are

1021
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,400
none and I would say as a last comment

1022
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,440
you know in the US I think the major

1023
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,040
companies started this Microsoft

1024
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,040
partnered up with with Amazon with

1025
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,160
Google with Facebook to say what are the

1026
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,720
initial levels of performance that we

1027
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,839
need how do we get that into regulation

1028
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,760
I think that's a place where it can

1029
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,960
really help that's very insightful um

1030
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,559
now let me turn to uh Dr n first I mean

1031
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,800
you have listened to K chai already

1032
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:21,760
proposing what the government can do do

1033
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,070
you feel it's enough I mean do you want

1034
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,440
something

1035
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,559
[Laughter]

1036
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:30,200
more okay you can choose me which one go

1037
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:34,319
first um okay um I think certainly

1038
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,680
incentive to upscale is very important

1039
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,400
um and and we looking forward to to work

1040
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:43,359
as a PPP as well um there's a lot of

1041
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,000
tremendous opportunity for uh to to do

1042
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,760
PPP in a certain pilot zone for educa

1043
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,920
specifically for education for example

1044
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:56,119
uh which is the right formula um I'm in

1045
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,839
connect ed uh program which BBL also

1046
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,680
part of of many organization here also

1047
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:05,559
part of where it's PPP between um um

1048
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:10,839
Ministry of Education um corporations

1049
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:13,559
and also um the um schools um work

1050
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:16,480
together some of the projects or

1051
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:20,680
districts that implemented uh create

1052
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,640
their own type of upscaling it is

1053
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,839
Grassroots and that kind of various

1054
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,200
projects that free form project was

1055
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:33,000
created some are effective some is not

1056
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,240
but it's excellent to be able to free up

1057
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,559
the imagination and see which project

1058
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,760
Direction approach it's working so when

1059
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,200
when we funding this type of

1060
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,920
upscaling uh I think uh the the the

1061
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:51,720
Forum where we allow creativity for for

1062
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,800
for this type of format I think that's

1063
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,480
important on funding certainly

1064
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,640
corporates uh wants to uh wants to help

1065
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,880
as well

1066
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:04,240
uh not just to train the students but

1067
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,960
also to uh helpme adopting AI that is

1068
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,480
win-win right I mean if is using

1069
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,960
corporate also uh have opportunities to

1070
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:16,040
work together and and win more as well

1071
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,720
um so incentive to helpme adopting AI is

1072
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:22,480
the second thing I want to uh touch on

1073
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,240
as well um yeah and and and and I think

1074
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,119
um for the rest I'm I'm totally agree

1075
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,200
with with with all the points I think as

1076
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:33,040
also very important because they don't

1077
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:37,480
have the resources I mean to really

1078
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:39,599
implement this AI really need people and

1079
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,119
also resources right can can I just

1080
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,480
elaborate because I I missing um the the

1081
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,760
When you mention the small company

1082
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,079
there's a lot of good AI um companies in

1083
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,640
Thailand

1084
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,880
startups uh who who have that very

1085
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,520
specific products on in verticals

1086
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,760
various verticals

1087
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,960
government and corporates can help and

1088
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,599
and also education can help play

1089
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,280
important role of to to identify those

1090
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,559
startups and allow them to work with the

1091
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,720
corporate you know the the the

1092
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,920
corporates who have you know various use

1093
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,599
case opportunity Market access if we

1094
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,119
allow those uh and and work together

1095
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:24,880
with those uh startups we can create a

1096
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:27,720
lot of a successful um you know new

1097
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,880
generation of of AI Entre entrepreneurs

1098
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,319
and I think that's very important I mean

1099
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,920
we talk about big tech and and those

1100
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:36,880
coming with compute and everything but

1101
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,280
vertical algorithms vertical you know s

1102
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,520
SRM small language model very critical

1103
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,280
for our future and I I think we I want

1104
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,520
to Advocate to to make sure that uh we

1105
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,880
have the opportunity to uh AI startups

1106
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,200
for TI AI startups to to flourish thank

1107
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,319
you kunak we have the last word on this

1108
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,920
round before we start a Q&A session we

1109
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,079
only have eight minutes and many

1110
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,599
questions

1111
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,520
so I I think you were asking about how

1112
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,160
to essentially if I paraphrase right how

1113
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:09,400
to accelerate uh Thailand using with AI

1114
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,000
I think you know coming from

1115
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,559
corporations we always need to Define

1116
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,559
measure of success right we need to

1117
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,280
Define who or what Thailand uh is I

1118
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:18,720
think the who they the the general

1119
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,839
population I think the concept of

1120
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,520
education is is what uh we need to put

1121
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:25,760
in place and you know before back in the

1122
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,040
days kak could not you only could get

1123
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,440
MIT educ ation if you go to MIT but here

1124
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,119
you can actually be anywhere and get MIT

1125
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,599
level of Education fire host equivalent

1126
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:37,440
uh from anywhere so I think we need to

1127
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,920
take advantage of that from you know

1128
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,359
kind of from from the education

1129
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:43,799
standpoint but if you talk about the

1130
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,839
other part essentially the corporations

1131
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:50,359
right Thailand 95% of companies are so

1132
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,480
if we cannot solve problems then there's

1133
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:53,960
no hope that we can actually solve

1134
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,760
Thailand problem

1135
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:00,680
UMB uh we can see either AI s a as a you

1136
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,839
know kind of opportunity or or a threat

1137
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,640
I am a little bit pessimistic on this

1138
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:07,920
one where I I think the the Gap the

1139
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,839
inequality The Divide between the large

1140
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,240
corporations and thees will only get

1141
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,520
wider unless gets help and therefore we

1142
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,680
need to actually help uh smmes the large

1143
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,920
corporations struggle as they are I

1144
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,000
think they'll find ways because they

1145
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,319
have sufficient means and resources but

1146
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
smme I mean we we're talking AI but

1147
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,599
reality is that if you go and askme to

1148
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,680
do proper financial accounting is a

1149
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,280
challenge for them today right I mean if

1150
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,960
you think about in that sense I mean AI

1151
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,480
is this thing like in a light 5 10 years

1152
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:38,559
from now but unfortunately AI is here

1153
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,559
and unless unless you do something about

1154
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,160
it you they'll be left behind even more

1155
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,280
so so program like know the government

1156
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,400
is putting in place uh I think it's

1157
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,400
important but I I guess the the the

1158
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,400
house and the what uh I already

1159
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,000
mentioned won repeat but the measure of

1160
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,520
success to me I think you ought to be

1161
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,040
able to make sure that leverage AI to

1162
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,400
improve things such as productivity uh

1163
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,079
improve things such as the value add

1164
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,160
that they could actually do within the

1165
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,119
product not just producing some basic

1166
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,680
Commodities those are things that we I

1167
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:12,799
think we should find a way to AI to to

1168
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,240
help and if we can do that then I think

1169
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:18,160
we can create an uplift in in in the

1170
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,599
competitiveness and and and once that's

1171
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,000
the case I think there there's a hope

1172
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,720
for the country overall and I I'm quite

1173
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,119
hopeful about the the various programs

1174
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,319
that the big companies and the

1175
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,640
government is actually putting in place

1176
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,160
so so all very supportive and in fact we

1177
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,640
we need to be rooting for

1178
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,680
ourmes okay thank you I think it's loud

1179
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:40,040
and clear so we hope that Kun chatai

1180
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:43,400
will take the message back to the

1181
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:47,440
government really cons a large portion

1182
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:50,559
of our company and they need really need

1183
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,280
help um if we can work only with big

1184
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,960
corporate there will be even larger gap

1185
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,480
between this company now let me turn on

1186
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:02,160
to the question

1187
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,160
please can make it can you make it

1188
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:15,599
larger okay oh that one that cannot see

1189
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:17,720
from there um Can which uh the first one

1190
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:21,440
how do you want to solve privacy and

1191
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:23,160
ethical data sharing can SEC multi

1192
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,000
partic computation and privacy

1193
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,359
preserving blockchain create trust with

1194
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,480
users

1195
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:34,720
for sharing confidential data for banks

1196
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,720
and health um yes

1197
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:46,440
please I was gonna ask okay

1198
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:49,119
please so okay I I'll I'll answer so now

1199
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,480
I think solving I think the technical

1200
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,760
mean to solving confidential and data

1201
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,480
proper data sharing is indeed required

1202
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,319
and whether blockchain is the the

1203
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,319
solution it has has a prospect of being

1204
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:01,400
a solution right we need to look into

1205
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,400
the um the the Computer Resources

1206
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,400
required behind that but there are also

1207
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,559
other techniques right the things being

1208
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,920
popularized like Federated learning

1209
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:10,920
where you don't really need to see

1210
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,440
actual Source uh of the data you can

1211
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,880
actually leverage the data and make use

1212
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,599
of it as much as you like so in in that

1213
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,000
sense you know data from True could be

1214
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,319
used by data uh combined with data from

1215
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,480
scvx to do something even combined with

1216
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:26,680
a BBL but there's some framework around

1217
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,240
that so I'm totally in agree with and

1218
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,960
with the the the person who asked this

1219
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,680
question that we need to solve the the

1220
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,119
problem and it's considered a technical

1221
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,480
problem so we could actually use a

1222
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,920
technical solution be it the blockchain

1223
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,640
or other emerging Technologies and uh

1224
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,400
Solutions which I think Academia is

1225
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,400
actually working actively in this area

1226
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,640
because they know cracking the data is

1227
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,079
is what need to be done and I think uh

1228
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:51,160
it's the right area to to look into if I

1229
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:53,079
could add I agree I think it's a really

1230
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,359
crucial area I think there are

1231
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:56,599
blockchain's one but there are other

1232
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:58,559
Solutions will point to one other one

1233
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:01,079
it's in early stages it's not ready to

1234
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,599
be used in prime time but there are

1235
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,720
people working on it and it's an

1236
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,079
encryption system called homomorphic

1237
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,880
encryption where the idea is that you

1238
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,960
encrypt all of the data into a database

1239
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,559
and you can actually query it without

1240
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,160
ever decrypting the data sounds a little

1241
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,040
strange but there are ways to do it and

1242
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,440
so I think if that becomes practical

1243
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,880
it's as I understand it not yet there

1244
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,280
it's a way to protect the data protect

1245
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,880
the privacy and yet still let you use it

1246
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,839
to get out the broad information that

1247
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,880
you want from that so something to watch

1248
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:34,880
in the future I I think kunat already

1249
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,359
already mentioned about this um data is

1250
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,000
very important in fact it's not only

1251
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:43,119
internal data but it must be data from

1252
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
outside but to to put the two together

1253
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:49,280
that they needs some protection some

1254
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,760
rule of law to govern the an

1255
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,760
anonymization and the creation of this

1256
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,799
big data that way we can share and we

1257
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,960
can learn from it and and I think the

1258
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:59,520
government is now working on this topic

1259
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,160
now let me turn on to the next two

1260
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:06,280
question it's very very similar um the

1261
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:09,720
first one uh intend for DEA now you

1262
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:13,640
cannot um is Thailand planning any

1263
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:16,400
universal basis income if let's say half

1264
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:19,000
of the workforce become Obsolete and

1265
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,079
without any income and Social Security

1266
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
is this a topic at all and and and let's

1267
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:28,240
move on to the next one also um the next

1268
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,240
question please

1269
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:35,559
with AI replacing lowlevel task pushing

1270
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,160
human to higher level works is there a

1271
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:40,039
limit to how far this chift can go could

1272
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,720
we eventually hit a wall when human

1273
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:45,680
capability can keep our place I I think

1274
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:49,440
this is the question about the AI

1275
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,200
replacing the workforce right what this

1276
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,240
is the consequence that we have to face

1277
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,400
later on even though today we have

1278
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,720
listened to many people said AI is

1279
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:01,280
helping human but but in fact when we we

1280
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:04,920
think about robot when you put robot

1281
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,240
with AI there will be a lot of job

1282
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,720
losing to this kind of human humanoid

1283
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:13,039
robot right um in the warehouse It's

1284
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:16,640
Already Gone um now byd Factory is now a

1285
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:19,319
lot of humanoid robot walking around and

1286
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,200
and many more so basically a lot of job

1287
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:23,839
will be

1288
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:27,319
disappear what to do I mean do do

1289
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:30,119
government have some scheme preparing

1290
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:32,799
for this change I think the we have seen

1291
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:35,640
the change throughout the history for

1292
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:38,160
several times we see the um the

1293
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,359
Industrial Revolution for a a couple of

1294
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,240
times already and I think this one is

1295
00:57:40,359 --> 00:57:47,760
going to replace some jobs the low level

1296
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:49,599
um the repetitive um task as well um and

1297
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,799
the the best thing that we can do right

1298
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:56,200
now is upskilling the workforce to be

1299
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:59,400
able to move on to the um upper chain uh

1300
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:03,760
of the the the the industry so um they

1301
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:08,240
can do a a much more uh

1302
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:10,880
human uh worthy worthy job in the future

1303
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:15,280
um I would say that um it's going to

1304
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:19,359
replace a job and it's our of probably

1305
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:22,119
our best interest to keep our human kind

1306
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:24,480
uh move up the value chain um and the

1307
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:27,520
thing is I saw one question about you

1308
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,240
Universal basic income um I I am not

1309
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,760
aware of that like is it going to be the

1310
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,920
10,000 B scheme that the government has

1311
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:40,920
produced but um we would love to have

1312
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:43,119
all humans on Deck um to to help U with

1313
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,720
the Aging society that we are facing in

1314
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,000
Thailand so um we would not have the

1315
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,160
scheme that have the people um take

1316
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,240
advantage of the the universal basic

1317
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,880
income in the future I this is my

1318
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:59,680
personal view okay I think we of time

1319
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,400
but but any participant the panel would

1320
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:06,440
like to um chip in on the question of

1321
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:08,880
the human losing job because of AI what

1322
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,319
can we do what how can we

1323
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,880
prepare no

1324
00:59:11,319 --> 00:59:18,559
okay okay so today we have listened

1325
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,880
to very interesting and insightful

1326
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:23,799
discussion on the use case of AI in

1327
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,119
Thailand the challenges the incentive

1328
00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:28,599
the infrastructure that we can put to

1329
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:31,039
adopt AI I think everyone would agree

1330
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:33,480
that there are many things to be done

1331
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,640
and especially listening from Professor

1332
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:39,200
Crimson at in the morning

1333
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:43,480
session three key important component

1334
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:46,559
deep learning data Computing cloud is

1335
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,920
all there I think with all this

1336
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,240
component in place we probably will have

1337
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:54,240
the golden golden age of AI later on and

1338
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,200
Thailand cannot miss out so let's work

1339
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,000
together and try to solve the problem

1340
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:03,119
and put Thailand in the map thank

1341
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,119
you thank you

1342
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:12,030
