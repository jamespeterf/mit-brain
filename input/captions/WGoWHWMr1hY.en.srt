00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,839
Hi everyone and welcome back to the uh

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,919
introductory series for the obesity

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,719
machine learning competition. My name is

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,800
Julie Laffy and I'm a post-doal fellow

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,120
uh at the Broad Institute in the Eric

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,119
and Wendy Schmidt Center. uh and my

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,000
research there uh involves taking

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,160
approaches from computation uh and from

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,880
interpretable uh machine learning and

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,720
applying this to uh biological context

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,279
to understand disease and I'm

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,439
particularly interested in uh cancer

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,520
immune context.

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
So I'll be taking you through uh the

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
remaining two lectures of this

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,719
introductory series lecture two and

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,640
lecture three. Um and today we'll be uh

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,640
in this lecture talking about uh

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,559
technology.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,600
So in the first lecture you will have

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,239
heard from Thiago um and learn about

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,559
adipose tissue um and the adiposite

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,199
cells that make up this tissue um and

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,760
then also how when things go wrong um

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,239
this can lead to uh metabolic diseases

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,400
like obesity.

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,080
And uh in this lecture we'll be talking

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,360
about uh two revolutionary technologies

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,479
um that will allow us to uh both probe

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,640
uh and profile individual uh adiposite

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,600
cells uh so that we can better

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,520
understand um how um as I mentioned when

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,520
they go wrong this can lead to uh

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,520
obesity.

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,240
So um we've broken down this lecture

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,280
into three parts. uh in the first we'll

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,040
learn about an important concept um of

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,640
gene expression programs. You can think

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,360
of these uh like the uh functional uh

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,439
units that cells use to have specific

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,799
functions. Um and then in parts B and C

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,320
we'll talk about these two key

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,759
technologies uh to profile and to probe

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,399
uh cells that I mentioned on the

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,880
previous slide. So in part A, gene

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,680
expression programs. So just to take a

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,320
step back uh and remind ourselves uh

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,680
what a gene is. So uh a gene is the

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,599
fundamental unit uh of inheritance. Um

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,080
and uh our genes live inside uh the DNA.

51
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,480
Um and so they're encoded by this uh

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,599
four-letter code uh where the four

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,360
letters are adinine, thymine, cytosine,

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,440
and guanine or ATC and G.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,160
Uh and these genes carry uh all uh the

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,640
traits that make us up. Um so both uh

57
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,800
physical traits like our height uh and

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,720
our eye color uh and maybe our hair

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,200
color uh but also uh biological traits

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,959
um and uh often traits that are also

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,519
associated with uh disease.

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,080
And so from these genes, you can get

63
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,560
what is a really incredible uh diversity

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,440
of cell types and tissues um in the

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,160
human body. So um here I'm just showing

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,879
you a few examples. You can see uh cells

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,760
in the skin, the epithelial cells, uh

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,159
cells in the small intestine, cells in

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,040
uh that make up your blood vessels, uh

70
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,800
and also um the cells in adapose tissue.

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,280
So the adiposite cells that we we're

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,239
talking about today.

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,400
And um there are really two uh things

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,840
that are quite incredible I think when

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,319
we look at this. Um the first is just

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,360
the sheer diversity of cell types um

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,800
that arise from our genes. Um and the

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,840
second is um the fact that every single

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,400
cell has the same uh set of genes or the

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,040
same DNA. Um and so um how is it that uh

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,120
this can lead to cells looking like they

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,000
do in the small intestine in one case

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,879
but like they do in the adipos tissue or

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,680
in the skin epithelium in another. And

85
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,040
so um the answer to this is gene

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,280
regulation. Um and so um what actually

87
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,439
happens is that uh the genes which

88
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,599
encode these traits um and as we

89
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,560
mentioned which uh are encoded in the

90
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,480
DNA they uh undergo a process called

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,480
transcription um which produces RNA and

92
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,959
uh the RNA is like a um copy that's made

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,599
um of the gene. So for every gene you

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,000
get some copies of RNA. Um and the key

95
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,560
point here is that uh different genes

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,520
are switched on in different cells. So

97
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,919
in a cell in um adipose tissue for

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,400
example in an adiposite cell we would

99
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,800
see the adiposite gene switched on and

100
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,759
so we would produce a lot of RNA that

101
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
corresponds to those adiposite cells. So

102
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,320
now we've spoken about the genes and

103
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,240
gene regulation and how this allows

104
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,880
certain genes to be switched on in some

105
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,440
cells and others in other cells. Um and

106
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,720
so here you can see a schematic of this.

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,960
So this is um an illustration of a um

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,360
what we call an expression matrix where

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,000
every row is a different gene and every

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,800
column is a different cell and um the um

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,040
red boxes represent when a gene is uh

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
switched on or is active uh in a

113
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,919
particular cell. And so what we see is

114
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,479
that um actually rather than individual

115
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,479
genes representing uh different cell

116
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,120
types in those different tissues that we

117
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,759
spoke about that actually um it's a

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,240
group of genes um that define these

119
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,639
different identities. So for example, we

120
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,960
have these first three genes here which

121
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,120
are switched on in epithelial cells. And

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,759
so this would be maybe an epithelial

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
gene expression program.

124
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,080
And then we have uh these next two genes

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,039
that are uh switched on in blood cells.

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,440
So this is uh perhaps a blood uh cell

127
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
gene expression program. Uh and then

128
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,080
finally another two genes which are

129
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,240
specific to uh the adiposite cells. Um

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,800
and so this would be an adiposite gene

131
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,400
expression program.

132
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,360
Um, and so, um, measuring, uh, the

133
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,080
amount of this RNA in every single cell

134
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,560
will allow us to tell, um, which gene

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,880
expression programs, uh, are present in

136
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,199
the different cells and by that means

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,199
really identify what these cells are,

138
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
uh, and hopefully, uh, learn what

139
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,759
they're doing.

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,639
And so um we spoke a little bit about

141
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,639
gene express gene expression programs uh

142
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:22,479
and how these define uh cell identity

143
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,479
and um here we're looking uh at the

144
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,800
zoomed in version of what uh I showed

145
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,160
you um a couple of slides ago. This is

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,560
adapose tissue. Um and you can see um

147
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,720
that the gene expression programs uh in

148
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,240
adapose tissue um create this phenotype

149
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,080
whereby the cells are very big um and

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,720
they have lots of fat stored inside

151
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,240
them, lots of lipids um and so as a

152
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
function of that they have this really

153
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,319
thin cell membrane and they also have

154
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,479
the nucleus which are these little

155
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,639
purple specks that are pushed off to the

156
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,039
side. Um so this is to um permit the

157
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,759
main function of the adiposite cells to

158
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,160
uh produce and store uh lipids uh

159
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,560
leading to this phenotype. But even

160
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,360
within adapose tissue uh and within

161
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,599
adiposite cells you actually can have uh

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,520
different gene expressions uh that lead

163
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,599
to different functions of adiposite

164
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,400
cells. And so uh in this uh tissue which

165
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,560
is also adapost tissue um we see a very

166
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,840
different phenotype um that actually

167
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,479
represents um particularly uh

168
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,520
metabolically metabolically active uh

169
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:35,759
adeposites. And so um the reason for

170
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,000
this uh different uh phenotype is um one

171
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,840
these cells produce um a lot of

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,880
mitochondria um and are very

173
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,960
mitochondrially active. And so the kind

174
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,800
of pink tint that you see here is

175
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,280
actually coming from the density of

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,400
these mitochondria.

177
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,960
Um and they also have uh much smaller

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,080
lip lipid droplets which are the um

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
white blobs as opposed to just uh the

180
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,960
very large version of those droplets

181
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,639
that you see um in the classic adapose

182
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,879
tissue.

183
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,120
And so um if we kind of dive in um we

184
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,360
can think of this uh classical adapose

185
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,560
tissue as being made up uh principally

186
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,400
of these adiposite cells. Um these are

187
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,199
actually uh generated uh via what we

188
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,639
call a differentiation pathway from this

189
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,440
earlier uh much smaller cell um called

190
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,440
uh priiposite.

191
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,959
And um in the metabolically uh active uh

192
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,560
tissue um this is actually specialized

193
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,120
uh functions uh that um that these

194
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,120
adiposite cells perform. Um and so these

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,279
are still adiposices. Uh but there may

196
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,480
be adiposytes that are particularly

197
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,440
concerned with the formation um and

198
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,440
generation of lipids. Uh or uh

199
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,240
particularly concerned with actually

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,760
using up fuel and breaking it up to uh

201
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,519
release heat. So we typically uh refer

202
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,160
to these um as differentiation programs

203
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,040
uh that define these uh particular cell

204
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,640
identities um and to the lipogenic and

205
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,560
thermogenic as uh metabolic programs.

206
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,120
And um one reason that we're

207
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,760
particularly uh interested in these

208
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,040
programs is because um of their

209
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,279
association uh to obesity. Um and so

210
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,000
what we know is that uh skewed

211
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,320
proportions of some of these uh cells in

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,720
particular uh for example a high

213
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,839
proportion of adiposytes uh or a high

214
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,760
proportion of lipogenic adiposites or a

215
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,920
uh low proportion of thermogenic

216
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,800
adiposytes um is linked to obesity. And

217
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
so the hope is that uh by really

218
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,320
understanding these different cells um

219
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,480
we can uh do a better job at treating uh

220
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,600
patients with obesity.

221
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,640
So we do know uh some things already. Um

222
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,800
so if you remember uh we introduced uh

223
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,360
that uh gene expression programs are

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,240
made up of uh genes that go up and down

225
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,200
together uh depending on um which cell

226
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,200
they're expressed in. And so um I've

227
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,959
highlighted just a couple of the genes

228
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,000
that we know to mark these different

229
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:21,040
cells. Um and so you can see here for

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,160
example PDGFRA.

231
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,959
PDGFRA uh is a gene which allows the

232
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,839
padiposite population uh to proliferate

233
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,800
and divide um and lead to this uh

234
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,959
diversity of adiposite cells um that we

235
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,640
can see here.

236
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,279
Um and in the adiposite cell um adipo Q

237
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,720
is a hallmark gene. Uh this is a gene

238
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,680
that allows um adipose tissue to signal

239
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,200
to other tissues um and do things like

240
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,279
uh regulate insulin activity.

241
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
Um and so that's great. We already have

242
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,839
some uh information and uh some ability

243
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,880
to kind of identify these different

244
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:05,200
populations. Um but really what we would

245
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,920
like um is uh first of all uh to to

246
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,320
understand not just a few genes um that

247
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,000
are switched on or off in each of these

248
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,360
um each of these different cells. uh but

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,560
actually to be able to measure uh all

250
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,040
20,000 genes um that are in uh the human

251
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,480
genome uh and understand what their

252
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,720
relationship is to each of these

253
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,800
identities.

254
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,360
Uh the second uh problem here is that um

255
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,760
we know for specific genes within these

256
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,440
programs um what they're doing like I

257
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,600
mentioned PDGFRA in the uh priiposite

258
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:47,279
and um adipoq uh in the uh

259
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,160
differentiated adiposite um but what

260
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,600
about all other 20,000 genes so if we

261
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,000
delete PDGFRA the cells uh won't be able

262
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,959
to proliferate as well uh What about if

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,760
we delete all 20,000 other genes in the

264
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,360
human genome? Will we be able um to

265
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,360
understand better what they do?
