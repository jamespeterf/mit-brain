00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,279
Modern warehouses are adopting an

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,320
increasing level of automation and

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,960
technologies to manage the complexities

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,360
associated to the growth of e-commerce.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,800
Some of the most relevant technologies

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,240
that these warehouses are including are

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,279
related to robotics. For example, the

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,920
automated storage and retrieval system.

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,880
If we focus on warehouse robotics, the

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:34,239
global market reach in 2024 $25 billion

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,160
and it's expected to reach $50 billion

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,960
in the next 5 years. the integration of

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,640
technologies like the internet of things

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,760
devices, sensors, computer vision or

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,200
advanced artificial intelligence systems

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,239
is what really can unlock the potential

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,920
of highly automated warehouses. Find
