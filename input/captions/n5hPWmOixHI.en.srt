00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,319
From the MIT Energy Initiative, this is

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,800
What If It Works, looking at the energy

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,060
solutions for climate change. I'm Cara

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,640
And today we're joined by Munji Buendi.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,160
He's a professor of chemistry at MIT who

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,880
has thought a lot about creative ways to

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,840
reimagine clean energy technologies. He

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,920
also recently received the Nobel Prize.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,840
He's a co-winner of the 2023 prize in

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,760
chemistry. But Wendy's early research

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,000
led to more energyefficient lighting and

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,280
televisions, but also to lots of work on

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,840
creating more efficient solar cells. As

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,280
a post-doal student, he worked in the

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,320
famed Bell Labs, a place where he says

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,239
he learned a lot about chemistry in part

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,960
because there just weren't that many

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,520
people around to help him out. It was an

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,159
amazing place because it was populated

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,119
with extremely talented, ambitious

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,439
scientists that were giving a lot of

25
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,520
trust and a lot of free reign. It was a

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,320
place that had a lot of equipment, but

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,840
not many hands. As a result, you had to

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,520
build a community if you wanted to get

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,840
anything done. So, everybody was happy

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,799
to talk to anybody else. In fact, it was

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,720
part of the job to to talk to everybody.

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,000
There was no army of graduate students.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,079
It was each scientist with a technician

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,799
and maybe a postoc and that was pretty

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,360
much it. What that meant, Boendi says,

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
is that he learned a ton. Now, by

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,560
contrast, he does a lot of paperwork in

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,799
order to have the funds to keep his lab

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,159
running and to support his doctoral and

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,640
post-doal students. At Bell Labs, he

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,840
spent a great deal of his time just

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,079
thinking about science. What I didn't

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
know much about or really much at all

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
about was synthetic chemistry, making

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,439
things. You know, I was a measurement

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,759
person. But at Bell Labs, in the

47
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
atmosphere of Bell Labs, you were you

48
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,760
were allowed and encouraged to learn new

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,319
things and to try new things. And I

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,760
worked in Mike Stigerwal's group lab

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,640
rather, who was a organic metallic

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,800
chemist makes molecules and he taught me

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,360
everything I know about chemistry, how

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,720
to make molecules, you know, using

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,920
inorganic chemistry. And then from uh

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,720
from Bill Wilson who's now uh at Harvard

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,560
who was a a laser expert you know I

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,280
learned everything about visible lasers

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,080
from from him and from Lewis I learned

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,000
how to think through Bruce he was you

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,480
know was sort of the the chief thinker.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,560
It was at Bell Labs that Bo Wendy

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,840
started working on something that would

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,080
eventually be called quantum dots. Here

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,680
he is explaining what a quantum dot is.

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
The quantum part of quantum dot is

67
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
because the electron that you put in the

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,879
quantum dot no longer acts like a little

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,879
particle moving in in a wire. It's

70
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,480
behaves like a wave. That's the quantum.

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,080
That's the magical part of quantum

72
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,800
mechanics. That's when you get to really

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,760
small scales. Things that you think of

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,319
as particles are now described by waves.

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,319
Okay. So, now that you're trying to get

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,680
your head around the idea that tiny,

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,519
tiny particles are, in some sense,

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,000
waves, think back for a minute to your

79
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,879
junior high school band and the various

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,599
instruments in that band. Why did they

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
sound the way they did? So, if you look

82
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,440
at a flute or a piccolo, you know that

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,519
the sound of a flute or piccolo are

84
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
really different. The flute is lower

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,840
pitched than a piccolo. And why is that?

86
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,440
Because the soundwave in a flute has a

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,959
bigger cavity than a piccolo. And for

88
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
organ pipes, it's the same thing. So a

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,280
little tiny organ pipe sounds much

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,959
higher pitched than a big organ pipe.

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
And so you can think of the electron in

92
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,640
the quantum dot in the same way. The

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,840
wave of the electron is has a different

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,680
pitch depending on the size of the dot.

95
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Okay, just like for the organ pipe. And

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,080
what does pitch mean for an electron?

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
It's the energy. So the energy in a

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
small of an electron in a small box is

99
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,720
higher than the energy of an electron in

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,519
a big box. But Wendy says that when the

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,639
electron releases its energy, it turns

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,199
into a wave, a light wave. High energy

103
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,440
colors tend to be blue and low energy

104
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,520
colors tend to be red. You got your

105
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,400
rainbow. So the higher energy electron

106
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,000
gives rise to bluer light coming out and

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,680
the lower energy. So there's there's

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,199
your size effect right there, right?

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,840
from small to large just like in an

110
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,880
organ pipe. So if you think of the sound

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,400
as being colors then the high-pitched

112
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,759
little organ pipe is blue and the low

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,560
pitched big organ pipe is red. The work

114
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,600
on quantum dots was part of a quest to

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
make better quality materials for

116
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,639
communication because Bell Labs was

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,280
after all part of a telephone company.

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,759
But it would be a while before Bowendi

119
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,960
realized that the work he was doing

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,880
might have implications for clean

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,600
energy. When he first had a sense that

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,400
it could, he was collaborating with a

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,199
chemical engineer who had friends at the

124
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,759
tech company Huelet Packard. And so he

125
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:30,639
had a supply of these brand new labbased

126
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,720
gallium nitride dodes. The first thing

127
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,320
that we tried, I mixed the quantum dots

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
in polymer and put them on top of a blue

129
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,120
diode to change the color because there

130
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,080
was a big push to create uh more

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,960
efficient uh lighting, white light. So

132
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,520
by mixing different colors of dots

133
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,840
together and pumping them with this very

134
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,240
efficient blue light source, we could

135
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,199
make white light. And that was really

136
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,919
the beginning of me thinking about the

137
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,160
dots in the energy world. And that was

138
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,880
the late 90s. And we wrote a paper I

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,720
think around 2000 or 2002 on that.

140
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,319
Quantum dots are now used widely in

141
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,520
televisions. And as they've made us more

142
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,880
energy efficient, the irony is our

143
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,000
appetite for them has grown, especially

144
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,880
in outdoor in a bright room. Uh so

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,759
there's room for expansion in the in the

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,759
screen business to make more and more

147
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,639
screens bigger and bigger and brighter

148
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,520
and brighter. The quantum dots are used

149
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,080
in the screens again as a way of color

150
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,880
shifting. So you use a source of blue

151
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,880
light either gallium nitride dodes or

152
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,199
blue OLEDs in the newer televisions and

153
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,840
use the quantum dots to create all the

154
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,440
other colors in a very energyefficient

155
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,039
manner because you only create the

156
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
colors that you need as opposed to the

157
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,639
previous generations of televisions

158
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,240
where you created white and then you

159
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
filtered out the colors you didn't need.

160
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,840
So you you wasted a lot of energy in all

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,840
these colors that you just threw out. Um

162
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,840
and so now we have, you know, much more

163
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,599
energy efficient, much nicer colors,

164
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
better colors. And what happened is that

165
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,120
the televisions just get bigger and

166
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
bigger. They just use the same energy,

167
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
maybe a little even a little less, but

168
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
they just get bigger and brighter. And

169
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,400
now you can use them in a sunny day and

170
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,199
and in your room. It reminds me a little

171
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,039
bit of when the manufacturing of clothes

172
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,800
got mechanized, people went from maybe

173
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,840
having three outfits to having like 50

174
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,080
outfits, right? Because like and and so

175
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,680
humans find a way. Exactly. So, it's

176
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,240
interesting that, you know, just because

177
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,319
you can make lights or televisions more

178
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
efficient, then we say, "Okay, great.

179
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,880
Then we're going to double that screen

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,280
size because why not? Who doesn't want a

181
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,759
bigger television?" So that's emission

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,000
where we're we're making light using

183
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,160
these things or shifting light into

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,440
range of colors that we want. But you've

185
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,960
also used quantum dots in solar cells to

186
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
capture light and make electricity.

187
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,280
Right. Sure. So um I think I started

188
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,280
going into that soon after probably the

189
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,240
mid

190
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,000
2000s and the idea first was to make

191
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,720
photo detectors because you could then

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,599
really tune the sweet spot of that photo

193
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,360
detector to to particular wavelengths.

194
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,360
What is a photo detector? Something that

195
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,560
turns light into electricity. Okay.

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,560
Light in, electricity out. And that then

197
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,120
morphed into solar because you know

198
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,919
light into electricity and and our our

199
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,719
first foray and I was doing this with u

200
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,640
a colleague and Vladimir Bulovich whom

201
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,279
I've had a long-standing collaboration

202
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,560
starting from 2000 basically uh the

203
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,880
quantum dot said because you can tune

204
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,680
their what they absorb in terms of color

205
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,560
you can tune them so that they are in

206
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,760
the sweet spot for the solar spectrum

207
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
for converting

208
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,720
as much of the solar spectrum as you can

209
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,640
and solar is actually a very slow moving

210
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,640
field because you've got an established

211
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,519
material silicon that works really

212
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,839
really well and the cost of silicon you

213
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,480
know follows a law called Swanson's law

214
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,640
which is that the cost goes down by 20%

215
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,399
for every doubling in production that's

216
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,800
been going on for 70 years it's the

217
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,880
solar of Moore's law I was going to say

218
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,560
I know Moore's law but Swanson's law I'm

219
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,399
going to have to add to it okay anytime

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
you have a mature technology there's

221
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
this kind of law associated with it it's

222
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,640
basically a scaling law the more you

223
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,640
make the cheaper it is basically so that

224
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,800
that scaling is largely taking place in

225
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,160
China right now it's taking place in

226
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,120
China right and so the whole US industry

227
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,480
where silicon photovoltaics began has

228
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,040
moved away and and does using quantum

229
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,880
dots to create different sorts of panels

230
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,760
offer the possibility of reshoring that

231
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,000
to some extent so what we've learned

232
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
from the quantum docs is that using them

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,640
as the functional material to replace

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,279
silicon is probably not going to be cost

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,760
effective because silicon is so cheap.

236
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,720
So the cost of anything depends on the

237
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,640
number of steps you need to make it. The

238
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,320
more steps the more expensive it is.

239
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,160
Silicon you process the silicon and you

240
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,640
make it pretty much in one step. You

241
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,360
know you crystallize the silicon and you

242
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
cut it in pieces. The dots you have to

243
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,800
make the dots first. then you have to

244
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,160
process them and so you got a few steps

245
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,959
in there and some of the components of

246
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,360
making the dots uh may not be very

247
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,640
cheap. So everything in solar needs to

248
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,640
be really really inexpensive

249
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,160
and the quantum dots as a functional

250
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,440
material I don't think are going to be

251
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,839
inexpensive enough to replace silicon

252
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,320
but they can add to it for instance

253
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,640
silicon doesn't absorb very well in the

254
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,720
UV or the blue but the quantum dots can

255
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,440
and they can remit light that silicon

256
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
can absorb really well. So you can

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
combine them not as a functional

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
material but as this downshifting

259
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,880
material

260
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
um where you so you're going out and

261
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,279
getting more light that you can bring

262
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,040
into the range that that the silicon can

263
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,800
absorb better. So you'd have both of

264
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,079
them existing like if you were talking

265
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
about a solar panel that went on a

266
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
building or something or in a field or

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
whatever they would both exist both the

268
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,560
silicon and the top one would enhance

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,519
the other. So they're directly on top of

270
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,120
those cells or the bottom. Uhhuh. that

271
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
those are called tandem cells if I

272
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,760
understand right so the bottom would be

273
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,240
are called birectional or bfacial cells

274
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,480
facial bfacial cells yeah and they're

275
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,920
making those now right bfacial cells are

276
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
are existing yes they're they're

277
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,800
becoming they're going online yeah so

278
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,040
traditionally you think of a silicon

279
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
panel as absorbing light from above you

280
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,000
know directly from the sun but there's

281
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,560
all this light that's being reflected

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,640
from the ground that comes back up from

283
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,399
the ground so if you can capture some of

284
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,240
that light you can increase the amount

285
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,680
of electricity I see. So when you say

286
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,160
bfacial, you're really talking about

287
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,920
like this is a double-sided solar cell,

288
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,600
right? Instead of Exactly. is what we

289
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,440
think of as like we see them on a house,

290
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
the thing that goes up towards the sun

291
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,600
is the thing that matters. You're saying

292
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,000
like, no, you can make the thing that's

293
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,000
on the underside matter, too. Yeah. And

294
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,040
then you can use dots on either side to

295
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,600
help you catch more of the light that

296
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,680
you need in order to increase the

297
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
efficiency of the panel. And if you

298
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,600
increase the efficiency of a silicon

299
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,760
panel from let's say 21% to 22% that's

300
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,200
real money. You know it's sounds like a

301
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,279
5% change but if you go from 21% to 23%

302
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
you say that's 2% change but actually

303
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,959
that's actually a 10% change in the

304
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
amount of electricity that comes out.

305
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,959
That's real, right? When are these

306
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,600
things coming? when I when can I go out

307
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,000
to

308
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,320
alti you know like I said solar is is

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,639
slow moving because silicon works so

310
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,320
well not only does it work so well it's

311
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,959
extremely stable so any thing that we

312
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,440
add to silicon has to last as long as

313
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,399
the silicon panel right which is 30

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
years or even

315
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,360
more and so that's where you get the

316
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,959
problem that's a challenge so you have

317
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,279
to end up engineering protective layers

318
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,760
and and and that costs money. It get

319
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,839
just gets harder. I see. Right. So there

320
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,079
all these ideas that are extremely

321
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,519
interesting ideas from a science or

322
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,800
technology perspective, but then when

323
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,279
you add the layer of the

324
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,519
commercialization, the business part of

325
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,360
it, then you have to realize, you know,

326
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,959
some things are just not going to be

327
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,040
worth it cuz they're never going to be

328
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,399
cost effective and others they could

329
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,540
become cost effective, but it's going to

330
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,590
take some work.

331
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,590
[Music]

332
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
You know, there's another application

333
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
which is an interesting application that

334
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,600
there's a small company out of um

335
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,200
Arizona that's pursuing. It's not a new

336
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,279
application, but they're really pushing

337
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,800
it forward. It's for um

338
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,800
agriculture.

339
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,959
So, when plants grow, you know, they

340
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,279
like light, photosynthesis, right? But

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,320
they don't like a lot of UV light or

342
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,800
blue light because it burns the plants.

343
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,519
So you can actually have better yield of

344
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,360
your crops if you take some of that blue

345
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,800
light or UV light and turn it into red

346
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,480
light. So they're coming out with these

347
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,240
very inexpensive products that are

348
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,839
basically films plastic with quantum

349
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,320
dots embedded in them that you throw

350
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,800
inside a wear a greenhouse. They will

351
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,959
take some of the blue light remitted as

352
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,480
red light and increase the yield of crop

353
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,760
production by 20% to 25%. It's just

354
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,839
amazing. So this is if I like owned a

355
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,440
greenhouse and I was going to get this.

356
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,279
This is just some sort of film or

357
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
something that you put you've got your

358
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,800
windows in your greenhouse and you put

359
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,519
it there so that when the light comes in

360
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,600
from the sun, there's like a little bit

361
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,920
of fiddling with it from the quantum

362
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
dots and then the plants are happier and

363
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,639
grow better. Exactly. Yeah. They just

364
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,920
see a brighter light in the spectrum

365
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,160
spectral range that they want that they

366
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,600
like. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that in some

367
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,399
ways that also contributes a lot to

368
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,120
energy efficiency because if you can

369
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,600
grow fewer plants, right, fertilize less

370
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,880
and you get a better yield. Just you

371
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
didn't really have to do anything too

372
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,839
fancy. Absolutely. And initially the

373
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
application in green houses was okay, so

374
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,600
we're going to filter out some of the

375
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,079
blue lights that the plants don't like.

376
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,560
take some of that red emitted light and

377
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,560
make electricity out of it and then

378
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,399
power fans. So that improves the

379
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,199
economics of the which would improve the

380
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,480
improve the economics. Mhm. But it's not

381
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,320
clear that that's the best way of the

382
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,399
DOSs either because you know okay so you

383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,800
power fans with light that you filtered

384
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,040
out but maybe you know all you need is a

385
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,279
little tiny silicon PV that you put to

386
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,199
the side of the greenhouse you get the

387
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,639
same result and then you filter out the

388
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,759
light with something cheaper. So the

389
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,199
economics of combining the two together,

390
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,680
you know, trying to make something do

391
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:03,199
two things at

392
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,040
once may not be quite right. And that's

393
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,759
how they got to the idea, well, you

394
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,839
know, the plants like red light. We've

395
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,839
got these films that were created. It's

396
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,639
much easier to make a film that doesn't

397
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,480
wave guide, that just remits

398
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,920
than to try to make it turn into

399
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,560
electricity, which then you can use

400
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,279
maybe to power red LEDs to make more red

401
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,920
light. So, let's just make a product

402
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,240
that makes one thing really well.

403
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,680
Instead of making a a film, coating a

404
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,160
film with quantum dots, could you make a

405
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,279
spray that actually coats the plant? Say

406
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,880
the corn. Are they too expensive or

407
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,279
coats the window? Could you spray the

408
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,199
coat the window? Yeah. Yeah. Coating the

409
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,040
windows is another way or or integrating

410
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
the dots directly into the window. So,

411
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,240
the next thing is going to be to to make

412
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,839
the windows directly so you don't have

413
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,160
to buy a film, you know, you make the

414
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,000
windows with dots in them. Uh-huh. Are

415
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,920
people doing this in their green houses

416
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
yet or is this not in commercialization

417
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,279
land yet? It's um it's in the testing

418
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,480
phase. Okay. So, you know, there are

419
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,600
contracts from the government, from

420
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,280
NASA, from other places. There are

421
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,439
collaborations between large companies

422
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,240
and these startups to do that. And it's

423
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,559
in the um a phase where they're

424
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
demonstrating the the possibilities. And

425
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,480
then, you know, whether it's going to be

426
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,199
adopted

427
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:22,000
is is always it's in the marketplace.

428
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,360
We've talked about different companies

429
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,079
doing different things with quantum

430
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,720
dots. Are there just give me a sense?

431
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,120
Obviously, this is something that you

432
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,960
did initially, but now it's like way

433
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,919
beyond you. It's sort of out there in

434
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,520
the in the public domain. Are there just

435
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,919
like are there hundreds of companies

436
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,840
that are working on things related to

437
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,520
quantum dots in all different realms or

438
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,039
do you have a sense or Yeah, I would say

439
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,760
they're probably hundreds of companies.

440
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay. Yeah. All over the world. And what

441
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,480
large and small and what are the big

442
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,480
like if we were to look at a you know

443
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,200
pie chart of what they were doing what

444
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,720
are the big you know chunks of thing

445
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,960
like the main things that those

446
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,760
companies are doing with the quantum

447
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,640
dots the biggest thing is uh screens

448
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,960
display screens for like television for

449
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,280
televisions for laptops for displays of

450
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,320
all sorts you know automotive whatever

451
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,480
okay uh that's the biggest so they're

452
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,440
made in in the dots are made in in huge

453
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,880
factories and on on a huge scale for

454
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,720
that. How much how much do quantum dots

455
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,679
add to the cost of a computer screen? Is

456
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,679
it is it a big fraction? It's tiny. I

457
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,240
would say probably there are two huge

458
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,760
manufacturers of dots right now that

459
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,160
that provide essentially all the dots

460
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,360
that are in the marketplace. And one of

461
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,559
them is Samsung, okay, or Hansel

462
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,120
Chemicals, which is part of the Samsung

463
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,240
um business and and then there's a

464
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,400
Japanese company uh Show Chemicals and

465
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,440
they provide and then there are all

466
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,799
these little startups that are trying

467
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,760
to to work in that field. But it's

468
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,160
interesting because you said the cost

469
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,640
may make it really difficult to compete

470
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,559
with like the incumbent solar panels

471
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,679
that they're like people know how to do

472
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,280
them. It's cheap. It's fine. But then if

473
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,919
they're so widely used in computer

474
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,840
screens and television screens, why is

475
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,480
that cost effective? But like solar

476
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,120
panels, like maybe that won't work out.

477
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,640
The kind of dots that are made for the

478
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,520
screens are made to emit light really

479
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,880
efficiently. If you want to make dots

480
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,760
for solar panels, they also have to

481
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,600
conduct electricity really efficiently.

482
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,440
The amount of dots you need to make

483
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,080
light in a screen is pretty small.

484
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,240
Um the same thing for the aggro business

485
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,799
because really all you need to absorb is

486
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,320
a little bit of blue light, some of the

487
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,880
blue light in the solar panel. You want

488
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,559
to absorb all of the

489
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,280
colors, the whole solar spectrum. You

490
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,679
need a lot more material and then you're

491
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,679
competing with the silicon and you're

492
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
competing with the stability of silicon.

493
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,640
The stability of the dots in the in the

494
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,160
TVs is actually incredibly good. Um

495
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,720
meaning they'll last for a long time.

496
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,360
They're going to last forever. Mhm. In a

497
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,480
solar environment, you need to create

498
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,000
electrons. Whenever you have electrons

499
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
around, you can do chemistry with those

500
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,080
electrons. And that's the part that

501
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,000
really hard with the dots to make them

502
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,480
last 30 years in presence of all these

503
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,480
electrons. Now, you've also used quantum

504
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,880
dots in number of biological

505
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,280
applications as well. Talk about that a

506
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,280
little bit. That actually was the first

507
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,120
commercial application of quantum dots,

508
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,240
which is a little backwards when you

509
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,559
think about it because it's a really

510
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,039
hard application. much. You know, the

511
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,919
TVs is really easy in comparison because

512
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,919
we make the dots in organic solvents,

513
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,840
meaning not in water. Then you have to

514
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,760
work really hard to get the dots into

515
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,159
water into a biological environment and

516
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,280
protect them. You could inject them into

517
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,520
somebody and they would go to some place

518
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,039
where you would image them for example.

519
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,120
Yeah. So the first application was with

520
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,480
cell imaging. You target different parts

521
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,240
of a cell and you see it in in the

522
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,960
emission in the light that comes out and

523
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,960
you can map out a cell very similar to

524
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,960
what had already been happening with die

525
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,720
molecules and we use die molecules for

526
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,240
this all the time and now people

527
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,159
there's the first company was started in

528
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,200
98 I know I helped start that company

529
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,679
quantum dot corporation and now the the

530
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,600
dots are part of thermopisher can just

531
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,280
buy the dots from thermopfisher for

532
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,799
biological applications and so there's

533
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:36,240
still a market for them. And we've used

534
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:39,360
them also for invivo imaging with animal

535
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,760
models of cancer, you know, to

536
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,360
understand the micro environment of of a

537
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:48,240
tumor, to understand blood flow in

538
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,280
tumors with collaborations with folks at

539
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,440
the at MGH at Harvard Medical School. So

540
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,159
you're like dying these little things so

541
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,400
that people then can track right what's

542
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,400
happening in these cells or is that

543
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,120
right? Yeah. You can you can peek into

544
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,360
the microscopic details of what's

545
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,280
happening in a tumor. What we learned in

546
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,480
the animal experiments with the quantum

547
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,679
dots really fed into the design of what

548
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,640
we used in what we used in humans.

549
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,960
So it's good to remember that the time

550
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,880
scale from discovery to an application

551
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,440
is really long, you know, decades. The

552
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,840
average

553
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,080
um gap between the discovery, the

554
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,360
invention and the awarding of the Nobel

555
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,320
Prize on average is 30

556
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:43,120
years. It just takes time for the impact

557
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,799
to be seen. There's so much work that

558
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,799
goes from the initial idea and the

559
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,840
discovery to getting something that's

560
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,640
actually working well that society can

561
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,760
use, you know, dayto-day. So when you

562
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,280
think down the road about the work that

563
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,440
you've done and you think about clean

564
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,159
energy and energy efficiency, which is I

565
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,480
know very important to you, where do you

566
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,400
think like that biggest impact of your

567
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,320
work will ultimately be felt even if it

568
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,320
isn't felt yet?

569
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,159
I mean there are two answers to that.

570
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,520
One of them is I have no idea.

571
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,880
Good answer. So humans are pretty good

572
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,640
at looking three years ahead. They're

573
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,159
really terrible at looking 20 years

574
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,720
ahead. We just have no idea what's the

575
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,480
world be like technologically 20 years

576
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,240
from now. If you look back, you know, 20

577
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,679
years ago,

578
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
we were just wrong about most

579
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,559
everything. Right. Right.

580
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,960
So it's really hard to know for sure. So

581
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,760
but I can tell you in the next 3 to 5

582
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,200
years I think this

583
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,919
downshifting business maybe in

584
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,159
agriculture or in increasing the

585
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,799
efficiency of solar maybe in 5 to 10

586
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,360
years maybe that will have an impact. So

587
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,840
the one the sort of films of in a

588
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,360
greenhouse of filtering out the light

589
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
that the plants don't like and so

590
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,120
increasing yields that way. Increasing

591
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,799
yields that way and then and then maybe

592
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,000
in a few years that there will be a real

593
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,400
impact on the efficiency of solar. Yes.

594
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,559
It sounds like I mean I I don't have a

595
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,120
good sense Rob. I'm sure you've seen a

596
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,200
million efforts to do solar. You were

597
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,520
talking about like it being 20%

598
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,480
efficient and maybe quantum dots taking

599
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,720
it to 22 or something. I know this is a

600
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,039
silly question, but what where's like

601
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,799
the 50% or the come on?

602
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,600
I think there's like a long way between

603
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,880
20 and 100, but I'm not sure. Yeah. No,

604
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
but people are working on that. Those

605
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,320
are those would be tendon cells where

606
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,320
you have multiple PV cells that absorb

607
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,640
different parts of the spectrum. Okay.

608
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,159
And then you can raise that to the 40%

609
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,000
range, which would be just, you know,

610
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,520
incredible, right? That isn't

611
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,400
necessarily quantum dots. Not

612
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,240
necessarily quantum dots. Offsky. That's

613
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,200
that's part of my research actually you

614
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,480
know taking silicon and adding on top of

615
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,279
silicon a thin film of these materials

616
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,320
called perovsky thin film solar

617
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,520
which is what um these are thin films of

618
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,679
this um material that you can make

619
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,159
essentially in one step with earth

620
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,720
abundant materials near room

621
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,919
temperature. So it's really inexpensive

622
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,080
and easy to make. You can add on

623
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,400
principle on top of a silicon cell and

624
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,679
raise it from 20% to 30%. It's been

625
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,600
demonstrated above 33% now and there's

626
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,679
no reason why it couldn't be in the 40%

627
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
range theoretically. These are also sort

628
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,840
of tunable materials in the sense that

629
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,559
you can you can modify their properties

630
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,440
in order to capture a particular part of

631
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,279
the solar spectrum. Yeah. So that's part

632
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,120
that's why I don't work on quantum dots

633
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,840
for solar in that business anymore

634
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,840
because the sparovski have taken over.

635
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,000
They're much cheaper, much easier to

636
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,159
make from a cost perspective. They're

637
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,279
just as

638
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:02,279
tunable and they could be maybe in 10

639
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,600
years you could start seeing real tandem

640
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:08,640
cells that would be in utility grade

641
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,919
applications. you know solar fields

642
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,159
where you're getting 28% 30% power

643
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,960
converting efficiency real real increase

644
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,000
seems like a game changer I 50% increase

645
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,360
in that would be a game changer yes so

646
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,799
the issue with those materials is the

647
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,880
stability how long do you need it to be

648
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,720
because if it's inexpensive enough maybe

649
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,679
you can just replace that part every 10

650
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,440
years and keep the silicon under it but

651
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,640
that replacement is going to require

652
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,559
labor so that's going to be a cost. So

653
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,080
the economics of it are not completely

654
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,320
clear. I mean it would be best if they

655
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,480
could last 30 years and so the whole

656
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,159
thing lasts 30 years and the big company

657
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,200
the big solar companies are all working

658
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,720
on this because they see they think that

659
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
this could be really important for the

660
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,440
future. Got it. And so they're putting

661
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,840
in hundreds of millions of dollars into

662
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,919
that

663
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,919
space and they may at some point start

664
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,760
gobbling up the startups for their

665
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,520
technology which is a good thing. Which

666
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,400
is absolutely a good thing. Absolutely a

667
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,159
good thing. So what if it works? I mean

668
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,159
solar panels get what? Cheaper maybe for

669
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,039
for every watt of electricity they

670
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,640
produce. Yeah, they maybe get smaller.

671
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,720
Smaller or cheaper? It depends on the

672
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,640
application. I think for perovskite I

673
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,360
think the solar fields is the right

674
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,600
application for them. You know people

675
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,480
talk about

676
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,400
flexible PVs that are ubiquitous etc.

677
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,120
I'm not sure that peroskites are going

678
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,840
to be able to do that for the one reason

679
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,840
is that they contain lead and that's

680
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,000
going to be a lead. Lead. Yeah, that's a

681
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,200
non-starter I think for anything that's

682
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,360
um consumer related. Okay. But for solar

683
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,840
fields, there was plenty of lead in

684
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,919
silicon big silicon panels out there and

685
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,919
cadmium tally is a big material for

686
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,880
solar fields and it's contained and it's

687
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,880
recycled and it's not going anywhere and

688
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,279
it's not a problem. It's kind of like

689
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,840
you have a differentiated marketplace in

690
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,760
in vehicles, right? Just because you

691
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,559
might put a certain kind of fuel in like

692
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,000
a big rig doesn't mean that's what you

693
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,840
put in your little car. I mean, it

694
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,480
sounds like, you know, the solar panels

695
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,559
you might put on your house on the side

696
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,399
that faces the sun is not necessarily

697
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,360
what you would have in like a huge

698
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:26,720
industrial solar field. Yeah. Yeah.

699
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,600
So when you think about your own views

700
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,240
about clean energy, where are you in

701
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,240
terms of optimism, pessimism, how you

702
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,080
think about our journey towards clean

703
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,120
energy? Oh, in terms of the technology,

704
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,039
I'm quite optimistic. Yeah. For two

705
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,520
reasons. One of them, we already have

706
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,679
the tools today. Silicon works

707
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,080
incredibly well. Wind power works

708
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,159
incredibly well. They scale up. You look

709
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,679
at the cost. I mean Swanson's law again,

710
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,600
you know, 20% lower cost every double of

711
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,159
production. You just follow the line

712
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,919
down and it crossed fossil fuel in most

713
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,640
part of the worlds already and you keep

714
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,640
falling down and there's really no real

715
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,559
reason why suddenly it should saturate

716
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,440
and say stop falling down. It's just

717
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,960
such a mature technology. So just from

718
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,080
that perspective, it's incredibly

719
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,679
optimistic. And then all these add-ons,

720
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,840
all these other technologies that are

721
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,559
coming on board, we don't need all of

722
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,360
them to work. We just need a fraction of

723
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,600
them to

724
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,720
succeed. In the end, it's policy. You

725
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,640
know, are we going to use the

726
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,360
technologies we have or that we create

727
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,840
or are we just going to it becomes

728
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,440
policy? It becomes politics. The problem

729
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,640
is that um in terms of basic science

730
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,919
when we are at the beginning of

731
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,919
discovery the support for that has been

732
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,039
less and less over the last 30 years

733
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,600
independent of what field it is. Um just

734
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,360
this is just the NSF doesn't get as much

735
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,520
money as it should. Is that the

736
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,000
situation or Yeah. The budget of the NSF

737
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,679
has not followed inflation by any means

738
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,720
over the last 30 years. You know what

739
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,679
could fund research from an NSF grant

740
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,200
when I started

741
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:09,440
is what we get now is about a quarter of

742
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,720
what we used to get in terms of real

743
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,279
dollars. Wow. It's really I mean I

744
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,080
talked to my colleagues all over the US

745
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,760
and we think that you know we could do

746
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,720
what we could do before but now we're at

747
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,559
a it's really critical now. It's not

748
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,440
sustainable and that's was the beauty of

749
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,720
Bell Labs. It allowed people to really

750
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,960
explore with with little accountability,

751
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,559
right? It was trust. Trust that, you

752
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,640
know, you guys are really smart. You

753
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,159
think of really hard problems. We trust

754
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,240
you that you're going to come up with

755
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,440
something interesting. I think in the

756
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,440
early 60s, the government spent like 2%

757
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,360
of the budget on science and research. I

758
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,919
mean, this was like part a lot of it was

759
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,520
to get to the moon. You know, when you

760
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,440
talk about the heyday, that all sorts of

761
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,799
ripple effects out. And I don't think

762
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,960
it's anything close to No. Right. Yeah.

763
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,480
A couple percentage points now. And if

764
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,919
you think that it takes 20 or 30 years

765
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,840
to reap the benefits of that

766
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,399
investment, you know, 1960 plus 30 is

767
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,440
1990. And yeah, we're not feeling the

768
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,039
pain. We're not we're not we're not

769
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,480
replenishing our pipeline of basic

770
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,200
discoveries are going to change the

771
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,440
world, right? Do you think it can shift

772
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,720
to the private sector? I mean, a lot of

773
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,399
the work That's an argument that I've

774
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,039
heard. Yeah, I've heard that argument

775
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,279
and maybe in biotech there's a lot of

776
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,360
research going on today that is more

777
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,880
basic than is you know there's a lot of

778
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,600
money in biotech and they're doing

779
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,760
really amazing things. I don't think the

780
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,760
private sector has the timeline that is

781
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,039
needed for basic research. It's just not

782
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,799
in the cards. Bell Labs was an anomaly.

783
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,960
Bell Labs was anomal because it was

784
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,679
funded by AT&T which had a monopoly on

785
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,120
the long-distance network and was just

786
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,320
making money right and left and uh and

787
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,240
had the ability to do that to really do

788
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,240
that. And when the monopoly was broken,

789
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Bell Labs disappeared. The other big

790
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,240
monopoly around that time was IBM's

791
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,320
monopoly in the large computer business.

792
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,840
Exactly. Pieces and the Yorktown Heights

793
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,200
was was an example of the amount of

794
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,519
research that came out. It's just

795
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,960
amazing. Yeah. And it's also, you know,

796
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,200
faded away.

797
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,039
Yeah, it's pretty much all gone. And

798
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,840
when the big oil companies, you know,

799
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,679
really were making a lot of money like

800
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,240
um

801
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,159
Exxon, Exxon had a research lab where

802
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,120
they studied the fluid dynamics and all

803
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,399
sorts of things. Very really active

804
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,399
place that's pretty much disappeared as

805
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,519
well. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, you know,

806
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,760
the the the oil and gas companies still

807
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,640
do fund a lot of university research. I

808
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,240
mean it's not necessarily um received

809
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,159
graciously or gratefully um in some

810
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,679
quarters but you know I'm just recalling

811
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,480
that they have funded a great deal of

812
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,799
solar research at MIT

813
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,080
very active in um plasma science and in

814
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,559
fusion research and other areas I think

815
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,880
they see I mean they they are used to

816
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,559
looking at long time scales when you

817
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,159
develop an oil field it takes decades

818
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,159
from the initial fine to developing.

819
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,159
You're talking about 30 years, right?

820
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,880
And so they're used to really long time

821
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,320
scales and they see their business 40

822
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,640
years from now. What is it going to look

823
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,120
like? It's going to be really different.

824
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,159
So they know they have to switch. Yeah.

825
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:31,399
And there parts of them are funding

826
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,399
things that could allow them to switch.

827
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,039
Munchupendi is professor of chemistry at

828
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,360
MIT. He's also the winner of the 2023

829
