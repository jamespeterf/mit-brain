questions I will moderate on your behalf

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,880
and ask the questions uh thank you for

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,400
joining us and we're very excited to

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,400
listen to your talk

32
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,240
thank you forage for the nice

33
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,079
introduction uh it's a pleasure to be

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,840
here and uh talking to all of you about

35
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,759
our uh some of our most recent work on

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,880
uh as you can see from the title the AI

37
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,759
for 2D materials and 2D materials for Ai

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,880
and I will see you know a reason for me

39
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,360
to come up with this particular uh title

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,479
but before I go into the technical part

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,360
of the talk uh maybe a little bit about

42
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,280
myself um uh I did my um all my

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,879
schooling uh back in India uh I grown up

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,560
in a town called Kolkata which is in the

45
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,879
eastern part of India uh then I did my

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,080
undergraduate also from India in jadur

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,879
University in electronics and

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,280
telecommunication before coming to the

49
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,360
United States to do my PhD from puru uh

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
and after that I spent couple of years

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
in the Argon National Lab as a

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,319
postdoctoral scholar and as an assistant

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,879
scientist and then I kind of joined pen

54
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,319
as a tenure track faculty I have been

55
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,800
there for almost 8 and a half years now

56
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,879
um I would also like to acknowledge all

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,800
my funding agencies uh uh and uh

58
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,519
definitely all my students who are doing

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,120
all the hard work uh uh and really an

60
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,840
amazing group of you know motivated

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,080
students who uh you know kind of are the

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,440
main pillar of you know whatever uh

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,360
success that comes to the group um so my

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,360
group has the focus of looking into

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,560
neuromorphic or brain inspired Computing

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,280
uh that's like you know one of the

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,159
fundamental principle that drives our

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,080
group and we use mostly 2D materials for

69
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,440
that uh although a lot of principles

70
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,239
that we are using can be also applied to

71
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,200
oxide based transistors and even you

72
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,840
know paros materials but our Focus has

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,440
been 2D materials and I will tell you

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,799
you know some of the key advantages of

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,439
2D materials so uh we also look into you

76
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,720
know specific C found in animal brains I

77
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,200
will give you a couple of examples today

78
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,599
so we designed this brain inspired

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,000
circuits so and you know more recently

80
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,360
we have started looking into 3D

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,239
integration with the you know uh the

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
idea that you know brain ultimately is a

83
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,239
three-dimensional structure and if we

84
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
can do computation in the

85
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,840
three-dimensional architecture you know

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,599
it can actually bring a lot of Energy

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,599
Efficiency uh to to the uh Computing and

88
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,400
then finally you know we also look into

89
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,400
machine learning uh of course one of our

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
idea is to make the next generation of

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
artificial neural network deep neural

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,720
networks energy efficient because

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,079
they're not at the sustainable path but

94
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,000
we also use their power in order to kind

95
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,560
of mitigate some of the challenges with

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,640
the 2D materials and that is the part I

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,079
call you know the AI for 2D materials

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,079
and today's talk will actually start

99
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,600
with that aspect how do we use the AI to

100
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,680
kind of uh uh enhance the performance uh

101
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,440
of a 2d material based sensor in this

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,080
case we call it a graphine tongue uh

103
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,080
which is used for you know you know kind

104
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,400
of robust chemical analysis of course

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,479
the tongue doesn't look like this this

106
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,080
is again AI generated by Chad GPT um the

107
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,440
tongue looks much simpler and not that

108
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,240
uh exciting over there this is like

109
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,199
simple graphine transistors you know

110
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,800
very small you know even smaller than

111
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,080
probably a quarter uh uh and we use this

112
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,600
particular you know graphine device for

113
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,919
a specific application uh which is you

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,039
know related to you know really food

115
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,720
because food is a very complex chemical

116
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,039
you know if you think about the juices

117
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,160
you know the milk you know whatever we

118
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,320
eat is actually a very complex chemical

119
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,039
so analyzing those chemicals using this

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,320
platform gives us a little bit

121
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,960
confidence about the power of both

122
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,960
machine learning and the hardware piece

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,240
that we are

124
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,080
developing now when it comes to food you

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
know I think the inspiration comes from

126
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,440
you know the best sensor out there for

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
food which is probably our tongue right

128
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,440
and the tongue is kind of quite

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,600
interesting because if you think about

130
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,360
the test receptors in the tongue there

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,440
are only five different types of test

132
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,440
receptors which can broadly categorize

133
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,680
you know sweet shower you know bitter

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,479
Umami which is a taste of meat and salty

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,440
right but if you think about the tongue

136
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,960
in general we can figure out the

137
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,400
difference between a chocolate cake and

138
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,160
a cheesecake both being sweet right or

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
you know if you train your tongue then

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,479
it can also differentiate between very

141
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,160
shuttle differences between different

142
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,319
types of wine right so so although our

143
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,199
test receptors the hardware piece is

144
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,680
very limited the gustatory cortex is

145
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,960
actually pretty elaborate which helps us

146
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
to kind of get you know more ideas about

147
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,160
you know similar types of

148
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,360
chemical one more important thing you

149
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,599
know what we kind of got very motivated

150
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,560
about is the fact that you know in the

151
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:16,440
animal kingdom no two tongues are

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,120
identical you know I think my tongue and

153
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,919
your tongue are completely different but

154
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,080
if we are given a pork or a chicken to

155
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,720
eat both of us if we are meat eater

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,440
we'll be able to tell what is a pork and

157
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,720
what is a meat right so in spite of

158
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,400
differences between the tongues which is

159
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,800
the variation from from one device to

160
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,080
the other one Hardware piece to the

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,639
other we can categorize the same you

162
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,120
know thing that we are eating and this

163
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,720
is kind of going to be very important

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,759
going forward because most of the

165
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,680
nanomaterial based sensors do not really

166
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,199
make it to the commercialization because

167
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,680
of this problem of variation right

168
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,120
device to device cycle to cycle so the

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,800
question is since the nature can do it

170
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,240
can we adopt the same principle for our

171
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,280
chemi sensors as well now there is one

172
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,039
more important piece about the tongue

173
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,960
right the question is whether human

174
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,280
beings have the best tongue or not what

175
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,680
differentiate you know two different

176
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,039
tongues in the Kingdom Animal Kingdom so

177
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,280
the five types of test receptor is

178
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,560
common across all the tongues but there

179
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,960
are also number of test receptors that

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,440
matters and if you look into a chicken

181
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,160
the chicken has got only 25 total test

182
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
receptors although there are like all

183
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,520
five types okay so five of each so this

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,039
is not the best tongue of course the

185
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
chicken only feds on very limited kind

186
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,199
of food right the the cat has

187
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,479
400 the dog has got

188
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,000
2,000 human has got 10,000 but the

189
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,440
question is are we the best tongue out

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,639
there and the answer is no the best

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,960
tongue is actually a catfish the catfish

192
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,440
has got 200,000 test receptors and its

193
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,960
entire body is actually test receptor

194
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,960
and what it allows it to do is to find

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,840
out very small changes in the underwater

196
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,159
aquatic environment to find a predatory

197
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,840
action you you know because aquatic

198
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,319
environment is chemically extremely

199
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,919
chaotic and yet it can get a very high

200
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,720
sensitivity and selectivity because of

201
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,639
the large number of test receptors it

202
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,120
has got which is nothing but having a

203
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,599
lot of information from the same

204
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,360
environment so more test receptors

205
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,960
allows you to collect you know more

206
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,800
information so now we kind of look into

207
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,520
the same principle and design our

208
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,240
graphine based electronic tongue which

209
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,879
is simple graphine transistors and one

210
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,000
thing which is quite interesting about

211
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,919
graphine is once you put a liquid on top

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,120
of this graphine there is this electric

213
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,279
double layer that forms at the interface

214
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,919
and that carries the chemical signature

215
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,719
of the species that you're putting on

216
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,560
top and that then get translated into

217
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,080
the IV characteristics of graphine I'm

218
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,440
pretty sure that you have all seen this

219
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,519
kind of graphine

220
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,040
characteristics uh and then as I will

221
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,880
tell you you know we use this entire

222
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,040
machine learning in order to kind of

223
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,839
analyze this entire IV characteristics

224
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,480
to identify different chemicals now let

225
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,760
me state to the problem with this

226
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,360
graphine chemi sensor so here I have a

227
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,440
single graphine device and we do pH

228
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,560
sensing and you can see wonderful nice

229
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,360
results for each pH the characteristics

230
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,480
is distinct and therefore we can say

231
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,320
that we have made a amazing pH sensor

232
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,480
okay and this work has been going on for

233
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,160
a long time you know but the problem in

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,079
next day you know if you measure the

235
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,079
same device okay the device

236
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,399
characteristics has drifted a little bit

237
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,680
so your sensitivity has now gone down

238
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,279
and if you measured it with a acoss

239
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,200
multiple different sensors that you have

240
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,399
fabricated you have even more device to

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,240
device variation and now you can see

242
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,839
that between ph45 and six everything

243
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,079
appears to be the same so if I give an

244
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
unknown solution right and if you

245
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,000
measure it you measure a direct point

246
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,959
you won't be able to tell whether it is

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,800
ph4 or five so we lost our sensitivity

248
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,040
to the fact that there's a lot of device

249
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,560
to device cycle to cycle manufacturing

250
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,600
to manufacturing variation the question

251
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,959
is now how can we mitigate that now one

252
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,000
question we could ask is that should we

253
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,959
look into the direct point you know as

254
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,320
our indicator of a change in the

255
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,880
chemical solution or should we look into

256
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,440
some of the other parameters there's a

257
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,600
huge list of parameters that you can

258
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,680
extract right the minimum current the

259
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,000
maximum current the onoff ratio because

260
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,360
it's a transistor so you can really

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,600
extract a lot of information but even if

262
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,440
I do that and look into you know how

263
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,720
each of this parameter kind of changes

264
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,640
as a function of you know all this

265
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,920
device to device variation I can

266
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,920
probably go ahead and rank them and I

267
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,560
can find that oh okay V has the rank

268
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,720
five but ID is rank one and you know

269
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,839
that's good but then even with the first

270
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,440
rank you know figure of Merit I don't

271
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,320
get to 100% accuracy because it is still

272
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,839
drifting okay now what we could do is we

273
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,200
could do some very simple machine

274
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,399
learning where we say that okay instead

275
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,800
of looking into one parameter at a time

276
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,360
why don't we combine you know three

277
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,160
different quantities let's say the top

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,399
three and there you see that you know

279
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,360
you get you know clustering of the data

280
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,760
this is K nearest never algorithm and

281
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,399
you get to you know almost 100% accuracy

282
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,279
once you get you know five different

283
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,959
parameters that you look into at the

284
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,200
same time but the question is you know

285
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,240
here all these parameters that we are

286
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,360
extracting are based on human derived

287
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,560
knowledge right but are we the best to

288
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
you know extract information from you

289
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,880
know a data set so what we did is you

290
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,040
know we kind of thought about instead of

291
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,800
you know extracting this D Point minimum

292
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,800
current ourselves why don't we give the

293
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,440
entire IV characteristics to the

294
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,839
convolution neural network which is

295
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,200
generally very good in order to

296
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,600
features and then see you know whether

297
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,120
it can classify the different PHS or not

298
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,079
and you can see immediately the accuracy

299
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,880
goes to 98% without us going into all

300
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,440
this elaborate exercise of finding out

301
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,000
which are the best figure of merits

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
right and this is in spite of having

303
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,079
those device to device and sensor to

304
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,240
sensor and time to time cycle to cycle

305
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,959
variation right so now this is all good

306
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,120
but when the question that we ask is

307
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,200
that okay we all know artificial neural

308
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,880
network or black boxes they perform very

309
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,440
well but we never know why do they

310
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,399
perform very well so then we looked into

311
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,680
things called these shapely features to

312
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,720
identify which part of the graphine

313
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,120
characteristics the network is focusing

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,600
on in order to really do such an amazing

315
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
job in terms of being a pH sensor and

316
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,639
what we found is that if you can compare

317
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,240
you know the ph4 you see that these blue

318
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,199
regions are all activated for ph4 while

319
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,079
other regions are activated for

320
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,839
different pH values which means that the

321
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,399
network is not looking into a single

322
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,680
parameter but into a part of this IV

323
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,279
characteristics in a very shuttle manner

324
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,240
because the weight for each of these

325
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,399
point is different and there is no

326
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,360
mathematical definition of you know how

327
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,360
do I describe a part of these

328
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,120
characteristics and this is precisely

329
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,519
why the network works so much better

330
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,320
because it looks into very shuttle

331
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,480
changes in the IV characteristics which

332
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,720
is beyond mathematical description right

333
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,480
so we get a very high accuracy because

334
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,519
of you know this this interesting aspect

335
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,800
and you can do is you can actually take

336
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,800
you know three4 chip train it the device

337
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,199
on those and then test it on a

338
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,040
completely newly fabricated chip and

339
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:08,399
still you get very high accuracy number

340
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,160
which means that you know you don't have

341
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,880
to make billions of chips and on each

342
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,959
chip you have to do separate training

343
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,880
right then then it will not be

344
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,959
commercializable so that's also very

345
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
good that you can do the training uh uh

346
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,040
on a different chip and then testing on

347
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,760
the other then we thought about okay pH

348
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,639
is a very simple topic right because the

349
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,959
pH gives you really observable changes

350
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,560
in the IV characteristics but what about

351
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,959
milk and adulterating it with water

352
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,160
because when you adulterate milk with

353
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,880
water the PH does not change so if you

354
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,440
have a pH sensor you will not be able to

355
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,320
detect adulteration of milk but then

356
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,720
what we did is we did the same principle

357
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,959
we measured a lot of device with

358
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,199
different milk adulteration percentage

359
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,240
and then you know train the machine

360
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,959
learning model and look at the accuracy

361
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
of it being telling you what is the

362
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,440
adulteration percentage now adulation

363
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,079
percentage is not really a

364
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
classification problem it's more of a

365
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,199
regression problem because you don't

366
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,800
know whether you will be adult rating

367
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:06,240
with 10% or 20% or 3. 5% of water and

368
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
then we also trained a regression based

369
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,680
model and we found that still it gives

370
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,320
you an accuracy within 2 to 3% of milk

371
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,240
adulteration right the same principle

372
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,680
and you can actually expand it to you

373
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,040
know different Coke of coffee you know

374
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,600
milk and one thing you notice is that

375
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,160
it's the same exact Raffine device

376
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,720
without any functionalization because

377
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,720
generally when we try to develop a

378
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,199
sensor for milk we need to know what in

379
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,720
milk makes it milk and then go ahead and

380
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,199
functionalize your graphine device or

381
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,639
what in Coke makes it Coke and

382
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:38,959
functionalize we are not functionalizing

383
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,560
this we are simply collecting a lot of

384
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,600
data from many different graphine

385
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,360
sensors and then training the model and

386
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,759
telling them this is scog versus this is

387
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,120
uh you know zero sugar versus Pepsi

388
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,040
right because these are chemically very

389
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,560
similar right and yet the network is

390
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,680
able to learn and

391
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,040
distinguish and does a very very good

392
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,639
job in there okay and then we look into

393
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,880
even more deeper problems let's say for

394
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,920
example different fruit juices and as

395
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,639
they degrade over time because now it is

396
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,759
just not the juice but also the

397
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,399
different bacterial or fungi activity

398
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,120
because the the reason a juice degrade

399
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,480
is different for different juices right

400
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,279
orange juice May degrade because of

401
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,600
oxidation processes but you know

402
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,399
pineapple juice May degress because

403
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,079
there might be more fungi activity

404
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,720
happening so if you really need to know

405
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,040
whether a juice is two day old or three

406
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,240
day old first you need to know the the

407
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,160
chemistry that goes on in degrading that

408
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,759
fruit juice and then try to kind of

409
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,759
Target that particular molecule and then

410
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,560
figure out whether it is degraded or not

411
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,040
we are not doing anything like that we

412
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,959
are simply collecting data from

413
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,839
different juices over different days and

414
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,279
training the machine learning model we

415
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,560
use a different types of network

416
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,680
architecture and then it can tell you

417
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,480
you know whether what juice it is and

418
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,079
also you know how old it is right so

419
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,360
this is where I feel like the power of

420
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,800
artificial neural network can really

421
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,600
mitigate a lot of real life problem with

422
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,279
all the Nano sensors that we are

423
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,720
developing because now I don't really

424
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,360
need to make the perfect sensor I can

425
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,040
deal with imperfection by taking help

426
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,279
from this neural network right this is

427
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,959
the part where I kind of say that AI can

428
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,639
be useful for 2D material so now I will

429
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,839
switch gear so this is the AI for 2D

430
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,279
material if you're interested you can

431
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,079
you know go and read our paper we just

432
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,720
published this a few months back uh now

433
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm going to 2D materials for AI right

434
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,920
and in this context as I told you that

435
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,720
you know we are uh not only looking into

436
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,880
synapses and neurons that's how you know

437
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,639
the basic abstract of artificial neural

438
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,680
network is but we are focusing on the

439
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,279
unique architecture found in different

440
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,399
animal brains because these animals are

441
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,000
really very good in sensory computation

442
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:48,959
and I'm going to give you couple of

443
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,040
example the first example is this Locust

444
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,880
uh and Locust you know fly in a swarm

445
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
and a single swarm can consist up to a

446
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,440
million Locust they all fly together but

447
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,319
never collide with each other right so

448
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,399
they are really naturally avoiding

449
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,959
Collision so therefore we can really and

450
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,319
and there's a single neuron in the brain

451
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,720
of the Locust which is called this

452
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,160
lobula giant movement detector neuron

453
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,959
which actually helps it to avoid

454
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,720
Collision right so a single neuron is

455
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,120
avoiding collision and that's what makes

456
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,360
it extremely energy efficient right and

457
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,439
we have flying drones autonomous cars we

458
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,959
have you know uh collision avoidance

459
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,640
systems today but they're very bulky

460
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,640
energy and efficient so can we learn

461
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
from Locust and design something for

462
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,959
collision avoidance so now let's see you

463
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,039
know what the Locust does in order to

464
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,480
avoid Collision so it has a compound eye

465
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,760
you can see that those photo receptor

466
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,000
cells so whenever an object approaches

467
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,280
the Locust eye it uses two kind of

468
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,559
stimulus one is the angular projection

469
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,480
which is Theta which increases as the

470
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,360
object comes closer and the other is the

471
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,200
angular velocity which is Theta Prime

472
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,840
which is just the differential of the

473
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,039
same information now this D now this

474
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,720
lgmd neuron has got two branches as you

475
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,679
can see the blue dendritic branch takes

476
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,799
the angular velocity information and

477
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,840
creates an Exciter response which means

478
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,919
that as the object comes closer the

479
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,360
response increases which is quite

480
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,280
natural but what the Red dritic Branch

481
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,080
does is quite interesting because it

482
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,960
takes the angular projection information

483
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,200
which also increases as the object comes

484
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,799
closer but it creates an inhibitory

485
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,200
response look at the red curve so the

486
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,080
response goes down as the object comes

487
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
closer and that is counterintuitive you

488
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,720
know why would a response go down when

489
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,880
something is about to collide with you

490
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,039
then what the lgmd neuron does it kind

491
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,320
of multiplies the two and creates a non-

492
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:33,640
monoton firing sequence where the firing

493
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,559
frequency becomes maximum right before

494
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,840
the Collision is going to take place and

495
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,120
that gives the Locust enough time to fly

496
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,240
out in a different direction right so

497
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,000
you can see it's a very simple

498
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,760
architecture so we thought about okay

499
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,440
why don't we go and simply you know

500
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,720
mimic this architecture so we kind of

501
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,360
did that and I'm going to go through

502
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,159
this so we created this inhibitory

503
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,320
module excitory module and the Escape

504
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,559
module using our 2D material based

505
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,520
devices so so let's say for example we

506
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,120
have a car and the car is approaching

507
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,679
your sensor and as the car comes closer

508
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,440
the intensity of the headlight that is

509
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,480
you know falling on the sensor is going

510
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,039
to increase and you can see over here if

511
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,600
the car is moving faster then the

512
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,760
intensity go high earlier if the cars

513
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,720
are moving slower the intensity will go

514
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,320
higher later right but this information

515
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,200
alone is not good enough for you to

516
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,480
avoid Collision because it's a monotonic

517
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,640
information so what we do is we actually

518
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,200
used a circuit which is kind of inspired

519
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,919
by the locus but walks in a very

520
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,919
different principle so this if you can

521
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,440
recollect it's a inverter okay which

522
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,240
means that you know if if your input is

523
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,840
low the output is high and if your

524
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,400
output is high the input is low it's

525
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,320
just an inverter and generally a seos

526
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,200
inverter will not respond to light if

527
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,520
you shine light on a simos inverter it

528
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,960
will remain the same right as long as

529
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,080
you're not changing the biasing

530
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,880
condition to that inverter but now this

531
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,000
inverter is very special because it has

532
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,159
got this mos2 transistor in the bottom

533
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,440
right and this mos2 transistor re

534
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,480
responds to light and whenever you shine

535
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
light on this MOS it's a direct band Gap

536
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,919
material you have photogenerated

537
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,960
carriers electron hold Pairs and then

538
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,760
this holes get strapped into the

539
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,240
underlying oxide and that changes the

540
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,679
threshold voltage of the mos2 transistor

541
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,200
now as the threshold voltage of this

542
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,679
lower transistor is changing so will be

543
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,760
the inverter response you know in a

544
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,480
static condition just by Shining Light

545
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,320
the inverter response keeps changing and

546
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,799
as you keep shining it the invert you

547
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,919
know you can see that the response is

548
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,880
going towards the left so after some

549
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,480
time the state of the inverter changes

550
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,640
from high to low as a threshold

551
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,039
crossovers so this is almost very simp

552
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,480
similar to an inhibitory response

553
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,640
although the light intensity is

554
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,159
increasing the response of your device

555
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,799
is initially high and later low and

556
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,080
based on how fast the car is appearing

557
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,200
or approaching you get a earlier versus

558
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,440
a late response so now we have created

559
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,679
the inhibition we still have to create

560
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,039
the Exciter response so how do we do

561
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,400
that you just cascet two inverters the

562
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,039
inverse of a inverse will give you now

563
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,760
it's a buffer circuit and if you shine

564
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:00,000
light on the same thing now it will

565
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,320
create an excit response where the

566
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,919
response is low initially and eventually

567
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,440
becomes high as the light comes closer

568
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,720
and closer so now I got both inhibition

569
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,960
and excitation the final job is to

570
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,960
multiply the two and that's easy I

571
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,600
simply use an and gate because and gate

572
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,679
is a logical multiplier and if I do that

573
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,000
I get the spike and the spike happens

574
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,320
earlier for a faster moving car and

575
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,159
later for a slower moving car so it's

576
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,559
kind of using the same algorithm that

577
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:31,919
the Locust uses but designing it using

578
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:35,320
all solid St devices using in sensor

579
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,279
Computing capability to get to very low

580
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,120
Power Collision of ir system right so

581
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,520
that's one example where we can actually

582
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,640
learn from nature now let's look into

583
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,559
the second example the second example

584
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,360
going from Vision to hearing so here we

585
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
are looking into know burn o because

586
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,279
this is one of the uh you know you know

587
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,520
burn o hunts in complete darkness so it

588
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,080
relies not on his eyes but on its

589
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,120
hearing capability to find a

590
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,240
you know or or even I mean escape from

591
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,960
the Predators um but you know the reason

592
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,120
you know it can localize sound with the

593
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,039
Precision of almost 1 to 3 degree and I

594
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,640
do not know I mean I kind of got excited

595
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,279
about our years after you know learning

596
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,200
about barow is that know why do we have

597
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,159
two years why not one for hearing you

598
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,600
know and one thing that is true about

599
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,159
having two years is that you know

600
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,080
whenever a sound approaches from a

601
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,760
particular direction it reaches the 2

602
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,159
years with a certain time Gap you know

603
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,000
for example if the sound is coming from

604
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,880
right it will reach your right ear first

605
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,720
and the left ear later so there's a

606
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,080
finite time difference between the time

607
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
reaching your two years now the problem

608
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,320
is this time difference is generally of

609
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,320
the order of hundreds of microc for bar

610
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,039
which is a smaller head to maybe a

611
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,720
millisecond for elephant which has a

612
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,279
bigger head right because the velocity

613
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,799
of sound is pretty fast right and our

614
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,400
head is too small so now you're are

615
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,440
trying to solve you know this temporal

616
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,400
problem which is in hundreds of microc

617
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,400
using neurons which can only fire every

618
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,480
few millisecond right that's a very

619
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,880
difficult computational problem to solve

620
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,760
so how do we do it you actually convert

621
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,679
or use a neural architecture that

622
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,440
converts the temporal information into a

623
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,279
spatial map so how does it do it it has

624
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,000
this you know uh organization of neurons

625
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,480
it uses two types of neuron these red

626
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,159
neurons are called The Coincidence

627
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,559
neuron you know they kind of fire every

628
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,159
time they receive the information from

629
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,679
the top and bottom neuron at the same

630
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,440
time while the black ones are called the

631
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,039
delay neurons they simply convert the

632
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,640
acustic information into electrical

633
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,120
spikes and brings it to the uh you know

634
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,760
the delay neuron so let's look into this

635
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,720
demonstration now let's say for example

636
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,960
the sound is coming from Straight Ahead

637
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,720
it will reach both ears at the same time

638
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,120
and it will propagate the same distance

639
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,080
and The Coincidence will occur at the

640
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,400
middle but if the sound comes from the

641
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,840
right side then it will reach the right

642
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,880
ear first there will be longer

643
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,480
propagation in the branch below and

644
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,480
shorter in the top and therefore the

645
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,840
coincidence will happen at a different

646
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,360
location so so just by knowing where did

647
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,480
The Coincidence took place you can tell

648
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,600
which direction the sound came from

649
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,320
right it's a very interesting

650
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,960
architecture to do sound localization we

651
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
actually went ahead and did that but in

652
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,320
this particular case we use a special

653
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,480
transistor uh which we call a split GED

654
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,200
transistor uh which does not have only

655
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,720
one gate but it has multiple Gates and

656
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,279
there is a small gap between the gates

657
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,320
and you can see there are you know many

658
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,120
gates in this transistor so what happens

659
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,880
is that you know this transistor could

660
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,919
only be turned off

661
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,919
if you have the voltages applied to the

662
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,480
same color gate at the same time so the

663
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,240
top and bottom electrodes work as a

664
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,159
coincidence neuron okay but at the same

665
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,880
time you can see there is a small gap

666
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,520
between these top and bottom electrodes

667
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,480
which means you can never completely

668
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,200
turn off the transistor right because

669
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,200
there's a small gap which is not under

670
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,240
gate

671
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,000
control so but you can see that for the

672
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,840
blue one I can turn it off better

673
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,520
compared to the green one because of the

674
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,000
fringing electric field right so what

675
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,000
happens is that you know whenever you

676
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,200
get the spikes at the same top and

677
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,600
bottom neuron there is a drop in the

678
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,399
current right but the magnitude of the

679
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,840
drop depends upon which color this

680
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:17,320
coincidence took place so this is almost

681
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,919
like a mixed signal device which does

682
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,960
digital computation in the vertical

683
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,279
Direction and analog computation in the

684
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,760
horizontal direction to mimic the

685
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,760
architecture found in the bar O's brain

686
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,720
and with that we can now get to you know

687
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,080
very high High Precision in these

688
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,399
devices okay we can get down to almost

689
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,600
like you know 0.01 degree precision and

690
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,840
we are also not restricted to acustic

691
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,399
wave you can use the entire

692
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,440
electromagnetic you know radiation

693
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,080
spectrum because you just need the right

694
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,799
transducer to convert that into

695
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,240
electrical spikes and then use the

696
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,840
architecture for

697
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,200
detecting so this is another example now

698
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,960
I will uh switch gear a little bit so we

699
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,559
do a lot of these animals you know for

700
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,159
example we look into octopus for

701
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,440
multisensory integration if you're

702
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,840
interested you can look into this paper

703
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,480
uh we also look into you know uh

704
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,919
dragonfly for probabilistic computing

705
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,600
you know we have done a lot of work

706
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,760
using 2D materials to get you know all

707
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,679
these goian characteristics you know

708
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,279
stochastic Computing you know uh and and

709
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,600
in in many computational problem we

710
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,600
don't need an accurate solution and

711
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,799
approximate solution is good enough and

712
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,559
that is something you know Nature has

713
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,279
already figured out even before Bas came

714
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,440
out with the base theorem uh so we kind

715
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:27,200
of mimic those principles in these kind

716
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,080
of devices um uh but in the for the last

717
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,320
part of my talk and I'm going to focus

718
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,159
more about the the future of computing

719
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,600
you and why 2D material is something

720
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,760
that we are using for the future of

721
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,399
computing and trying to do all the

722
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,480
neuromorphic with 2D material I mean

723
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,360
which we all know that we are

724
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,919
transitioning from finfit technology

725
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,720
very soon into gate rollar around and

726
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:46,799
eventually to C fet or you know Nano

727
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,679
sheet technology and the main idea

728
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,000
behind that is that you need to have

729
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,200
better gate electrostatics more gate you

730
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,360
put around your transistor the better

731
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,279
your transistor performance will become

732
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,279
so you not only make the transistor uh

733
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:02,440
you know oxide very thin but you also

734
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:04,120
try to put it you know gate all around

735
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,320
but in order to do that you also need to

736
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,080
have the channel being very thin right

737
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,480
and you cannot really make silicon too

738
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,480
thin because of the fact that the

739
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,559
mobility of silicon kind of goes down

740
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,200
the drain when you make it you know a

741
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,520
monol layer or 1 nanometer thick you

742
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,679
can't even have a manufacturable

743
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,399
technique to make 1 nanometer silicon

744
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,840
although very recently in iedm uh I

745
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:25,000
think they were demonstration showing

746
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,000
that 1.5 nanometer of silicon films can

747
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,440
be made so so our competition gets

748
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,480
tougher but we are not going to use the

749
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,320
hope with the 2D material but the idea

750
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,240
is that the 2D material can offer you

751
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,279
much higher Mobility numbers so the

752
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,399
trans or better transport in the channel

753
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,440
at the similar thickness you know which

754
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,840
your silicon or any bulk material cannot

755
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,600
provide So eventually if you think about

756
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,799
2D material that the ultimate choice for

757
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,159
any

758
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,960
transistor now uh even if you kind of

759
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,480
make the transistor very very small

760
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,440
ultimately you're going to be limited by

761
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,799
the lithography tools right I mean you

762
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,880
cannot make a transistor which is you

763
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,360
know two or 3 nanometer in length that's

764
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,960
not going to be possible with the to

765
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,200
graphy Tool so so ultimately at the end

766
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,679
of the day you have to start doing you

767
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,600
know 3D integration uh because you have

768
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,039
to start stacking devices on top of each

769
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,519
other if you really need to get more

770
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:12,480
transistor in the same footprint so 3D

771
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,320
integration is probably the ultimate way

772
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,000
to reinstate M law and I think in might

773
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,279
Professor Kims group is working a lot on

774
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,960
this 3D integration uh now this is very

775
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,000
difficult to do with silicon logic

776
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,799
because of the fact that at the back end

777
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,159
I cannot really get high performance

778
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,200
silicon uh and therefore I lose you know

779
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,240
know all the wonderful quality that the

780
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,559
Silicon provides uh U although this is

781
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,120
something that has already happened for

782
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,039
the memory industry because for the

783
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,880
memory silicon is just a readout Channel

784
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,720
I don't really care about the high

785
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,159
performance from those memory devices so

786
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,640
you can really stack these uh and this

787
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,039
is something that is not possible

788
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,720
currently with you know silicon

789
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,919
technology or it's going to be extremely

790
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,799
expensive but the 2D material gives you

791
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,120
an opportunity to do the 3D integration

792
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,679
because you can really you know either

793
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,360
you know grow these 2D materials on a

794
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,159
different wafer and keep transfer ing

795
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,679
them and making transistors so we really

796
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,960
not bound to the substrate uh and that

797
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,080
is literally what we are kind of

798
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,880
exploiting uh and then I think 3D

799
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,799
integration as I told you is just not to

800
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,799
make more transistor you can also start

801
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:13,840
putting different functionalities in

802
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,000
every layer right from sensing storage

803
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,039
logic and that way you can mitigate this

804
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,360
Von bottleneck or you know this memory

805
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:22,159
wall problem of shuttling data between

806
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,120
you know different sensors and uh

807
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,240
compute units which kind of cost a lot

808
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,559
of energy so 3D integration is good for

809
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,080
both more more as well as more than mod

810
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,919
application and U although you know

811
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,840
industry is looking into a different way

812
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:36,640
of doing this uh heterogeneous

813
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,000
integration using packaging technology

814
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
they're putting different chiplets

815
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,640
together using interposer uh but

816
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,279
eventually to have the highest density

817
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,440
of interconnection you have to go

818
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,159
monolithic 3D integration because of the

819
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,080
fact that when you do through silicon VR

820
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,399
the VR Dimension can only be you know T

821
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,799
of micrometer maybe down to a micrometer

822
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,760
but when you do it in a monolithic

823
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,080
manner you can really have uh the VR as

824
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,720
small small as your transistor

825
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,399
interconnects and that's why you know

826
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,000
monolithic integration is the best way

827
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:07,080
of getting highest transistor

828
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,600
interconnectivity which is the key for

829
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,480
3D integration so this is something that

830
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,360
we are doing at pen State we are working

831
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,440
with two types of 2D material our focus

832
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,080
is currently on for the channel we are

833
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,159
working on N type mos2 and ptype tungen

834
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,720
selenide these are right now grown on

835
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,960
sap substrate at 800 to 1,000°

836
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,600
Centigrade epit uh we get very good

837
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,080
quality 2D material over 2in w

838
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,799
very soon we're going to have capability

839
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,440
of doing it on the 4in Wafers and then

840
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,120
we go ahead and transfer this material

841
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,519
using this pmma assisted uh uh transfer

842
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,640
process which still requires more

843
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,159
optimization but the the end story is

844
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,039
that we can actually start making you

845
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,799
know thousands and thousands of devices

846
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,720
to start looking into their uniformity

847
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:50,360
yield you know and variation from

848
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,080
devices to devices so so this is our

849
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,159
first you know we kind of published this

850
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,639
paper last year where we were able to

851
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,519
for the first time demonstrate you know

852
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:00,120
monolithic integration of you know 2D

853
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,960
transition s here you are seeing a chip

854
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,840
which has 30,000 transistors in two

855
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,039
tiers each in each tier has got 30,000

856
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,760
transistors the total number is 60,000

857
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,760
we were able to also scale these devices

858
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,840
down to channel length of 45 nanometer

859
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,799
we can go down to 20 nanometer it's just

860
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,679
the eeld kind of goes down with the

861
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,360
shorter Channel than devices and we

862
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,080
don't even stop at only stacking two

863
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,639
tiers of devices we can stack three

864
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,440
tiers of transistors on top of each

865
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,360
other and and you can see the clear

866
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,279
Advantage the transistor footprint

867
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,519
Remains the Same while I'm you know

868
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,279
simply increasing the number of

869
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,519
transistors I kind of stack them on top

870
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,399
of each other and as I told you now you

871
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,480
can connect your transistors in the

872
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,639
bottom and the top tier by the VR which

873
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,639
is sitting right next to the transistor

874
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:44,720
right that's the key advantage of doing

875
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:46,000
uh 3D integration in a monolithic manner

876
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,919
uh we actually measured a lot of

877
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,279
transistors these are 10,000 transistors

878
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,080
in tier one uh and you can see the

879
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,399
distribution of these devices across the

880
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,720
wafer performances in this type of

881
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,279
devices were not as high uh towards the

882
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,840
end of the stock I will talk about some

883
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:01,760
of the high performance transistors that

884
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,080
we have made uh these are tier one

885
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,519
transistors this is tier 2 transistors

886
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,760
what I'm saying is that the 2D material

887
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,600
is maturing to scale right we can

888
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,000
actually now demonstrate large area

889
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,279
large number of

890
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,399
transistors uh these are scale devices

891
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,840
scale devices show more variation so we

892
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:18,200
need to have a lot of improvement in our

893
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,200
lithography in order to get to you know

894
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,120
scaled devices with more

895
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,760
uniformity um and these are some

896
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,360
cross-sectional TM images showing you

897
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,360
know MOS all the three tiers these are

898
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,000
the tier one tier 2 tier three devices

899
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,399
for the nmos but we can also do it with

900
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,120
tungsten selenide and then it is a pmos

901
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:38,360
device right so we have both nmos and

902
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,559
pmos stacked in three tiers so that's

903
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,440
the first uh round of our demonstration

904
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,559
and remember each of these device also

905
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,399
has a memory integrated with them

906
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,480
because we are having this flash kind of

907
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,000
you know memory architecture where we

908
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,799
have alumina halfa alumina where the

909
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,399
small band Gap material can charge

910
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,679
straps uh uh sandwich between two large

911
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:58,559
band Gap material when you apply

912
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,799
voltages so these are all in memory

913
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,480
Computing uh capable you know devices so

914
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,600
uh you can see the memory ratio memory

915
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,720
retention and to some extent also the

916
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,760
memory endurance in these devices right

917
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,960
and these devices I told you earlier are

918
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,039
also you know sensitive to light so you

919
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,880
can also use them as photo sensor so now

920
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,919
you have integrated logic sensing and

921
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,639
Computing in all these 30,000

922
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:22,799
transistors which are there you know

923
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:24,799
across you know these different years so

924
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,799
that is really you know both transistor

925
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,639
scaling as well as functionality scaling

926
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,519
now moving forward I mean I also like to

927
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,039
thank for of my students because this

928
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,559
was not trivial at all because the total

929
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,639
number of lithography step that it

930
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:39,399
required was actually 38 you know and

931
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:41,720
doing this number of lithography St in

932
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,760
an academic environment and making sure

933
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,519
everything works is uh really

934
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,120
non-trivial you know we can I can simply

935
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,399
say we putting transistors on top of

936
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,080
each other but it is not trivial and a

937
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:52,880
lot of you actually do this every day so

938
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,960
you will be able to appreciate it

939
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,559
more uh so now next step is that okay so

940
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,519
now we have got uh uh uh unipolar

941
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,559
transistors stacked on top of together

942
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,320
can we do seos capability so we found

943
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,799
that tungsten C is a very interesting

944
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,000
material because if you put nickel

945
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:09,879
contact and if you do alumina capping

946
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,919
you get a very nice n type

947
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:14,720
characteristics from tonson selenite but

948
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,240
if you change it to padium as the

949
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,639
contact and haia as a capping layer then

950
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,440
you get a very nice P type

951
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,760
characteristic so now I have both n and

952
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,879
p characteristics from the same material

953
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,960
so can't we start building you know 3D

954
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,520
seos capabilities so here is our first

955
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,280
demonstration of of a 3D CS now we are

956
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,079
going Beyond inverter we are trying to

957
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
make more complex circuits in this case

958
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,159
an nand gate which has two nmos

959
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,000
transistors in the tier one and then

960
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,240
they're connected through this VR to the

961
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,440
two top transistors which are P type in

962
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,919
tier 2 so now we can start looking into

963
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,480
really the advantage of 3D integration

964
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,399
and you can see over here that the VR is

965
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,760
connecting transistor to transistor this

966
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:54,639
is something you cannot do with through

967
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,520
silicon via technology or heterogeneous

968
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,359
integration right so the main advantage

969
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,800
of 3D kind of shows up over here so and

970
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,480
you can see each transistor also has

971
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,000
this memory so it's like inmemory

972
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,000
compute capability with you know 3D

973
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,880
SOS uh and then you know we also

974
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,599
demonstrated other kinds of logic gates

975
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,720
one thing I would mention the yield of

976
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:15,720
this uh logic gates were pretty poor

977
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,359
okay only 10% to 20% of this logic gets

978
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,040
actually worked but they worked uh so

979
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,440
this was the first demonstration of a

980
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,359
you know 3D seos capability uh and as I

981
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,240
told you that you know I mean industry

982
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,160
is taking this heterogeneous integration

983
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,000
aspect and today they have been able to

984
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,280
achieve you know the VR pitch of 1

985
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,680
micrometer uh after so many years of

986
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,960
investment uh uh and the in this IO

987
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,880
density is a key parameter that's going

988
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,800
to be benchmarking you know going

989
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,520
forward for the 3D and you can see even

990
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,560
in an academic environment or first

991
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,400
generation or these are not even gen

992
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,880
zero devices maybe gen minus one devices

993
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,760
can achieve you know integration density

994
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,200
which can compete with you know the the

995
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,640
uh 3D packaging technology so that's the

996
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,680
advantage of Monolithic 3D inte

997
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,079
integration and then as I told you right

998
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,079
this doesn't have to stop in only you

999
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,040
know seos transistors we can actually

1000
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,800
now Place graphine devices on the top

1001
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,079
tier which could be good for chem

1002
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,079
sensing application and mos2 devices in

1003
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,119
the bottom tier for logic so you can now

1004
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,599
do near sensor Computing so here is a

1005
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,880
chip which has you know graphine

1006
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,680
transistors on top and mos2 transistors

1007
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,240
in the bottom you can see look at the

1008
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,800
cross-sectional TM uh and you can see

1009
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,359
that the graphine devices are sitting

1010
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,440
right on top of your mos2 transistor so

1011
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:31,280
you can really do now you know in sensor

1012
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,079
on near sensor compute uh with this chip

1013
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,800
we did a very quick demonstration we put

1014
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,440
a liquid droplet and as a droplet

1015
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,839
evaporates you know the concentration of

1016
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,359
salt in the droplet changes that changes

1017
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,440
the response of the graphine device in

1018
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:44,599
an analog Manner and then we took that

1019
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,760
analog information and digitized this

1020
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,920
using some mos2 based comparator circuit

1021
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,599
so very simple application but you can

1022
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,319
see the potential of you know

1023
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,440
integrating heterogenous material now in

1024
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:56,720
this 3D

1025
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,359
stack um so that was you know another

1026
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,160
example this also so we I think we just

1027
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:03,520
published uh two months back and then

1028
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,359
again it doesn't have to only restrict

1029
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,800
to just 2D material as I was telling at

1030
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,160
the very beginning of my talk you can

1031
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,160
also start stacking you know 2D and 3D

1032
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,319
materials you know like for example a

1033
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,160
lot of work that you know my

1034
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:15,960
collaborator Professor Jalan is doing at

1035
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,040
University of Minnesota has to do with

1036
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,599
Paro Sky's material and he is able to

1037
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,920
grow this using this hybrid MB technique

1038
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,000
on a sacrificial layer which is latis

1039
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,200
matched so therefore you get a very good

1040
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,079
quality of sto film but now you can

1041
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,079
dissolve olve that stonum oxide in water

1042
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,079
and you can create a nanomembrane of

1043
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,040
this peroxides so now you can start

1044
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,240
taking this peroxide material and start

1045
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,640
stacking them with the 2D material and

1046
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,319
in that way enable newer functionality

1047
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,040
so in this kind of a device we found

1048
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:46,880
that we have something called incipient

1049
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,920
fero electricity U where you get this

1050
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,480
counterclockwise estasis in the uh mos2

1051
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,720
gated by stto we got some you know polar

1052
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,240
order from the second harmonic

1053
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,560
generation measurement but one thing

1054
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,200
which was not very good was you know the

1055
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,599
tension was very poor because an f f you

1056
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,440
should have two polarization state that

1057
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,000
are stable but because it's an incipient

1058
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,319
ferroelectric material you know it kind

1059
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,960
of depolarizes very quickly but what we

1060
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:11,240
found is that you know this material

1061
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,640
when you cool it down to low temperature

1062
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,520
you know the memory state becomes

1063
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,240
extremely stable so we went out to 100

1064
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,760
Kelvin and even 15 Kelvin and we found

1065
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,760
that it could be a very good alternative

1066
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,319
for cryogenic memory because in you

1067
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,079
cryogenic condition you know charge St

1068
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:26,560
memories may not work as well and for a

1069
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,760
lot of quantum applications you will

1070
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,880
need you know cryogenic memory devices

1071
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,560
so we went down to 15 Kelvin and we

1072
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,079
found that this device is actually an

1073
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,280
excellent memory device at low

1074
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,040
temperature with you know good long-term

1075
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,200
retention uh uh switching speed is less

1076
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,640
than 20 nond reasonably fast uh and you

1077
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,720
can also store you know almost 64

1078
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,520
discrete States in a single device it's

1079
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,760
almost like you know five bit to six bit

1080
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,720
of memory stored in a single device so

1081
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,839
so that's also another interesting area

1082
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,000
that I think is going to be absolutely

1083
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,280
you know interesting going forward so

1084
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,960
you can climb kind of see you know the

1085
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,480
importance of 3D integration you know

1086
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,520
and what we have been able to accomplish

1087
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,440
so far now I will you know for the last

1088
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,560
uh 10 minutes I'm going to talk a little

1089
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,640
bit about high performance devices

1090
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,119
because all the devices I showed you so

1091
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,680
far are pretty you know low in

1092
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,200
performance right I mean tens of

1093
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,960
micrograms of current to hundreds of

1094
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,520
micrograms of current so and I'm talking

1095
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,640
about know replacing silicon with this

1096
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,319
2D material so you can see that the

1097
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,000
requirement for the high performance

1098
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,920
devic is that you need to need to have a

1099
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,880
more than a milliamp micrometer on State

1100
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,440
current for both n and p and your

1101
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,640
parasitic capacitance has to be low

1102
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,040
because parastic capacitance has been a

1103
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,240
under uh you know studied Topic in the

1104
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,760
2D community and then one more important

1105
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,640
thing is that the low power application

1106
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,599
requires your supply voltage to be less

1107
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,000
than 1 volt your off current has to be

1108
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,560
zero or low at VG equal to zero and that

1109
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,079
is something you know not really

1110
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,319
addressed in the 2D Community we will

1111
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,079
see a l large onoff ratio but the

1112
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,760
devices gets turned off for a very you

1113
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:02,359
know negative VG for the nfed and very

1114
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,640
positive voltage for the pfed okay so

1115
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,200
and if you have that you can never

1116
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,240
design circuit okay so circuit designer

1117
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,880
will never be interested in 2D material

1118
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,240
so that's going to be very important of

1119
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,520
course you need to reduce device to

1120
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,079
device variation otherwise you cannot

1121
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,359
make circuits either so we have started

1122
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:21,920
looking into this so This are our most

1123
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,480
recent results on mos2 uh I think right

1124
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,200
now there's a consensus that antimon is

1125
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,160
the best contact material for uh 2D

1126
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,200
materials I mean b month is also very

1127
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,760
good here we using gold and that's why

1128
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,720
we don't reach as high performance as

1129
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,119
like milliamps per micrometer but we get

1130
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,680
to consistently 300 micr per micrometer

1131
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,800
on 1,000 devices right so large number

1132
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,240
of devices now we have been able to get

1133
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,920
to very high on State current and we

1134
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,480
have been able to reduce the off current

1135
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,720
at VG equal to zero the onoff ratio

1136
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,800
always existed with the 2D material but

1137
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,160
what we could not do is to bring down

1138
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,400
the off current to low values at VG

1139
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,599
equal to zero so we were able to do that

1140
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,040
with doing some growth optimization and

1141
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,280
you can kind of see that the device to

1142
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,319
device variation has also gone down

1143
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,960
quite a

1144
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:12,359
bit and then you know you can do all

1145
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,160
this uh uh statistical plot and you can

1146
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,599
see that you know the threshold voltage

1147
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,119
variation is actually quite quite low

1148
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,079
and if you compare it with the existing

1149
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,440
silicon technology it is getting there

1150
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,079
it's still not there I will show you

1151
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,880
some more slides on that and then when

1152
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,280
you compare it you know this is a plot I

1153
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,319
wanted to draw your attention two that

1154
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,520
you see I mean many devices show very

1155
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,440
high on State current but they cannot

1156
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,800
turn off their device at VG equal to

1157
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,880
zero because the right corner for you to

1158
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,920
be in this extreme right hand plot is

1159
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,480
the you know upper uh left hand corner

1160
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:50,119
right because you need to have both high

1161
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,720
on current and large onoff Ratio or low

1162
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:54,440
off current at VG equal to zero and that

1163
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,560
is something that has not been really

1164
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,800
achieved okay you can get high on

1165
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,480
current but you cannot turn off this

1166
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,200
device so threshold engineering becomes

1167
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,560
extremely important but you can see that

1168
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,839
you know we have been able to get to the

1169
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,680
corner where tsmc and Intel are I mean

1170
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:09,520
tsmc in is still a little bit better

1171
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,319
than us okay and our champion device get

1172
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,760
up to almost like 300 microns for

1173
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:15,119
micrometer current so that is nfet now

1174
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,640
what has been struggling in the

1175
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,319
community for quite a bit is a p fet

1176
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,760
right P fet performances have been even

1177
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:25,040
poorer but we have now been able to

1178
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,960
achieve similar performing P fet so our

1179
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,520
pfet currents are also now of the order

1180
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,200
of 250 to 300 micr per micrometer and we

1181
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,119
have been able to do that with you know

1182
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,280
something we are using called the anod

1183
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,119
doing so we have defect passivation

1184
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,760
because defect was actually really

1185
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,960
creating a lot of problem with stun and

1186
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,720
selenite with anod doping we able to

1187
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,680
passivate the selenium vacancies and we

1188
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,480
able to get to very high performance

1189
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,359
device to device variation is also quite

1190
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,240
low um and you can see that even for the

1191
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:55,280
pfed the pets are off at VG equal to

1192
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,440
zero because that's what I need to make

1193
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,680
circuits and again when you compare comp

1194
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,480
it with all the other literature now you

1195
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,440
can see that you know I mean uh this is

1196
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,960
probably the best result in literature

1197
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,720
for the p fet uh because we get both

1198
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,720
very high on current as well as large

1199
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,480
onoff ratio right so now we have both

1200
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,760
the high performance n MOS and pmos with

1201
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,079
the right threshold voltage so now we

1202
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,680
can start moving into making more

1203
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,720
reasonable circuits so we have started

1204
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,559
now building uh using pdks so now we are

1205
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,480
using the layout design that you will

1206
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,480
use for a particular technology node so

1207
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,079
we are using right now 200 nanometer 192

1208
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,200
nanom technology node and we are now

1209
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:38,640
designing all the circuits like nand n

1210
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,200
and you can see they work all with 3vt

1211
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,200
and here I'd also like to mention that

1212
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,920
because a lot of people are looking into

1213
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,280
oxides your gate voltage is generally 20

1214
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,440
volts 30 volts remember our vdd has to

1215
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,520
be low for both The Source drain voltage

1216
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,079
as well as the gate voltage unless you

1217
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,480
do that your circuits are not going to

1218
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,760
work right so you also need to scale the

1219
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,400
oxides so all the data that I showed you

1220
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,920
were with uot numbers of 2.3 nanometer

1221
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,079
so we have been using you know 10

1222
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,319
nanometer or 5 nanometer halfam oxide

1223
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,280
and we are able to get down to really

1224
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,880
you know low voltage operation of this

1225
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,160
transistor and that is why we can now

1226
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,640
make the circuits operate so these are

1227
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,000
nand and Norgate zor gate you know which

1228
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:21,960
requires more transistors uh

1229
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,319
multiplexers uh D flip flops because you

1230
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,920
do not only need you know combinatorial

1231
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,680
circuits you also need sequential

1232
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,119
circuits right for you know to design a

1233
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,240
computer so we can make D flip flog we

1234
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,760
can also make srams right these are the

1235
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,880
very basic component of a uh building a

1236
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,720
computer using 2D material so now we

1237
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,240
have all the basic component so what

1238
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,720
lefts to be done is to make the

1239
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,280
computer so here is the first

1240
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,800
demonstration of a 2d cosos computer

1241
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,599
which has all the sequential and

1242
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,040
combination real circuits you have D

1243
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,680
flip flog arithmetic logic unit and we

1244
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,559
are using a single instruction set

1245
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,760
computer

1246
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,640
this is the ultimate version of a risk

1247
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,319
processor risk processor is reduceed

1248
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,079
instruction set processor if you go down

1249
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:09,240
to one instruction right U uh you can do

1250
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,599
all operation it just takes longer time

1251
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,440
okay and we are also designing it for

1252
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:14,200
one bit this is not a 32-bit computer

1253
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,640
right I mean that will be too much so we

1254
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,880
design this entire computer so here is

1255
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,119
this entire computer over here which has

1256
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,599
72 nmos and 72 pses you can see the pmos

1257
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,520
and nmos sitting right next to each

1258
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,200
other right now uh because we can you

1259
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,559
know transfer them and make all these

1260
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,000
devices on ultra thin

1261
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,520
oxides and this actually works okay so

1262
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,800
we can actually make a single

1263
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,200
instruction set computer work and here

1264
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,359
are the you know the uh timing diagrams

1265
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,559
of this 2dcos computer this is the first

1266
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,480
demonstration of a 2dcos computer uh but

1267
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,839
then we fail in something and this is

1268
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,079
what I wanted to you know highlight this

1269
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:56,240
uh look at the speed of these devices

1270
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,920
they're working at hundreds of microc I

1271
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,599
don't think Intel anybody will be

1272
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,280
interested if the speed is so poor right

1273
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,119
but then you know why are we limited on

1274
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,359
speed we are not limited on the speed

1275
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,119
from a fundamental device point of view

1276
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:10,040
we are restricted by the parasitic

1277
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,280
capacitances which our community has not

1278
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,680
really paid a lot of attention to okay

1279
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,720
we have a lot of you know measurement

1280
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,400
capacit big pads you know that we are

1281
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,920
using for measuring these devices so we

1282
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,079
thought about okay uh that we figured

1283
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,640
out so what about you know we do some

1284
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,480
you know modeling of the devices so uh

1285
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,599
this is the industry standard you know

1286
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,680
BC bulk model which was developed by

1287
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,079
Chang mingu right from UC Berkeley and

1288
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,240
the industry uses this model so any new

1289
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,359
transistor technology you should be able

1290
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,920
to match it to this Bim bulk model and

1291
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,079
you can see that our experimental

1292
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,559
characteristics matches very well with

1293
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,800
the Bim bul once we have it we can start

1294
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,839
doing spice simulation right because

1295
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,680
then that will tell me you know if I

1296
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,040
were to reduce all my parasitic

1297
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,480
capacitances what will be my projected

1298
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,000
performance and we found that if you can

1299
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,440
get down to a F2 farad of capacitance

1300
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,680
your speed actually becomes T of PC

1301
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,480
right so today we are not limited

1302
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:08,280
anymore by the transistor performance

1303
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,440
but by the parasitics so 2D is catching

1304
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,200
up with the Silicon even in terms of the

1305
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,440
circuit it's just that we have to now

1306
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,440
take care of this aspect and we did it

1307
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,040
for all the different logic gates uh and

1308
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,359
then eventually we thought about okay

1309
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,200
why don't we compare this uh 2D single

1310
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:27,040
instruction computer made out of 2D

1311
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,839
material with silicon finfet right so

1312
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,119
kind of used the most advanced silicon 7

1313
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:34,760
nanometer you know pdk and you know all

1314
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,720
the BCM bulk model for that and you can

1315
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,760
kind of see this these SS TT and FF are

1316
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,480
just simply we take the slowest nmos and

1317
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,000
slowest pmos from our 2D and FF means

1318
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,839
you know fastest C and fastest nmos from

1319
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,559
our 2D and the TT is the typical one

1320
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:51,480
which is the median value and you can

1321
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:55,079
see that the 2D instruction computer is

1322
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,440
only 10x worse than the most advanced

1323
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,960
silicon finfet devices and remember our

1324
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,920
devices are still 200 nanom to 100

1325
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,440
nanometer Channel length our eots are

1326
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:08,000
still not 1 nanometer so we really have

1327
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,160
a lot of room to improve our 2D

1328
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,599
performance and really get to the

1329
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,440
performance of silicon devices so we are

1330
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:18,000
not too far and we are only 10 years

1331
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,839
into real exploration of 2D materials

1332
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,280
especially the actual exploration has

1333
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,920
probably started in last three four

1334
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,440
years right so there's a lot of Promise

1335
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,640
in 2D material and that's why we are

1336
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,040
using 2D for doing all these St with

1337
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,760
that I would probably end you know these

1338
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,839
are all our Publications so uh the the

1339
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,720
2D computer paper just got accepted

1340
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,440
earlier this week in nature as well so

1341
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,400
I'm very happy that that is going to

1342
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,160
come out uh uh but if you're interested

1343
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,920
uh uh you can look into these papers but

1344
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,319
I think you can see our main philosophy

1345
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,280
is to go towards 3D integration with

1346
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,280
high performance and low power 2D

1347
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,040
devices and maybe also bring into the

1348
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,119
mix you know some of these 3D nanom

1349
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,799
membranes to develop you know new

1350
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,920
paradigm of sensing Computing and

1351
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:00,960
storage which is inspired by you know

1352
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,680
biological brains animal brains uh to

1353
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,760
really satisfy the need for both more

1354
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,000
more and more than more with that I

1355
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,720
would like to thank you and I will be

1356
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,720
happy to take any

1357
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,200
questions thanks for a great

1358
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:17,079
talk thanks a lot so we have time maybe

1359
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,400
10 minutes for questions so any

1360
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,200
questions from the audience while I'll

1361
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,760
look

1362
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,359
online hello uh absolutely inspiring

1363
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,319
talk I want to change my research field

1364
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,200
um I guess so uh when you present it it

1365
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,680
looks so simple but I guess how how

1366
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,599
robust and how much knowledge do you

1367
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:38,079
need from a theory and from the AI side

1368
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,319
like were you able to train up a

1369
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,240
graduate student or did they have to

1370
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:43,599
almost have a completely separate skill

1371
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:46,760
set to be able to integrate within your

1372
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,480
group and do these calculations uh I I

1373
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,680
think one thing which is important is to

1374
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,400
have you know diverse range of graduate

1375
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,839
students so I think some of my graduate

1376
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,160
students do have a little bit of

1377
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,000
background in machine learning uh and

1378
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,559
then you know are also students who have

1379
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,040
more you know more senior students who

1380
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:03,400
have background in mostly the device

1381
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,520
aspect but I think this kind of a

1382
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,640
marriage is very important uh for them

1383
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,799
to do the projects like this so so I

1384
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,400
mean is that your question I mean what

1385
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:16,920
kind of expertise you need in order to

1386
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,440
do this thing I mean uh would you would

1387
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,680
you need um a more expert group to be

1388
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,520
able to like let's say I collected that

1389
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,359
data would I need an expert group to be

1390
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,160
able to apply that uh ma learning model

1391
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:31,440
or do you think it's got to a point

1392
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,760
where an amateur could I think machine

1393
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,160
learning models are probably the easiest

1394
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,240
part in this uh entire thing I would say

1395
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,839
because you know I mean they're all

1396
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,920
available you know you know you can

1397
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,520
really I mean today any undergraduate

1398
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,720
that comes out can write all this python

1399
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,520
code they probably know this thing

1400
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,280
better than even me you know I mean but

1401
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,559
I'm saying the developing expertise in

1402
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,119
this kind of machine learning that we

1403
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,720
are doing probably doesn't uh require a

1404
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,400
lot of background in machine what you

1405
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,559
need is a lot of vision for what you

1406
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,680
want to do with this data

1407
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,000
you know for example when we thought

1408
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,119
about I mean there's a lot of followup

1409
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,200
work we are doing in this graphine

1410
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,960
sensor work right where we're trying to

1411
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:10,440
identify uh can you you know train a

1412
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:14,200
machine with the existing data on some

1413
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,720
contaminant with some known solution and

1414
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,200
get the graphine device of the machine

1415
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,119
learning model to learn the signature of

1416
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,839
the contaminant and then test it in a

1417
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:24,319
completely unknown solution right so

1418
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:25,559
these kind of problems I think which

1419
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,960
were almost

1420
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,319
unimaginable you know 5 years back are

1421
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,040
now possible with the advancement in the

1422
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:35,240
AI part because all these models were

1423
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,079
not as much available back then so

1424
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,040
there's a power of this machine learning

1425
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,760
tools or all this chat GPD and whatever

1426
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,599
Evolution has happened is can now drive

1427
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,520
or mitigate a lot of challenge that we

1428
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:48,799
Face generally with this 2D material or

1429
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,240
in general nanomaterial Community is

1430
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:52,559
what my feeling is so we want to bring

1431
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,559
that expertise in this field which

1432
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,000
already exist and pretty welld

1433
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,799
developed awesome thank you

1434
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,839
so one question from our online audience

1435
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:05,079
considering the potential for large area

1436
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,040
synthesis which 2D materials do you

1437
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:09,640
believe offer the greatest potential for

1438
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,440
immediate or near-term impact in

1439
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,520
electronics and sensors and on that

1440
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,240
topic can you maybe also comment a

1441
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,640
little bit more on the processing you

1442
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,359
did to the 2D material to get to your

1443
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,880
computer again no excellent question I

1444
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:25,720
think U uh well there are so many 2D

1445
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,839
material so at pen State we have uh made

1446
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,920
sure we focus on couple because if you

1447
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,680
start focusing on 10 different 20

1448
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,520
different 2D materials become then you

1449
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,960
are completely defocused so we have

1450
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,799
identified mos2 because it's probably

1451
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,720
one of the most it's probably the

1452
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:44,359
easiest one to grow uh it has a lot of

1453
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,240
you know air stability uh it's very easy

1454
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:48,520
to work with so there therefore there's

1455
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,720
a lot of optimization that has gone into

1456
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,400
you know developing mos2 as the end type

1457
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,200
2D material it's also much easier to

1458
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,480
make end type contact to mos2 so mos2

1459
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,760
becomes a Natural Choice P fet still is

1460
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,920
a long-standing uh challenge in the

1461
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,520
field so very recently we have got some

1462
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,079
exciting results with tungsten selenide

1463
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,200
there are other candidates like moly

1464
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:12,520
selenide mide tellides are more

1465
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,799
difficult to grow and also not very

1466
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:17,480
stable because they tend to oxidize so

1467
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:20,040
selenide strikes a balance between the

1468
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,760
stability how easily it can be grown and

1469
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,920
then you can do some doping technique to

1470
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,280
get to highp Fed performance so that's

1471
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,040
why we have focused on these two

1472
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,000
material but you know I mean tomorrow

1473
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,440
somebody may come up with a very new

1474
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,760
material so recently there's a paper I

1475
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,920
think in nature materials about bisat

1476
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,760
oxyselenide that material also seems

1477
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,880
like promising because that has a native

1478
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,720
oxide which is very high quality these

1479
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,520
2D materials don't have a native oxide

1480
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,079
like this silicon right So eventually we

1481
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,799
have to also think about integrating

1482
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,040
gate dialectric so that remains a

1483
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:50,680
challenge all the data that I have

1484
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,839
showed you over here are back gated

1485
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,160
transistors eventually the computer has

1486
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:56,640
to be made using topg transistors top

1487
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,200
gate will require you to have a very

1488
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,000
good dialectric on the top and basil you

1489
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,240
know I mean the nucleation on this 2D

1490
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
material is going to be tough so you

1491
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,839
have to innovate over there how to get a

1492
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,160
very high quality dialectric as a top

1493
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:10,480
gate uh we want to minimize defect in

1494
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,760
this tuning material but if you

1495
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,480
eliminate all defects then you also

1496
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,160
cannot nucleate very well on the uh on

1497
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,680
the basil plane of this 2D material so

1498
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,559
there has to be a lot of work that has

1499
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,920
to go in in order to also optimize that

1500
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:26,440
we're also looking into a lot of uh 2D

1501
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,319
dialectric because then they can be put

1502
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,400
right on top of the the 2D materials

1503
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,160
with a good

1504
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,880
interface uh so there's a lot of

1505
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,480
optimization that has gone into to get

1506
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,319
to this stage but I think there's still

1507
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:41,280
lot more engineering challenges remains

1508
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,280
to be solved thank you any other

1509
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,480
questions um as graphine Purity

1510
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:52,160
increases do you foresee uh like n&p dop

1511
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,960
or dopes uh graphine as a option for p&n

1512
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,839
type oh I think graphine is definitely

1513
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,040
not a choice at all

1514
00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:01,040
uh because it doesn't have a band Gap so

1515
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,559
I cannot turn off my transistors right

1516
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,200
so even

1517
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,079
doped uh you can dope it doping will

1518
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,880
change the threshold the direct point

1519
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,280
right the doping is not going to open up

1520
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,880
a band Gap so unless I open up a band

1521
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,440
Gap in graphine I mean graphine is uh

1522
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,640
mostly not very useful for transistor

1523
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,799
application it's very good for sensing

1524
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,799
though thank

1525
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,200
you uh I was curious about the electron

1526
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,960
mobility of 2D materials as you stack up

1527
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,880
this uh structures to into 3D and you is

1528
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:38,039
it is it really the mos2 type of uh

1529
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,960
material that uh improves the electron

1530
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,760
mobility

1531
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,559
and would you need to I guess another

1532
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,960
way of asking how would you deal with

1533
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:50,799
the terminal profile of a 3D mos2 and

1534
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:52,960
how you would cool it down you know yeah

1535
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,680
I think excellent question so Mobility

1536
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,280
numbers right now what we get is of the

1537
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:00,839
order of 10 to 20 in mos2 and I think

1538
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,400
similar number for wsc2 theoretically

1539
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,839
projected numbers are higher so we

1540
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,920
should probably be able to get there as

1541
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,599
we reduce the number of sulfur vacancies

1542
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,839
in this films and have to reduce the

1543
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,920
grain boundaries and things like that so

1544
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,119
Mobility is probably as long as I get to

1545
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,720
100 I'm happy because you know once you

1546
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,280
make the devices too small Mobility

1547
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,160
doesn't matter that much anyways what

1548
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,200
matters is the contact resistance and

1549
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,119
the on current so as long as I have a

1550
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,400
low contact resistance in a scale device

1551
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,400
I should be able to get to high

1552
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,960
performance and then when it comes to

1553
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,599
the thermal management that's an

1554
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,599
excellent question I mean we are

1555
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,480
struggling to manage the heat in a 2d

1556
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,359
chip so in a 3D chip the thermal

1557
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,880
management is going to be even worse so

1558
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,000
there's a lot of interest in looking

1559
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,720
into you know heat spreaders right so

1560
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,079
innovation in materials which can at

1561
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,960
least spread the heat if you cannot

1562
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,599
completely eliminate it uh or you know

1563
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,400
you do some kind of a design where you

1564
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:50,079
do not really have a lot of hot spots so

1565
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,520
your transistor or the architecture

1566
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:55,480
design can be some uh Innovation can

1567
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:57,520
come over there um so but that managing

1568
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,000
the heat in a 3 tdic is going to be an

1569
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,280
emerging

1570
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,720
topic thank you for your talk and my

1571
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,599
question is during the talk you

1572
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,839
mentioned that the yield of the devic is

1573
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,559
10 to 20% do you have any idea how to

1574
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:13,200
improve no I think the yield of the

1575
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,079
devices is high so I think mos2 devices

1576
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,520
we can get to very high yield you know

1577
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:19,559
sometimes even 100% yield when we are

1578
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,319
trying to do this more complex circuits

1579
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,039
in a 3D architecture then the yield goes

1580
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,920
down and I think this is something you

1581
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:27,880
know I mean we are in Academia so as you

1582
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,240
know I mean we Face a lot of challenges

1583
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,720
you know because we transfer the

1584
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,680
material sometimes the transfer doesn't

1585
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,799
go very well is the fact that you know

1586
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,559
these 3D Fabrications are uh not only

1587
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:39,400
easy but also very expensive so you

1588
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:42,160
cannot just go and simply repeat it just

1589
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,680
to get a 100% yield right so I think the

1590
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,319
proof of concept we demonstrate that it

1591
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,160
can be done and then I think once it

1592
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,480
goes to the industry level I think the

1593
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,680
yield problem should be able to be

1594
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,760
manage thank

1595
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:59,480
you let's thank our speaker again for a

1596
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,480
wonderful full talk
