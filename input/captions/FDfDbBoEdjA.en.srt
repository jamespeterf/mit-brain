1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,400
hello my name is Josh Santos and I'm the

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,920
co-founder and CEO of noya I'm an MIT

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,879
chemical engineer and I have the

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,720
pleasure of working with this incredible

5
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:19,880
team of people here that you see behind

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,199
me we're based in Oakland California and

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,840
we're working on what I believe to be

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,080
the world's biggest problem which is

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,920
climate change I think it's the biggest

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,039
problem because uh I uh because it puts

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,920
places like this at risk I took this

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,800
picture in a mile five of a 13m hike at

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,120
a place called Glacier National Park in

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,039
the United States and this place and

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,039
many others like it are places that are

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,480
at risk due to our changing climate my

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,640
vision for the future and our vision at

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
Noya is that we can provide the same

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,760
exact planet that we experienced during

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,800
our lifetimes to all future humans and

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,920
generations and the reason that this is

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,879
hard is because we are not decarbonizing

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,640
our planet fast enough to actually allow

24
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,519
for us to meet that shared Vision that

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,760
we have Noya the gray bit that you see

26
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,920
at the top here represents Humanity's

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,799
carbon emissions over the past 50

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,159
years I don't know what that looks like

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,000
to you but that looks like it's getting

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,360
bigger over time to me and that is in

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,080
fact the case we have been growing our

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,400
emissions dramatically over the past 50

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,000
years the United Nations in 2018 stated

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,320
for the first time that for us to

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,560
maintain a chance of giving a happy and

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
healthy planet to Future Generations we

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,119
need to do something called carbon

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,640
removal which is a sweet of Technologies

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,720
to actively pull historic CO2 emissions

40
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,479
out of the

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,119
atmosphere we need to scale this

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
industry fast if we want to maintain

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,240
that Vision to the tune of 50% year

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,960
on-year for the next 25 plus years to

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,280
say that differently that's the same

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,560
thing as growing in new industry from

47
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,960
nothing to the size of the oil and gas

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,399
industry and less than half the time it

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,759
took the oil and gas industry to get

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
there that's a massive Challenge and one

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,399
that is made even harder by the fact

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
that there are new industri

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
that are coming up specifically

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,479
artificial intelligence that's driving

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,880
up emissions of companies and Nations

56
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,479
worldwide it's driving up demand for

57
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,480
clean electricity that the rest of us

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,879
need in order to decarbonize the economy

59
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,599
and it's continuing to drive up the

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,160
demand for what we're building at Noya a

61
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,200
carbon removal approach so we have a

62
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,160
need to decarbonize we have challenges

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,200
that are very real and being made even

64
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,840
harder by all of what's happening in the

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,239
world around us and thankfully at Noya

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,239
we're bu we're building something that's

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,160
designed for this moment our technology

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,160
is built to permanently remove carbon

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,120
dioxide from the atmosphere while

70
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,080
producing lots of clean water and

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,959
operating in a very interruptible and

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
intermittent way we are flexible on how

73
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,920
we consume power and right now I'll tell

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,280
you how it

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,400
works in step one we move air through

76
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,519
what we call a module I like to describe

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
our technology as a solar panel for

78
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,800
carbon negativity because we can build

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,640
multiple of the same design to achieve

80
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,040
an increasingly large

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,840
scale as we move air through that

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,760
equipment that that contains a material

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,239
that we have engineered to capture both

84
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,920
CO2 and water from the atmosphere the

85
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,840
CO2 and water stay behind so that a

86
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,480
cleaner drier air move out of the back

87
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,280
of

88
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,040
it in step two we turn on electricity

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,280
every other approach to direct air

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,640
carbon capture which is what we're

91
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,239
developing at Noya requires a big

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,200
expensive piece of Capital Equipment

93
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,959
that makes something hot like an oven or

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,519
a kiln or steam generator that requires

95
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,680
base load electricity to run efficiently

96
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,040
Bas load meaning 24 7 electricity that's

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,200
really hard to get if your main way of

98
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,159
delivering and and creating Renewable

99
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,599
Power is uh is through solar and wind we

100
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,480
are different in that we can deliver

101
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,360
electricity directly to our material

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,760
that we've engineered and flow currents

103
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,799
through it to release the CO2 and water

104
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,920
that we've captured this allows us to be

105
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,120
flexible in how we consume power and

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,000
integrate with existing large loads and

107
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,439
we'll talk more about in a

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,680
second when we run power through our

109
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,000
through our material the CO2 and water

110
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,760
come out in a gaseous pure State and we

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,319
move them out of our equipment so that

112
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,200
we can use the equipment to capture more

113
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,120
CO2 we then separate the CO2 and water

114
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,560
from each other the water we have no

115
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,400
need for and so we sell it to folks that

116
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,239
have a big need for it like data center

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,680
companies Industrials and agriculture

118
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,799
some of our earliest clients and the CO2

119
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,400
we are currently planning to inject that

120
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,320
underground so it no longer warms the

121
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,040
planet in the atmosphere but we can also

122
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,759
put that CO2 to work in CCU applications

123
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,680
where you're taking CO2 and turning into

124
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,960
into new types of

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,800
products this unlocks two benefits that

126
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,160
are very unique in direct air capture

127
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,360
that we are the only company to be able

128
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,120
to actually harness due to the

129
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,960
technology that we're building the first

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
is that we can turn our equipment on and

131
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,440
off like a light switch the lights you

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,840
see above us here that makes us able to

133
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,759
Source really cheap really clean power

134
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,120
in a way that no other large industrial

135
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,800
climate Tech startup can and it also

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
allows us to integrate with large

137
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,000
existing loads like data centers and

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,400
other large loads to use the Excess

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,960
power that they are not consuming to

140
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,280
consume it ourselves to create CO2

141
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,759
removal the second benefit I mentioned

142
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,199
we produce lots of water from the

143
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,919
atmosphere we produce between 5 to seven

144
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,680
tons or 5 to seven cubic meters of water

145
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,039
per ton of CO2 that we capture we have

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,199
no need for that water and we believe

147
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,720
that at our full commercial capacity of

148
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,080
1 million tons per year with our

149
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,120
technology that water can change the

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,240
lives of many people around our projects

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,440
especially for building in water

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,479
stressed areas additionally we can sell

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,319
that water to generate additional remove

154
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,520
additional Revenue to subsidize the cost

155
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,400
of our carbon removal

156
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
technology we've got an incredible team

157
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,160
of folks my background as I mentioned is

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,440
in chemical engineering at MIT I also

159
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,360
worked at Tesla scaling up the model 3

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,960
Program I joined the week after the

161
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
model 3 launched and spent a lot of time

162
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
in manufacturing lines which is exactly

163
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,960
the expertise we're using at NOA in

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
addition to the expertise that our head

165
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,039
of equipment engineering JC has to help

166
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,479
us ensure that our module mod are being

167
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,680
designed for manufacturing from day

168
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,240
one John Greenfield is on our team he

169
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,919
scaled up Industrial Products he's right

170
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,520
here in Tokyo with us come say hi to us

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,160
later on today Sylvia actually worked at

172
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,479
a Japanese corporation kioser I'm sure

173
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,120
many of you know that company she

174
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,840
developed solar panel materials and

175
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,720
actually held the world record for solar

176
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,039
panel material performance for four

177
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,120
years when she was at

178
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,479
Kera so we have an incredible team of

179
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,560
folks who have scaled Industrial

180
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,400
Products before and are ready to do it

181
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,960
again we're currently working on

182
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,800
building our first demonstration

183
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,000
facility of our technology in the San

184
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,440
Francisco Bay Area that's where we're

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,960
based and that's where we're building

186
