00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
(lively orchestral music)
(traffic rumbling)

2
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:12,265
(lively orchestral music fades)

3
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:15,265
(upbeat jazz music)

4
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:19,034
(David laughing)

5
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:19,884
- (laughing) Ooh!

6
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:23,148
Ooh! (laughs)

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,396
(upbeat jazz music continues)

8
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:32,396
(vehicle pedals squeaking)
(upbeat jazz music continues)

9
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:40,925
(moves to bright jazz music)
(vehicle pedals squeaking)

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,363
Hello!

11
00:00:44,363 --> 00:00:46,103
I'm David Wallace.

12
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:48,120
(glass shattering)

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,688
- Oh, my God!

14
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:52,917
It's Product Man, I can't believe it.

15
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,650
- And I am a Professor
of Mechanical Engineering

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,760
and Design at MIT.
(bright jazz music continues)

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,210
And for 30 years, yep,
it's actually a long time,

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,750
I've been doing research and
teaching about product design.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,610
Hello, everybody!
- Hello.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,490
- [David] I really think and live design.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,787
It's what I do.

22
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:14,949
- My opinion matters more.

23
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,718
- Oh, yeah, right on.
(bottle shatters)

24
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,360
(audience gasping)

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,946
- But more than anything,
the goal of my career

26
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,006
has been to create learning environments

27
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:26,620
that help inspire students
(starter gun pops)

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,090
to give them confidence to dream big,

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,950
to even be audacious,
(student shouts)

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,563
and to feel good and do good work,

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,643
to develop the humility to do the work,

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,915
and to tackle the challenges with zeal.

33
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:47,193
(bright jazz music continues)

34
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:50,193
I want them to dig deep and get it done,

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,716
and to feel the joy, the
thrill throughout this process.

36
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,750
- All done!
- And that's all

37
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,390
in the pursuit of excellence.

38
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,223
(bright jazz music continues)

39
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,130
So, in this series, I'm just
going to be sharing things

40
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,920
that I think I've learned
in my teaching journey,

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,100
and I hope that will help
you realize your dream

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,660
to take action and contribute
and just feel the satisfaction

43
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,110
of whatever road your
passions may take you.

44
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,830
So, what I'm going to do
is explore seven ideas,

45
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,050
in my world, I call them principles,

46
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,723
that have emerged during
my own teaching quest:

47
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:39,390
everything is an example;
(bubbly music)

48
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,629
have a plan and be ready to change it;

49
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,913
make students' stars shine;

50
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:48,090
everyone has something to teach;

51
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,610
goals are essential;
(bird chirping)

52
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,770
play seriously;
(bubbly music continues)

53
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,123
and experience the euphoria of growth.

54
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,476
As a bonus, you'll also find out

55
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:03,063
what this crab vehicle is all about.

56
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:06,480
(bubbly music continues)

57
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:11,751
(moves to lively instrumental music)

58
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,610
(lively instrumental music continues)

59
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,819
For each idea, I'm going to
provide a lot of examples

60
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,900
of the principles in action
with students at MIT,

61
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,090
and I'm going to suggest how you might use

62
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,601
these same ideas in your own pursuits.

63
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,470
(lively instrumental music continues)

64
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,500
Do you have ideas that you
want to bring to light?

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,360
How might you make them happen?

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,460
How might you help others grow

67
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,040
and realize their own aspirations?

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Get ready to play seriously.
(lively music continues)

00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:53,096
