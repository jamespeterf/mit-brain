1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
so uh hello everyone my name is Emanuel

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,160
Ceres I'm the co-founder and CEO of

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,040
molon and uh we're an MIT spin off um uh

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,639
producing carbon negative fuels and

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,080
chemicals today uh both myself and my

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:20,400
co-founder are both alumni as well as um

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,039
um uh staff uh we de we developed this

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,039
technology and licens it from uh from

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,039
MIT

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,000
oops there we go so um that's the last

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,399
one there we go so um the world um needs

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,920
uh Liquid Green fuels to decarbonize

13
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,800
hard to Abate sectors uh that cannot

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
Electrify these are sectors like

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,960
shipping and Aviation um but also uh

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,920
chemicals and fertilizer production the

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,559
problem is that no one really knows how

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,840
to produce these um liquid green fuels

19
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,560
and chemicals um for a reasonable cost

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
we address this issue at Anolon by also

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,720
uh reducing methane emissions uh because

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,080
we essentially use wasted resources on

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,640
site that we convert to um to these uh

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,080
liquid fuels that can be put in a truck

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,799
and taken to Market we start with feed

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,799
stock like uh biog gas and landfill gas

27
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:28,280
from um agricultural or municipal waste

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,680
uh we also can uh use industrial gases

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,520
and we use our portable and mod

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,040
chemical plant to convert them on site

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
this way we're addressing both a

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,600
trillion Doll Market that accounts for

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,920
15% on the hard to Abate sector side the

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,280
liquid uh fuels and chemicals side but

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,759
also 20% of global Emissions on the

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,759
methane

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,079
side I guess I'll do

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,600
this oh it's it's this button of course

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,920
yeah yeah there we go the big one um so

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,240
the the issue however with um you know

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,799
harvesting these methane resources on

42
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,240
site is that conventional technology is

43
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,160
not really designed to be coste

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,039
effective at this scale conventional

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,200
process technology uses economies of uh

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,360
of scale it uses one-off designs and

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,319
therefore when you try to do something

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,120
on a landfill or uh or a farm uh a few

49
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,280
ttimes per day you result in more than

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,920
25 years of uh of

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,760
payback by comparison Enon technology

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,879
can be can achieve a four-year payback

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,319
um on site this without any subsidies

54
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,280
this is at market prices for the fuels

55
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,280
um uh this is at for eight tons of

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,800
product from 300,000 Scuf per day of of

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,959
gas we achieve this by essentially

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,280
repurposing internal combustion engines

59
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,599
as small scale compressors and reactors

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,599
this is the technology that we developed

61
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,319
with MIT and this allows us to

62
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,800
effectively build a 40 foot container um

63
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,239
chemical plant that is portable and

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,800
modular and can be placed next to this

65
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,599
low cost feed stock without the need for

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,000
infrastructure

67
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,519
methanol is an established Market $40

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,760
billion um used for several different

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,480
things such as chemicals and Plastics

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
however it has been growing um

71
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,799
exponentially as a potential green fuel

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,599
for shipping where more than 250 vessels

73
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,840
have already converted to run on green

74
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,799
methanol uh but also potential feed

75
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,000
stock for Aviation there's plenty of um

76
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,440
uh feed stock wasted methane emissions

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
from just landfills and agriculture not

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,560
even including the industrial emissions

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,560
in the US to power most of the global um

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,720
demand for uh green methanol by 2030 a

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,720
$70 billion

82
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,799
Market this is an example a case study

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,439
of how Enon is helping both reducing

84
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,599
emissions and generating revenue for a

85
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,200
customer we just announced a partnership

86
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,439
with Monto Renewables on a landfill in

87
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,560
Houston where we're taking flared

88
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,360
landfill gas about a million scuff per

89
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,640
day um and converting it into more than

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,200
6 million um worth of um uh shipping

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,599
fuel methanol shipping fuel on site

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,120
eliminating emissions both on the uh

93
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,720
methane side as well as the shipping

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,000
side we're about to announce this New

95
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,040
York um listed shipping

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,720
company we started in 2021 um appr the

97
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,720
technology buildt a beautiful 5,000 foot

98
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,520
facility and scaled it up uh we now just

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,120
announced our pilot and next year we're

100
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,000
going to a first of aind commercial unit

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
and we have signed agreements for more

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,880
than 10 million Scuf per day uh by 2026

103
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
six as well as the off take which is

104
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,039
more than 60 million uh in

105
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,039
Revenue we have lots of um um industrial

106
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,520
Partnerships both on the gas supply side

107
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:46,280
working with RNG companies large engine

108
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:49,759
companies um many shipping uh players uh

109
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,080
but as well as U uh grants for many uh

110
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,160
established government

111
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,120
agencies however we're always looking

112
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,320
for more Partners um uh so if you are in

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,280
the waste space either industrial

114
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,199
emission

115
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,800
um municipal or agricultural waste

116
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,360
emissions if you're a user or producer

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
or Trader of green chemicals in shipping

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
Aviation heavy industry uh please reach

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
out to us we have a booth we have a

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
beautiful facility about 30 minutes away

121
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,039
here so come and talk to us and together

122
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,479
let's change the future of green

123
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,479
chemical manufacturing thank you
