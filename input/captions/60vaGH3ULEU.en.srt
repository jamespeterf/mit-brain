1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,760
the economics of demand and Supply if it

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,120
was that easy everybody would be doing

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,440
it it needs education it needs passion

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,800
it needs commitment not just motivation

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,599
you know you need to be motivated

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,480
internally you need to be curious about

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,839
the thing that you're learning if you're

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,359
doing it just to get rich you're going

9
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,279
to get way bored way before you know you

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,740

know today's learner is Nadar alawi

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,840
Nadar is from Jordan and is currently

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,680
living in

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,159
oh nice and Michael Nadar is actually

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
someone you've had the opportunity to

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,759
work with outside of ocw can you tell us

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,280
more about that sure I met Nadar through

30
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,000
the micr Masters and finance program and

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
I stayed in touch with him throughout

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,400
that process once he graduated undergrad

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,720
I knew we needed someone with his

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,079
quantitative skills at Bon click so I

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
recruited him to come work for me at Bon

36
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,040
click amazing amazing uh cuz one of the

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
reasons we wanted to start this podcast

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,560
was to Showcase that ocw has the

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,000
potential to be more than just an online

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,200
learning platform it is a tool to build

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,520
Global communities and Nadal story is a

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,920
perfect example to include in our first

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,960
season because it does exactly that

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,600
exactly I think the power of the

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,159
internet and MIT open courseware is that

46
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,360
superpower of networking to connect with

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,079
people all over the world unlike you and

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,719
before you getting his current

49
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,119
internship Nadar was already following a

50
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,039
really inspiring path he's been

51
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,640
passionate about Finance since he was a

52
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,599
teenager but some life circumstances

53
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,319
prevented him from really diving into

54
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,959
his studies before he discovered mit's

55
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,959
open learning resources he started open

56
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,959
courseware in 2020 at home in Jordan

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,760
while he was struggling to B balance

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,720
high school with 19 hour shifts at a

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,560
Falafel restaurant that's dedication in

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,400
the four years since his St his open

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,080
Learners Journey NAD has completed a

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,519
micro Masters in finance he has taken a

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,360
number of ocw courses in topics like

64
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,800
statistics coding programming calculus I

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,760
mean it's just amazing mitw and MIT

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,239
micromasters are both open learning

67
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,879
programs from MIT but they're quite

68
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,519
different and complimentary to each

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,519
other so with ocwa a learner has access

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
to materials from thousands and

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,840
thousands of MIT courses for self-paced

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,599
learning across just about any

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,720
discipline all free all online I've used

74
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,440
some of these resources myself they're

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,280
amazing so when a learner wants to focus

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,519
specifically on getting a professional

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,319
and academic credential in a h topic

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,920
that they like say Finance say Tech say

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,879
you know then there you can take a

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,680
sequence of online courses through the

81
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,200
mitx micr Masters program to get that

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,959
credential that you're looking for yeah

83
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Nadar is super impressive I'll let Nadar

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,480
tell the rest of his story himself but I

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,920
will say finds himself in a completely

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,439
different place from where he started so

87
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,120
let's get into it here is our

88
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,120
conversation with Nadar alwi from

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,000
Jordan so I'm NAD I'm from Jordan I'm 23

90
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,640
years old I started my education journey

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,439
and passion for for my career which is

92
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,680
finance when I was about 15 I used to

93
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,799
watch you know like random Youtube

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,439
videos about Warren Buffett and how he

95
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,120
invests and and stuff like that and then

96
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,200
when I was going through High School

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
I just had a a bit of trouble finishing

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
it due to you know circumstances at home

99
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,840
and financial issues so I was actually

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,840
working a couple of uh you know

101
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,599
different jobs minimum W jobs Feld

102
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,199
restaurant you know stuff like that then

103
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,239
as soon as I finished high school while

104
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,799
I was working those jobs I got into

105
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,600
University and as soon as I got into

106
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,199
University I started discovering the

107
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,120
various platforms that MIT has to

108
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:32,520
endorse open and free education across

109
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:35,800
the globe so that would be in I think

110
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,280
September of 2020 during the

111
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,800
pandemic and I found first MIT on edex I

112
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,520
found the micromasters program in

113
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,080
finance and I found you know

114
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,120
ocw MIT open course whereare and I

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
started building into very know a lot of

116
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,759
various topics calculus statistics

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,919
Finance the most special thing for me

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,840
about um the MIT micromasters program

119
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,919
and the community that MIT Fosters

120
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,639
online is that you get to meet um

121
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,160
students from all around the world um

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,360

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,320

in person like you Mike and Emanuel and

131
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,240
after I finished the program I became a

132
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,720
teaching assistant and interacted more

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
with a lot of the students at MIT

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280

program and you know that's when

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,800
opportunities started coming in all

138
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,560
right let me let me ask one question

139
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,639
just to get us contextualized within

140
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,759
your journey so you know you said you

141
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
started finding these resources around

142
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,800
September

143
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,880
2020 that year during the pandemic where

144
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,199
were you what were you thinking about

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,080
what was your daily life like at that

146
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,120
point in time you know I would wake up

147
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,599
at like 5:00 a.m. go to my job in the

148
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,880
fla restaurant at 6 and you know work

149
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,560
for 9 10 hours a day and I was slowly

150
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,360
doing high school at the time and once I

151
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,280
finished I had a bit of free time I quit

152
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,400
my job and I decided that I want to

153
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,960
focus on my education so I was free I

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
had a couple of months before my

155
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,520
bachelor started in September around the

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,240
same time that the or October around the

157
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,360
same time that I started the microman

158
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,520
program it felt advanced you know it's

159
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,639
graduate level and I didn't even enter

160
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,800
my bachelor's and I had problems you

161
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,720
know with my high school so I wasn't

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,319
confident that I would be able to finish

163
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,360
the program but thankfully you know

164
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,360
after 10 20 30 hours a week of studying

165
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,319
for a

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,440
mighty exams I I was lucky enough to

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,280
finish the program and you know that you

168
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,960
know really helped me gain a lot of

169
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,080
confidence in my skills and

170
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,000
abilities and it helped me you know in

171
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,520
my undergraduate studies and helped me

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,280
in other you know Finance specific

173
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,800
programs such as CFA and the FM going

174
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,599
from just graduating high school to

175
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,960
tackling graduate level work is like no

176
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,000
small fee if you feel comfortable

177
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,639
sharing what were some of the

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,120
obstacles or problems you were having

179
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,039
during your high school education that

180
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,919
you were over able to overcome yeah it

181
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:26,000
it definitely was and you know at the

182
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,639
time my confidence was you know as I

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,400
said was too low and the biggest problem

184
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,879
I had was was just a lot of it was you

185
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,960

00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:40,199
his business we had to sell our house

187
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,479
and find a new one he went bankrupt

188
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,840
unfortunately and that just caused a lot

189
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,800
of stress and sort of havoc in my

190
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,479
personal life so I became just a little

191
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,680
bit isolated trying to you know work so

192
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,560
I can be able to support myself and my

193
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,560
family and I didn't have the mental

194
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,199
capacity to to focus on high school plus

195
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,199
you know like when when you put it in

196
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,960
the you know normal context of yeah like

197
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,840
this is high school this is you know you

198
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,199
got to finish this you know topics and

199
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,720
pass those courses it was pretty boring

200
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,520
you know I wasn't interested in it

201
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,639
really but when I started studying for

202
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,800
MIT you know it seemed like this out of

203
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,199
world you know higher class education

204
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,080
worldwide graduate level course it's

205
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,280
really intensive and really hard it it

206
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,199
aligned with you know my passion my

207
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,280
curiosity and I was able to push through

208
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,839
that hard work you know all this

209
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,800
happened September 2020 with the

210
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,240
lockdown I would like to touch a bit

211
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,719
about that I guess what I want to know

212
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,480
is how are you as a human being and your

213
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,240
interactions and the people around you

214
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,640
changed when your life before you met

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,959
ocw and the resources and then your life

216
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,200
after how you used to interact with the

217
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,560
environment the people around you your

218
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,959
family close friends you know throughout

219
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,399
my whole life I had just you know a lot

220
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,760
of free time that I would waste on

221
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,600
average stuff Netflix shows movies you

222
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,839
know playing games

223
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,160
and and and stuff like that but when

224
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,200
when I started the MIT program I was

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,880
like whoa wait wait a minute like this

226
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,560
is this material is very hard this

227
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,200
material is very

228
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,760
engaging and it was during lockdown so

229
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,959
everyone was you know already staying

230
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
home there's there was not much to do

231
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,040
outside of home which was you know a

232
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,640
blessing honestly my case all of that

233
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,720
time home and sort of isolation from my

234
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,480
my environment and and friends and

235
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,640
family that that was already happening

236
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,760
in place I I put that time and

237
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,200
dedication into right just just

238
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,560
finishing that program and uh because of

239
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,399
how hard it the program was and how

240
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,360
challenging it was and the the reward

241
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,320
once once you finish you know a quiz or

242
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,800
a problems set and you hit that check

243
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,880
button and you get the green mark it was

244
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,000
very gratifying it was very

245
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,880
rewarding and that became you know like

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,399
seeking knowledge and just the the

247
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,120
gratification of learning new things

248
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,519
became an essential core part of my

249
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,120
personality where now all I want to do

250
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,959
is just you know stay in home stay stay

251
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,519
home stay on my laptop continue learning

252
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:23,360
stuff online and gain new skills and

253
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,959
gain new so you know maybe there was

254
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,800
already a lot of isolation going on in

255
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:32,440
the world and that has you know helped

256
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,360
me gain discipline to my career to my

257
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,360
education and to the things I want to

258
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,680
accomplish did that discipline that you

259
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,560
cultivated over this Learning Journey

260
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,360
you know translate into other aspects of

261
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,480
your life did it Inspire others in your

262
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Clos Circle did you even talk about it

263
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,720
with people in your closed Circle or was

264
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,519
it more just a online thing oh yeah now

265
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,079
now like my friends you know can't can

266
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,040
hear enough about you know they they'

267
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:00,200
had enough about my MIT passion and

268
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,600
story and journey I don't shut up about

269
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,839
it that there was a lot of people um

270
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,320
that I've talked to on the program some

271
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,240
people you know that that reached out to

272
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,880
me randomly on on LinkedIn on the

273
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
internet after seeing you know these

274
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,079
certificates and they would have a bunch

275
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,560
of questions and we'd hop on a call and

276
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,519
we' talk about the program and a lot of

277
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,480
my personal friends as well and people I

278
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,440
met in uni started taking the microm

279
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,880
Masters in the finances specifically and

280
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,680
like they would go through the courses

281
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,360
and you know they' admit me on their

282
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,480
progress and it changed me changed a lot

283
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,920
of people around me who are interested

284
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,519
in finance was there any instructors

285
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,880
that really inspired you in the

286
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,800
programming and if they did why you know

287
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,959
who who were the professors and why did

288
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,720
they inspire you um you know all of the

289
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,399
professors on on that program were great

290
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,680
and and they were all inspiring and they

291
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,399
all had their own unique way of teaching

292
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,959
but you know you know what my my

293
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,440
favorite was Eiger Professor Eiger medv

294
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
it was the first course I I was starting

295
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,600
it even started a little bit before my

296
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
bachelor's and was graduate level and I

297
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,560
would do the lectures and they would

298
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,440
seem very very very hard but then you

299
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,760
know there's like a recitation section

300
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,560
after each week and chapter where

301
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,839
Professor IG would start from the very

302
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,839
basic you know blocks of of math and and

303
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,880
the equations and finance and you know

304
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:25,560
we would build up more complex exercises

305
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,680
as as we go in the journey so just those

306
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,920
three citations you know I probably

307
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,320
wouldn't have passed you know

308
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,279
first few few courses without them and

309
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
how simple he made them seem did you

310
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,880
ever imagine that you would get this

311
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,800
type of educational experience from your

312
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,279
I'm presuming like your living room I

313
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,079
don't know where you studied um but like

314
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,199
how did how did uh open educational

315
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,800
resources you know not only change your

316
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,360
trajectory but like how you think about

317
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,880
access and opportunity globally and like

318
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,839
where do you see it going in the future

319
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,199
yep well it it really it really critized

320
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,120
education just from me from you know

321
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:07,720
Jordan working a minimum W job in in a

322
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,680
country that that is you know not doing

323
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,519
great economically I had access to the

324
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,600
best education in the whole world and

325
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,839
that education that I got manifested in

326
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,560
me getting jobs and and working remotely

327
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,720
with with companies in New York or

328
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,399
Arizona or in Jordan or in Dubai um so

329
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,120
now we're in a much more Global

330
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,720
atmosphere where after also Co happened

331
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,240
and work started being remote and you

332
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,160
know people started being more

333
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,079
collaborative online um so I think you

334
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,040
know anyone with with a phone and

335
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:42,959
internet connection and a passion now

336
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,839
can can you know just pick up the

337
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,880
resources that MIT has and the plenty of

338
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,240
available online education in general

339
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,639
resources that are free on the internet

340
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,639
and you know learn any scale you

341
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,920
want you mentioned Finance alot do you

342
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,199
you have a love for finance like

343
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,800
naturally or it's just something you

344
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:07,399
know it's where the money is it's what

345
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,279
I'm going to do it's definitely where

346
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:14,000
the money is yeah um but my passion for

347
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,600
finance started when I was 15 I was I

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
was just like always curious

349
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,199
about how um you know financial markets

350
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,680
function how the global economy can

351
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,720
function you know when when I was six or

352
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,800
whatever I whenever I would get like a

353
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,320
huge bag of sh ships I would sell it to

354
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,680
my friends um it's school or siblings I

355
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,959
was always just interested in you know

356
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,720
business in general especially finance

357
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,560
and learning about the global economy

358
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,480
yeah that's a nice one I I was like that

359
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,120
too I also used to sell sweets to my

360
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,160
classmates

361
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,000
yeah so I understand so you are

362
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,040
specifically looking for finance things

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,160
when you founded ocw yep and ever since

364
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,519
then have you taken anything out of your

365
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,399
circles maybe something outside Finance

366
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,000
yeah definitely um I did a lot of

367
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,199
calculus I did a lot of probability and

368
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,279
statistics programming Python and just

369
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,720
other skills so because I want to become

370
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,320
like a Quant I had to learn everything

371
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,880
about technology learn everything about

372
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,639
finance and sort of mix them together

373
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,320
and MIT was the perfect place to do that

374
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,199
because no other university in my

375
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,079
country had you know that kind of wide

376
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,519
range of you know offerings where you

377
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,639
can choose in one degree for the all the

378
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,800
assistant topics that I wanted to study

379
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,560
nice so of all the things you've studed

380
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,639
I know I personally have studed a lot I

381
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,880
would take the most impactful for me I

382
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,040
think were the AI lectures I've watched

383
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,920
why would you say first of all was the

384
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,600
most impactful and then the one that

385
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,240
kind of had the most impact in the real

386
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,360
life like when I took this course called

387
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,319
disqualification is when I like went

388
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,199
down the path I'm on now I think the

389
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:56,759
course is named modern Financial Theory

390
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,160
by uh Professor Andrew l i enrolled in

391
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,600
the micromanage program but just before

392
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,279
it had started I thought I would prepare

393
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,519
myself with that course during that

394
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,720
course during the time that they were

395
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,040
fing those lectures the big financial

396
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,160
crisis was happening in real time so

397
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,440
we'd see a lot of you know meaningful

398
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,839
interactions from the the MBA students

399
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,040
that were taking the course and

400
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,680
Professor Andrew Lou and all of the

401
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,079
specific questions they would ask during

402
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,040
that period it was such a coincidence

403
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,040
very you know maybe happy or lucky

404
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,000
coincidence that they started following

405
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,279
the course just when the financial

406
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,839
crisis was happening so how did you how

407
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,160
did you end up in the finance internship

408
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,680
so the first job I got as a quantitative

409
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,560
analyst was with a startup in Jordan and

410
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,839
it was actually in my second year of

411
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,920
Bachelors just when I finished the MIT

412
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,399
program and after a bit of time of being

413
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,279
a community teaching assistant I worked

414
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,839
with them for around six months you know

415
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:57,480
building models for crypto trading and

416
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,399
after that I I met Mike and he

417
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,000
introduced me to an opportunity

418
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,560
uh with with a company you know that

419
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,919
works in in New York and on Wall Street

420
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,480
and in the bond

421
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,959
market and you know it took a couple of

422
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,720
months of preparation and courses and

423
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,760
education uh that that Mike suggested

424
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,240
and after I finished those that's how I

425
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,480
landed my current

426
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,520
internship yeah and that that was that

427
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,520
was a lot Kinder than the actual

428
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,799
Journey so so you ended up graduating

429
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:34,240
during that time from your undergrad and

430
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,200
you know so my previous role was at a

431
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,880
financial technology startup primarily

432
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,840
focused on you know consolidating

433
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,600
corporate bond information uh Nadar had

434
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,799
been a standout student and teacher

435
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,080
associate is that what they called it

436
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,880
teaching assistant yeah teaching

437
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,840
assistant teaching assistant and the

438
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,000
microm Masters program we both started I

439
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,880
think at the same time both September

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,360
2020 so we were the same cohort of

441
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,919
microm

442
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,360
students and um as some of you may know

443
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,400
I that's when I got my job at uh the

444
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,840
financial technology

445
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,320
startup so my cours workk sort of fell

446
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,440
off because it became real life work for

447
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,799
me you know I didn't end up passing a

448
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,039
single course I don't think in that micr

449
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,640
Masters meanwhile Nadar had been killing

450
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,919
every single one uh

451
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,480
you know we would touch face every 3

452
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,600
months for a little while there and then

453
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,039
once he graduated that was kind of when

454
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,679
the program really opened up for him

455
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,640
when he started working for us and

456
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,440
solving some of these hard problems nice

457
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,039
ad you mentioned something about people

458
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,760
and how among the best things that

459
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:53,120
ocw enabled you to access or to do was

460
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,400
connect with all these people from

461
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,200
around the world and for you you have an

462
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,640
actual testimony you connected with

463
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,000
someone a fellow learner who

464
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,120
that led to an internship I would like

465
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,960
you to touch a bit about you know you've

466
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,919
met all these great people you've gotten

467
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,200
part of it you're in Dubai but I want

468
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,840
you to use your own words and paint for

469
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,960
us your life after ocw a huge portion of

470
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,840
my life is is owed to ocw as well I did

471
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,679
a lot of programs not just the microm

472
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,000
Masters and finance I I did a forarm

473
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,480
part one I did the CFA level one and I

474
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,679
did all of those with my bachelor

475
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,679
sometime while working as a Quant and

476
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,559
one time in real estate even under three

477
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,240
years I I didn't even know about frmr

478
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,760
CFA right I I didn't even know like what

479
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,559
skills I need to to learn I didn't know

480
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,520
about you know big data and and how to

481
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,840
do data analytics and data engineering

482
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,080
and and py Spark and all of these things

483
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,360
so the people that I met had all kind of

484
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,720
different careers some of them were

485
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,679
biologists some of them were physicists

486
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,320
some of them were senior vice president

487
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,720
residents at Major insurance companies

488
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,919
in Quant and some of them had already

489
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,559
had phds and just meeting those people

490
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,799
and having those conversation is what

491
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,360
you know broadened my my vision I

492
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,880
learned what I need to learn through the

493
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,960
conversations I've had through the

494
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,600
people that I connected with at MIT it

495
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,000
wasn't just about you know the material

496
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,799
is all there you can learn anything

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,880
online but you need to know what to

498
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,360
learn in order to be successful and you

499
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
know it wasn't just like you know

500
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,200
someone telling me that this program is

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,240
great and I would go to it I have a

502
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,480
friend for example his name is Deon uh

503
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,240
we we studied together frm and CFA like

504
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,559
every single chapter like we would hop

505
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,440
on a zoom call uh and you know we would

506
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,720
spend six hours together solving

507
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,400
questions and you know learning stuff uh

508
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,280
we did that for the microm Masters we

509
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,159
did that for CFA we did that for frm and

510
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,919
I had a lot of you know many more

511
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,360
friends that I you know had you know the

512
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,000
pleasure of studying with and

513
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,480
collaborating with so I I wouldn't have

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
done it alone without you know the

515
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,200
people and the community and the

516
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,720
friendships that I have made that

517
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,000
allowed me to survive right this this

518
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,120
very you know challenging program and

519
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,880
education Journey that's that's really

520
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,960
beautiful to think about that not only

521
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,880
were you getting open educational

522
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,840
Resources by coursework material but you

523
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,520
were getting access to a social capital

524
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,480
that you could tap in that you could

525
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,159
leverage you could leverage an

526
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,039
Executives experience you you know just

527
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,240
because he's your classmate or she's

528
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,559
your classmate right that that that

529
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,880
really is a beautiful thing you know and

530
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,799
just just we asked this question of

531
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,400
everyone that comes on the podcast and

532
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,520
it was uh a question from Kurt Newton

533
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,039
the director of open course sare if you

534
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,240
had a magic

535
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:54,440
wand what would you add to open course

536
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,960
sare what would you add to the micr

537
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,360
masters programs any open educational

538
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,600
resources well I would the whole degree

539
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,440
of Finance you know all of the C putting

540
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,960
it online I do it there is some

541
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,360
applications in the program where you

542
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,120
actually apply the theory and do

543
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,080
regression and and do what you learned

544
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,440
in the class more applied courses would

545
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,120
be um would be more you know appreciated

546
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,360
and specifically courses that are

547
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,039
centered around collaboration uh I've

548
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,520
met a lot of students um that you know

549
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:27,440
went through six or nine months of the

550
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,760
program and you know they've never been

551
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,720
on a zoom call with with another student

552
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,440
with a peer student like they didn't net

553
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,840
work so just maybe designing a program

554
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,840
centered around

555
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,200
collaboration would be a huge plus

556
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,799
because you know I I had an amazing

557
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,320
experience at uh MIT I think I made the

558
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,120
most out of it there's still more to

559
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,039
learn and make more out of it but a lot

560
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,720
of students just you know didn't focus

561
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,000
on socializing or you know didn't get

562
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,480
the social experience that I've had just

563
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,760
went in opened the course understood the

564
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,000
material did the and exams and you know

565
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,919
they they left out it's not bad to do

566
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,080
that but I think it's more valuable to

567
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,480
just you know increase the human touch

568
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,279
the human connection element that's

569
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,559
that's really beautiful um do you have

570
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:18,840
anything any message that you would want

571
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:21,880
to share with your friends your family

572
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,279
the world around you if you have a dream

573
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,200
you know just give it time stay

574
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,039
dedicated stay passionate stay don't

575
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,320
don't let your passion die out don't get

576
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,760
turned down uh you know you know don't

577
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,840
don't be too hard on yourself don't get

578
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,360
turned down don't have doubts over the

579
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,039
long run if if you really just put the

580
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,240
time put the effort in um you will make

581
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,760
your dreams come true and you just need

582
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,159
to you know get out there and show up

583
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,360
every day um if you show up every day

584
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,480
and like if you do a little bit of work

585
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,799
in your dream with enough time it's you

586
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,799
know it's it's more than just a

587
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,880
possibility to to make it true that

588
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,840
that's what happened with me here I

589
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,679
remember having having dreaming of

590
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,799
becoming a quantitative analyst on my

591
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,559
LinkedIn bio when I just started out

592
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,799
University three four years ago and I

593
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,760
thought it's a silly dream that that

594
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:14,080
would never achieve it but you know here

595
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,080
I am being a Quant in the finance

596
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,480
industry wow that was a full circle

597
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,360
conversation uh we followed Nadal from

598
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,919
the start of his ocw journey as a

599
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,399
struggling high school student deep into

600
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,320
his career as a Quant analyst pretty

601
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,880
amazing if you ask me from all this

602
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,360
what's your biggest takeaway from this

603
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,240
conversation I think my biggest takeaway

604
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,840
is exactly what nadara said in the last

605
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,320
um answer to the question was if you

606
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,760
have a dream give it time stay dedicated

607
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,080
stay passionate don't let your passion

608
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,919
die out and just keep pursuing it until

609
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,480
you achieve it I conquer I conquer my

610
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,159
biggest take out from all this is anyone

611
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,760
can achieve this we're hearing a story

612
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,039
of someone who started out all the way

613
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,000
from Jordan didn't have much going for

614
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:07,840
them but they stay dedicated putting in

615
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,679
hours working insane hours at a

616
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,559
restaurant but still having time to come

617
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,760
back and do all these resources put in

618
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,360
the time put in the work and it lat a

619
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,640
paid off you have someone from Across

620
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,880
the Nation ending up working for a

621
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,240
company that is across the seas in

622
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,279
another continent and is now living in a

623
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,159
different place that is the power of

624
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,760
what ocw gives you that's the power of

625
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,240
the community and the internet to know

626
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,399
that you can do it no matter where
