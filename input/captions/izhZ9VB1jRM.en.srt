1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,640
the organs and tissues of organisms

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,679
large and small are made of cells cells

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,599
are like building blocks stacking and

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,400
connecting in three dimensions to build

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,839
up the structures that make a heart a

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,199
heart a muscle a muscle a liver a liver

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,840
and so on for almost 400 years

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,000
scientists have used microscopes to

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,599
learn how cells fit together within

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,320
tissues in the last two decades

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,359
Technologies like DNA and RNA sequencing

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,279
have also taught scientists a lot about

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,399
how cells work and thanks to a

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,520
technology called single cell RNA

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,440
sequencing scientists are even learning

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,480
what makes individual cells within the

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,719
same organ unique and see how cells that

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,480
look similar under a microscope can be

19
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,079
vastly different at the molecular and

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,840
genetic level the thing is for something

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
like single cell RNA sequencing to work

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,960
scientists have to break a tissue up

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
into its individual cells that means

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
that they lose any sense of where a

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,160
given cell was and who it was sitting

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,719
next to in a tissue all that spatial

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,880
information is lost which is a huge

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,640
problem because a cell's location in a

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,280
tissue or organ is really important it

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,360
influences what the cell does what state

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,720
it's in which cells it interacts with

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,840
and the signals it picks up from its

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,360
surroundings this is where a new family

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,759
of Technologies called spatial omix

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,880
comes in an area of research for

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,720
exploring the molecular composition of

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,920
cells within their native tissue some

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,200
spatial omix methods use unique bits of

39
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,920
DNA to pinpoint cell's locations within

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,960
a sample before breaking it up others

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,880
can even individually sequence every

42
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,200
cell in a tissue without breaking it up

43
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,040
at all either way spatial omix goes

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
beyond traditional microscopy and

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,520
sequencing Technologies which help

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,719
scientists better understand how organs

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,360
and tissues work map complex organs like

48
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,240
the brain in Greater detail learn what

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,200
goes on in Cancers and other diseases

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,320
and see how small changes in single

51
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,920
cells can have a big impact on biology

52
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,920
health and disease
