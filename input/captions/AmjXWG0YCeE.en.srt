00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:03,600
[music] I'm Carara Miller.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,160
>> And I'm Rob Zmer.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,515
>> And from the MIT Energy Initiative, this

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,320
is What If It Works, a podcast looking

5
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:13,800
[music] at the energy solutions for

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,800
climate change.

7
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:19,039
[music]

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,279
Today, a scientist who knows that coming

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,760
up with tech that's going to rock the

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,000
world is [music] not easy.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
>> If you can't beat the existing

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,880
state-of-the-art, you don't you don't

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,280
get to play. full stop. And and so

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,680
you've got to offer something above and

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,559
beyond what exists today. Otherwise, you

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,280
should go home.

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,265
>> And remember, says Asha Gun Henry,

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
rethinking energy tech and rethinking

19
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:43,520
[music]

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,680
tech we might be a little more familiar

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
with. Those are two very different

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
things.

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,760
>> You could look at, for example, iPhones

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,239
as [music] a consumer technology and you

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,480
look at how quickly iPhones took over

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,960
the market. It's very enticing [music]

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,800
to want to think that energy

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
technologies could proliferate that

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,879
quickly and you know it's the right

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
solution so everybody's got it a year

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
later. It doesn't work that way.

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
>> Henry [music] argues that one place

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,680
where we definitely need something

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,080
beyond what exists today is in energy

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
storage. And even though there are lots

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,360
of competitors in that space, it may not

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,640
always be that way. [music] there likely

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,920
will be a single or a very small handful

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
set of approaches [music]

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,320
that end up really dominating because

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,759
they meet the needs the best and many

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,000
other things will fizzle [music] out and

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,200
so you know I put so much time and

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,960
energy into fourth power because I think

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
it's going to be one of these key

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,479
winners that ends up out there in the

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,960
end

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,439
Henry believes that when people imagine

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,320
what the energy transition looks like

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,040
they frequently make a central mistake

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,000
They forget how much this is a physical

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,040
problem. A problem that largely is about

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
big heavy stuff scattered all over the

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
world.

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,399
>> When we think about the future energy

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,560
system and what it will take to get from

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,879
where we are today to what the future

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,720
energy system will look like, there's a

59
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,599
lot of new hardware. This is not a

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,760
software problem. This is although there

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,280
may be software solutions that help

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,080
along the way that make things more

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,040
efficient that do things better and more

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,680
safely etc. At the end of the day there

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,120
is a need to physically change the

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,040
infrastructure that we use to convert

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,879
energy from one form to another and

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,599
deliver it where it's going to be used.

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,400
>> Henry notes all you have to do is glance

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,720
back at the past to see how this sort of

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
transition has played out before. When

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,440
you look at the various histories of

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,000
different technologies and

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,560
look at the time scale it has taken for

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,840
humanity to switch fuel sources like

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,720
from wood to coal and from coal to

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,920
natural gas. You know it's typically a

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,920
50 to 100year time scale and developing

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,040
a new set of hardware is also you know

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,200
order 10 10 year time scale uh to just

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,120
develop the technology itself. But if

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,000
you don't feel like we've got a half

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,879
century or more to figure this one out,

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,599
what do you do? Henry says relying

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,319
purely on capitalism may not do the

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
trick.

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,480
>> If you're waiting on the natural driving

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,840
forces in a market to take up a new

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,680
technology and start using it, that time

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,959
scale may be far too long, much longer

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,040
than than we have. And so at the end of

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,159
the day, what I think, you know, my

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,319
perspective is on the field is

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,200
we only get, you know, pretty much one

95
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,080
shot.

96
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,640
>> So how do you take that one shot? Henry

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,182
says you've got to go big. We basically

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,760
have to parallelize everything and

99
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:56,159
[snorts]

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,879
try every idea that we can think of that

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,959
has merit and try to get to whatever the

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,760
cheapest most effective technologies are

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,840
as fast as possible so that we can

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,680
minimize the total cost of deployment.

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,480
The the deployment cost is really where

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,920
all the cost is and so you know it's

107
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,479
like why not spend an extra 1% to save

108
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,479
90%. And there are examples of

109
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,040
technologies where investment resulted

110
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,240
in plummeting costs like wind for

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,440
example or photovoltaics to capture

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
solar energy. So those are great

113
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,919
examples where you have a technology

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,240
that call it 30 40 years ago was uh kind

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,479
of laughably expensive compared to the

116
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,680
existing infrastructure but over time

117
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,120
has now overtaken in a sense and become

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,199
you know one of the cheapest sources of

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960
electricity on earth is one great

120
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,040
example where we got 10x from kind of

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,360
economies of scale and sub and you know

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,919
sequential u iterative development for I

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
think storage is another place where

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,400
there are ideas. There's a, you know, of

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,280
course, my company is pursuing an idea

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,000
uh forth power that is uh 10x cheaper

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,160
than the current state-of-the-art.

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,720
Um and I think there this is an area

129
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,720
where you see potential options where

130
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,280
you know as as uh Bill Gate Bill Gates

131
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,440
like to call it the green premium um

132
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,840
meaning how much more do you spend to

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,000
get the clean technology compared to the

134
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
existing technology. This is one of the

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,440
really uh rare cases where you have an

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,520
opportunity to possibly get cheaper than

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,320
what we use today like natural gas where

138
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,720
if you pair uh these really cheap energy

139
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,080
storage technologies such as the one

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,199
we're p pursuing at fourth power um if

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,479
you pair that with renewables you get to

142
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,000
essentially a a high capacity factor

143
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,600
fully dispatchable renew you know uh

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,919
renewable energy power plant that is the

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
same or lower cost than natural gas and

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,000
and

147
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
>> so what's the technology?

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
>> Oh, [laughter] how does it work? Yeah.

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,120
So, uh so so the the key point here with

150
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,199
Fourth Powers technology is we made a

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,600
pretty radical departure from normal

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,440
energy storage. So when you say the term

153
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
battery, typically people mean an

154
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,199
electrochemical battery, which is one

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,759
that has an electrochemical reaction

156
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,000
going on inside. Um and

157
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,360
what we decided to do differently is

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,560
instead of storing energy

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,639
electrochemically, we store it

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,919
thermally. And the premise of this is

161
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,000
that storing energy thermally is about

162
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,520
10 to 100 times cheaper than storing it

163
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,400
electrochemically kind of from just from

164
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,400
a fundamental basis. So we started by

165
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
storing the energy in a different way.

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,759
There's a big trade-off you make though

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,919
when you store energy thermally is that

168
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
you then need to convert it back to

169
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,919
electricity and when you do that you

170
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,759
lose call it roughly speaking about half

171
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,840
of it. And so you you end up wasting

172
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,639
some energy and for a long time this

173
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,639
concept of going from electricity to

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
heat back to electricity would have

175
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,639
sounded absolutely stupid. And the

176
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,639
reason it would have sounded stupid is

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,479
because we go through great pains

178
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,919
already in the current energy

179
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,479
infrastructure to convert heat to

180
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,120
electricity the first time. And when we

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,400
do that, we lose more than half of it.

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,560
And that's a big waste. Um, and so we

183
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,479
put great effort into trying to retain

184
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,039
and convert as much of that energy as

185
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,759
possible to the final form we want,

186
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,520
which is electricity. Um, so the idea

187
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,440
that you're going to now go back to heat

188
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
only to pay the penalty a second time

189
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,880
would sound like we used it's so bad we

190
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
used to call it a thermodynamic crime

191
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,319
actually [laughter] that it's a a crime

192
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,000
against thermodynamics to go back to

193
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,400
heat only to do it to pay the penalty a

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
second time. Um, but there's there's one

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,479
main reason to do it and the only reason

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,880
to do it is because of cost. Meaning

197
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
storing energy thermally is so cheap

198
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,960
that it actually makes sense to waste

199
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,319
some of the energy along the way uh and

200
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,160
pay a factor of two hit on uh efficiency

201
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,160
to get an act to get access to an order

202
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
of magnitude lower cost.

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,639
>> So explain this to a non-scientist for a

204
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,400
minute. You reference the fact that

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
generally initially when we get

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,199
electricity there's a creation of heat

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,440
and I assume that could be like a coal

208
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,759
powered plant would be that right you're

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,919
getting heating things to very high

210
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,160
temperatures and out of that you're

211
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,599
powering the plant and powering your

212
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,319
city or your town right

213
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,680
>> yep

214
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,360
>> okay so in what you're doing what is it

215
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
that you're heating up I assume things

216
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,080
are going to very high temperatures what

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,440
is getting heated up what does that look

218
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,959
like and should people be concerned

219
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,039
about like that level of heat and

220
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,959
>> yeah so so to the first question of what

221
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,000
are we heating up um what we are heating

222
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,200
up is graphite blocks so graphite is

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
essentially you can think of it like

224
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,040
pencil lead

225
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,240
>> that's how I think of it [clears throat]

226
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,560
>> and uh it's a very inexpensive yet very

227
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,000
refractory material when we when we say

228
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,000
refractory it means that it's maximum

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,560
temperature that it can remain solid lid

230
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
is a very very high number. Very very

231
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
high temperature.

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
>> Okay. So it kind of still looks like

233
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,320
graphite. It's not melting all over the

234
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
table sort of thing. No. Okay.

235
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,080
>> Yeah. At atmospheric pressure, carbon

236
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
doesn't form a liquid. So it just

237
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,920
supplimates when it gets hot enough. And

238
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,760
so graphite can be used beyond 3,000° uh

239
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,839
Celsius.

240
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,519
And so that is the main thing that we're

241
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,240
storing the energy in. What's unique

242
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,480
about the system we're developing and uh

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,399
commercializing at Fourth Power is that

244
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,399
there's another material we use that

245
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,720
that allows that system to have some

246
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,920
really unique features which is uh

247
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,160
liquid tin. So we use liquid metal which

248
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
is essentially the same metal you see in

249
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
solder. I don't know if you're familiar

250
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
with soldering.

251
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,959
>> Sure. Sure. Sure.

252
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,640
>> If you solder two wires together that

253
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,640
liquid it melts at a very low

254
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,040
temperature, the same temperature you

255
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,040
can get a soldering iron to. Uh but

256
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
what's amazing about that particular

257
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,320
element on the periodic table is its

258
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,480
boiling point is is 2600 degrees C. So

259
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,200
it has a huge range where it remains

260
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,399
liquid and doesn't boil. And so we

261
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,640
exploit that. And so we use that liquid

262
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,959
to actually move heat around in our

263
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,839
system. And what it allows us to do

264
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,240
ultimately is is two major things.

265
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,680
Number one, it allows us to decouple

266
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,160
energy and power. So a typical let's say

267
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,880
lithium ion battery it's kind of made

268
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,959
like a fruit rollup of materials that uh

269
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,360
are want to interact with a separator in

270
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,120
between. In our case when we've

271
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
separated power and energy what I mean

272
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,000
by that is our system has separate

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,560
components that do the conversion of

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,640
energy from one form to another and it

275
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,880
has one component that is storing the

276
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,560
energy which is the graphite blocks. So

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
if you now and these things are

278
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,320
physically located in different places.

279
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,079
So, if you now wanted to increase the

280
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,000
amount of energy you're storing, all you

281
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,000
have to do is keep adding more graphite

282
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,640
blocks to this big very large structure

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,040
we have of graphite blocks. And so, you

284
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,440
can do that independently of changing

285
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,120
any of the power hardware. And this is

286
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,519
really attractive for utilities.

287
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,519
Utilities are our customers at Fourth

288
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,240
Power. And it's really attractive for

289
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,640
them because, [clears throat]

290
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,160
you know, they have to size the energy

291
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,000
storage that they want to use on their

292
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,640
grid. Maybe they want a battery that can

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,079
output for 10 hours. It's projected in

294
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
the future their needs are going to

295
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,519
evolve and they're going to need 20

296
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,680
hours and 30 hours and 40 hours. And the

297
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,079
the n the duration of the need of

298
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,920
discharge is going to extend as more

299
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,720
renewables and other things come onto

300
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,959
the grid. And so we have the ability to

301
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
actually grow with the grid and evolve

302
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,920
with the grid where we could install an

303
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,079
initial fourth power thermal battery.

304
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,680
Let's say it's a 10-hour battery and

305
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,360
later the utility could decide, you know

306
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,560
what, we really wish that that had was a

307
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,640
20 20 uh hour battery and you can

308
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,120
augment it and retrofit it to just add

309
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,440
more storage. And the addition of more

310
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
storage is only like 20% of the cost,

311
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
the original cost. So it's a very small

312
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,120
increment to now keep adding on and

313
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
tacking on more storage to change the

314
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,320
duration. So that's one of the key

315
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,000
features. The second key feature with

316
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,079
the liquid metal is uh power density. So

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,399
it allows us to shrink the total amount

318
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,600
of hardware you need in order to make a

319
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,200
system of a given power rating. And

320
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,720
ultimately what this does is this cuts

321
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
the cost low. And so this is how we get

322
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,279
our cost really far down is by

323
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,040
leveraging the liquid metal as a medium

324
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,079
that can transfer a lot of heat with

325
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
very little equipment.

326
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,360
>> So you're saying basically you you just

327
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
put more metal in the pot.

328
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
>> Well, I want to be careful because you

329
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,560
said metal. So we're using we're using

330
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,720
metal to transfer heat, but you put more

331
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,160
graphite blocks in the pile in order to

332
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,680
get more energy storage.

333
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,440
>> And then how much of a gamecher? There's

334
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,800
sort of two twin questions. One is how

335
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,040
much of a game changer do you feel like

336
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,880
this is? And then how hard slash I mean

337
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,320
you're obviously a professor. You're

338
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,000
kind of an an entrepreneur here too.

339
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,800
How hard or easy is it to launch this in

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
a big way to get it to be widespread?

341
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,240
Our technoeconomic models show that this

342
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,959
is this is quoteunquote the gamecher in

343
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,200
terms of being able to proliferate

344
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,200
um storage onto the grid in a

345
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,760
cost-effective way that will allow us to

346
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,720
transform the grid and decarbonize you

347
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,880
know very very deeply if not fully. Uh

348
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,920
it's a platform technology you can do

349
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,440
multiple things with it. So taking in

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,360
electricity and outputting electricity

351
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,839
is the number one target market we have

352
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,279
for starters. But one of the amazing

353
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,839
things you can also do with it is you

354
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,720
can take in electricity and output heat.

355
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,880
And so heat is another application where

356
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
there's big energy needs. And because

357
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,560
our temperature is so high, we can

358
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
basically service any application on

359
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,279
Earth that needs heat. Um, in addition

360
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,079
to that, there's another feature where

361
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,120
you can you can actually bring in fuel

362
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,199
and because you can uh react fuel to get

363
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
off to give off heat, you can actually

364
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,720
charge it up with fuel rather than

365
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,560
electricity. And so this third uh way

366
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
that you can utilize it allows you to

367
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,720
really use it as an ultimate backup for

368
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,959
the grid and keep the grid going kind of

369
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,199
under all circumstances. So from that

370
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,920
perspective uh we think it's an absolute

371
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,680
gamecher right now. We are in the

372
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,480
process of uh we've built some very

373
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,519
large scale uh accelerated life test

374
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,320
rigs um at our fac at a facility we're

375
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,079
working out of

376
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
>> meaning rigs that they're used to test

377
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,600
how long these things will live.

378
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,480
>> Yeah. I call them rigs because they are

379
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,120
not the full system fully integrated. Um

380
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,839
they are subsections or subsystems of

381
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,959
the full system that we are testing for

382
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,680
longevity um and and operability. Um and

383
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,000
then the second thing that we're doing

384
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,079
is next year we're building a fully

385
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,560
integrated 1 megawatt hour system um at

386
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,199
the at the same location. And so once we

387
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,120
do that uh that'll uh we expect that

388
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,040
that'll be a very large value inflection

389
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,480
for the company to show all this

390
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,880
full-scale hardware working together. Um

391
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,639
that's I would say the primary challenge

392
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,360
in front of us right now and it's it's

393
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,079
it's largely one of I would say timeline

394
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,480
because we we built the entire

395
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,000
technology in my lab before we spun it

396
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,240
out before I spun it out and um and so

397
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,519
I'm confident that it works right. It's

398
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,519
not really going to be a surprise that

399
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,519
it works. What's really the the new

400
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,920
thing to demonstrate is that it works

401
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,160
when you now scale it up. Meaning the

402
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,680
components that we're using are not

403
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,120
small anymore. Now they've got to be

404
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,440
lifted and hoisted into place with

405
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
cranes. And these are the same kinds of

406
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,760
dimensions you're going to see in the

407
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,519
full scale product. Uh and so you derisk

408
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,360
a lot of the risk associated with

409
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,560
scaling up all in this one demonstration

410
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,399
we're doing next year.

411
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,240
>> So the temperatures are operating. What

412
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,079
sort of efficiency are you getting from

413
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,720
the device? And how does that compare

414
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
with the efficiencies of batteries that

415
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,480
people are developing that they also

416
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,959
claim can be very low cost and very

417
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,079
large scale things like molten metals

418
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,160
and so on.

419
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:09,519
>> Yeah. So most of the technologies that

420
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,759
I'm aware of that claim anything even in

421
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,040
the realm or approaching the cost that

422
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,880
we claim are all making the same trade

423
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,079
which is they get to lower cost by

424
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,800
trading efficiency. So, typical lithium

425
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,120
ion batteries are greater than 90%

426
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,839
efficient. And all the battery

427
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,800
technologies that get to like well below

428
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,959
$100 a kilowatt hour are all trading

429
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,680
efficiency and are closer to like 50%

430
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,759
efficiency or 60% in that range. In our

431
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,079
case, for our fourth power thermal

432
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,160
battery, the target is to get to 50%.

433
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,360
And all of this loss is really dictated.

434
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,680
I didn't I didn't actually finish

435
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,480
explaining how it works, but you know,

436
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,240
the entire system is extremely hot. So,

437
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,240
the nominal operating temperatures are

438
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,920
between,900°

439
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,199
C and 2400° C. To put that in

440
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,000
perspective, 2400 degrees C is about the

441
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,400
same temperature as um an incandescent

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,640
light bulb. It's about the same it's

443
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
about half the temperature of the sun.

444
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,959
Um so, there was an earlier question you

445
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,120
asked about safety. Um, so that's

446
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,520
usually the example that I give for

447
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,120
people like everybody has actually been

448
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,039
a couple inches away from something at

449
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,760
2400C which is which is a light bulb

450
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,839
filament. Um, so it high temperature

451
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,559
inherently on its own is actually not

452
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,200
dangerous. Typically what is is

453
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,760
dangerous is high pressure which is what

454
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,120
can lead to explosions and mechanical

455
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,799
failure. Um, you know what makes a light

456
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,280
bulb safe is the fact that it's got the

457
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,280
bulb around it. Right? So the point is

458
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,640
that there is a barrier between your

459
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
hand being able to try to touch

460
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
something at 2400C. And the same is true

461
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,972
for our system. There's an entire

462
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
warehouse built around the system

463
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:52,640
[music] that prevents anyone from being

464
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,212
able to walk up and touch or even see

465
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
any of this glowing white hardware.

466
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:58,320
[music] And this is where the moniker

467
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,127
came in the in the news calling it sun

468
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,127
in a box. [music]

469
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,712
>> [music]

470
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,799
>> You've talked about the notion that

471
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,360
climate change itself is a big enough

472
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,919
problem and also the the sort of

473
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,240
transition that has to happen is a big

474
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,120
enough problem that it's really

475
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,360
government scale money. Now in the US

476
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,200
currently we don't really see the

477
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,320
government investing huge amounts of

478
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,200
money. So how is the private sector

479
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,080
doing? I mean that's I assume who's

480
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,919
coming in and saying like okay let's

481
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,120
take a look at these batteries let's

482
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,799
implement them how's that going

483
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,000
>> it's slow um and and I think this is I

484
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,160
think a a principle

485
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,160
uh I I call it a fundamental problem

486
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:58,640
that we have which is I think there is a

487
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,679
assumption on the part of of um

488
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,520
you know we look at different

489
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,200
technologies and their proliferation

490
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,280
particularly things that don't require a

491
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,080
lot of hardware. You could look at, for

492
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,799
example, um, and iPhones as a as a as a

493
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,440
consumer technology. And you look at how

494
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,480
quickly iPhones took over the market.

495
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,840
And there's a a very uh it's very

496
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,679
enticing to want to think that energy

497
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,000
technologies could proliferate that

498
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,760
quickly and, you know, it's the right

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,919
solution, so everybody's got it a year

500
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,840
later. Uh, it doesn't work that way. the

501
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,919
the physical amount of hardware that has

502
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,039
to be deployed is so large the time

503
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,640
scale is just much longer and so the

504
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,799
main concern I have about uh the rate at

505
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,960
which we are moving is I think that

506
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
there's an assumption built into the

507
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,880
idea that you're just going to build

508
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,840
some cheaper solution and it's going to

509
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,400
get proliferated fast enough and and and

510
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,679
that assumption is that the rate at

511
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,360
which business or um the rate at which

512
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,919
the market will take up a new technology

513
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,559
technology that even at its maximum

514
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,160
speed is is actually fast enough to meet

515
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,240
the the goals that we have for the

516
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,039
climate. And I think that that

517
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,919
assumption may not be correct. That in

518
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,080
order for things to move fast enough,

519
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,400
there has to be like an external driving

520
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,160
force, something else that causes things

521
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,880
to happen much faster than they normally

522
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,520
would. And I generally label forces of

523
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,760
that nature governmental in nature.

524
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,559
Meaning it's it's got to be a collective

525
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,559
decision on behalf of humanity to

526
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,840
actually take some steps that will

527
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:40,400
actually either deincentivize

528
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,400
the emission of CO2 or or promote the

529
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
the its replacement so that you can

530
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
accelerate its decommissioning. And this

531
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,919
is actually an important point I want to

532
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,000
I want to point out because I've I think

533
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,320
I've probably said this publicly before,

534
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,960
but I love to to to highlight this point

535
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,039
because I think there's a big misnomer.

536
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,200
Um, building renewable energy on its own

537
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,840
actually doesn't solve climate change.

538
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,000
Um, stopping the use of fossil fuels is

539
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,440
what what stops climate change. And

540
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,960
those are two actually very different

541
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,960
things. Um, you know, I I'll use the

542
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,400
analogy of um let's say someone that is

543
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,240
uh [laughter]

544
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,559
uh physically unhealthy for eating a lot

545
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
of unhealthy foods, right? And it's like

546
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,960
you add some salad into their diet and

547
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
just adding salad doesn't actually keep

548
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
them from being unhealthy if they still

549
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,159
eat the unhealthy food, right? So, so at

550
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,240
the end of the day, we have to somehow

551
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,720
either deincentivize

552
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,280
uh the emission of CO2 or or incentivize

553
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,360
things that can can decommission those

554
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,120
assets quickly. And um and that's

555
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,600
actually what what stops climate change

556
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,360
is is is stopping the emissions of CO2.

557
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,840
So, um, to your point,

558
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,720
I think that

559
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,840
it's not it's going slow. I think that

560
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,080
if you talk to folks that are part of

561
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,679
the intergovernmental panel on climate

562
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,679
change, they they're very they're

563
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,000
they're watching the problem closely and

564
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:15,200
and we have not yet hit the turnover.

565
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Like we're we have we have not yet like

566
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,559
decreased the amount of CO2 we're we're

567
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,520
emitting. We're actually we're still

568
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,120
increasing every year, right? So, we're

569
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,559
like business as usual is still

570
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,240
continuing and we're still it's still

571
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,520
getting worse. Now, here's the key point

572
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,480
just to tie this back to what I just

573
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,480
said.

574
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,520
>> The amount of renewables on the grid is

575
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,840
going up.

576
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,280
>> Yeah.

577
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,400
>> Right. So, like there's actually been a

578
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,159
significant amount of renewable

579
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
deployment and yet the CO2 emissions are

580
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,280
still going up.

581
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,159
>> I think China is a great example of that

582
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,880
where they build coal fired power plants

583
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,559
and renewables are taking off. Like two

584
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,559
things can be true at the same time.

585
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,320
It's not like you have to choose,

586
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,559
>> which obviously not good for climate

587
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,400
change, but solar power can be spreading

588
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,400
like crazy and you can be building coal

589
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,360
fired plants if you're industrializing

590
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
and so on.

591
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,159
>> Absolutely. And this this to me just

592
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,400
further underscores the main point I

593
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,080
want to make about storage being

594
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,559
arguably the single most important

595
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,880
technological problem we have to solve.

596
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,360
Because storage is really what enables

597
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,440
you to not have to build the coal plant

598
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,960
across the street from the solar plant,

599
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,880
right? Like what they do now is you

600
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,720
build a big solar field and then you put

601
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,440
a natural gas plant across the street to

602
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,520
to back it up. Um [clears throat] and

603
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,240
and energy storage has the ability to to

604
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,960
take the place of that backup gas plant.

605
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,080
We have plenty of excess capacity of

606
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,760
like power plants that sit idle and

607
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,880
don't output their full capacity. We're

608
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,799
not we're not lacking in total energy.

609
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,559
We have a we have a timeshifting problem

610
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,640
where the energy we want is not

611
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,280
available when we need it. And that is

612
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,240
cheapest and most effective to to uh

613
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,760
solve with with storing what you have

614
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,741
rather than just constantly building.

615
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,799
You know, I told someone um an analogy,

616
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,960
[laughter]

617
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,960
you know, um

618
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,640
it's like imagine you have a a grocery

619
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:10,240
store that supplies food for a caterer

620
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,760
and the caterer um is expected to

621
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:17,360
deliver their food at the event on time.

622
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,840
And if the caterer is late, you don't go

623
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,240
and then say, you know, we need to build

624
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,200
more grocery stores, [laughter]

625
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,360
right? the caterer actually just needs a

626
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
place to store the food uh so that they

627
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,880
can actually deliver on time and and

628
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,440
make sure that they can buffer buffer

629
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,279
the food, right? And so um that's kind

630
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,799
of the problem we have and right now

631
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,679
it's kind of you know when you have a

632
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,120
hammer everything's a nail. Uh the

633
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,520
commercialized technology we have

634
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,200
available to us is to build more gas

635
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,400
plants and so that's that's what that's

636
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,159
what we're we're we're doing. Um and we

637
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,760
are trying to change that by offering

638
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,960
storage as a as an alternative that's

639
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,720
cheaper and faster.

640
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,120
>> What sort of time frame are you working

641
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,279
on at at fourth power?

642
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,520
>> Yeah, given given where we are today, I

643
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,159
would say within within 5 years, you'll

644
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,520
see uh first commercial operating

645
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,799
systems. Uh so we're targeting the 28 uh

646
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,039
2028 to 2030 uh time frame for first

647
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,360
wave of initial deployments. Uh so we

648
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,039
have the first system integrated system

649
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,159
that we're looking to build next year in

650
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,360
2026. After that is then a uh pilot

651
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,880
system uh that will be fielded uh

652
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,720
outside

653
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,880
um working directly with the utility

654
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,760
that is effectively 10 times larger. So

655
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,840
about 10 megawatt hours in size and then

656
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,360
the system right after that and call it

657
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,400
the 2028 to 2030 time frame would be a

658
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,440
uh commercial operating system that is

659
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,200
um another 25 times larger in terms of

660
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,760
uh power and energy.

661
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,840
>> I just wonder when you think about

662
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,080
putting on your hat of realism and

663
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,760
thinking about uh storage which is

664
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,240
something you care a lot about and are

665
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,320
working on. Play it out for us for the

666
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,320
next 5 years. What do you think is going

667
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,240
to happen when it comes to storage? And

668
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,559
as you said, like that's just such a

669
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,640
seinal thing in thinking about

670
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,480
transition and and it's such an

671
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,159
important problem to solve. This is

672
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,080
something that I I think I have a

673
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,120
different opinion on than than many

674
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,400
folks, which is um I think there's a

675
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,520
natural tendency when you look at other

676
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,520
areas of technology to assume that there

677
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,440
is going to be this plethora of options

678
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,840
of different types of technologies that

679
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,120
will all have their special role to play

680
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,799
and do different things. Um I could be

681
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,440
wrong. It may it may turn out to be that

682
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,159
way, but I I think the problem of energy

683
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
storage is so kind of straightforward in

684
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,600
terms of what value needs to be given to

685
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,240
the grid that you may see a single or

686
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,559
maybe two technologies kind of win out.

687
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,679
And the

688
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,480
the correlary I have for this or the

689
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,480
analogy I have for this is just look at

690
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,520
the existing power infrastructure.

691
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,159
There is a single technology we use for

692
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,240
transmitting electricity. [laughter]

693
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,840
There is a single there's two there's

694
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,000
two different types of power plants we

695
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,760
build. There's there's the ranking cycle

696
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,960
and the braen cycle. They won out. They

697
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,960
beat the auto cycle. It be like

698
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,799
everything else. It's it's a monopoly

699
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,039
there. There's like a handful. Now,

700
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,080
there's many suppliers. You can have a

701
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,080
diversity of different I'm not saying

702
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,520
there's a single company that will win

703
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,840
but there likely will be a single or a

704
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,600
very small handful set of approaches

705
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,240
that end up really dominating because

706
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,840
they meet the needs the best and many

707
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,760
other things will fizzle out and so um I

708
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,200
think you know I put so much time and

709
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,039
energy into fourth power because I think

710
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,960
it's I think it's going to be one of

711
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,799
these key winners that ends up out there

712
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,039
in the end

713
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,679
>> and I it makes so much sense to me

714
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,360
because also you need to be able to

715
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,640
train people to build a certain way and

716
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
if you're like well there's six

717
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,760
different things on the menu [laughter]

718
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,919
that's a complicated menu but you know

719
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,720
if you just say like we either do it

720
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,360
this way or this way that's a simple

721
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,279
menu you can train people it's it's it's

722
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,840
easy to replicate I feel like

723
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,399
>> yeah there's there's so many aspects of

724
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,919
like consumer technologies and the

725
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,679
expectations around consumer

726
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,960
technologies that do not port over to

727
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,360
energy technologies, you know? So, like

728
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
for example, uh I'll just stick with

729
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,880
cell phones, right? Like, you know,

730
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,320
Apple invented this multi-touch screen

731
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
and it pretty much took over and you got

732
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,279
a variety of different flavors, right?

733
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,000
And it's being used on iPads and all

734
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,480
kinds of other stuff. Um, you know, when

735
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,720
you look at,

736
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,159
you know, as I mentioned, power plants,

737
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,880
there's like basically two two

738
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,480
inventions. If you look at cars, we all

739
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,000
use the autocycle. You mean there's like

740
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,679
a bunch of other thermodynamic cycles

741
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,840
for like making engines and no, we don't

742
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,880
use any of them. [laughter]

743
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,720
Um, if you look at heating and cooling

744
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,039
and refrigeration, right? Um, we use the

745
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,799
vapor compression cycle, it's like over

746
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,360
a hundred years old and it's still the

747
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,279
best. It's still the thing we all use.

748
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,720
It's a single technology that's winning.

749
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,679
I mean, and there have been a number of

750
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,440
other technologies that have been

751
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,520
proposed. It can't compete.

752
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
>> But so incumbency is always a problem.

753
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,200
And it it's part of what you're talking

754
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,240
about here, I think. I mean, with with,

755
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,679
you know, silicon PV, this is a

756
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,200
technology that's 70 years old, at least

757
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,399
in the 60s since it began to be

758
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,080
commercial. It's not the most efficient

759
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,120
solar technology you can think of. It's

760
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,960
got all kinds of disadvantages. But one

761
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,200
way or another through either government

762
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,679
incentives or just ease of manufacturing

763
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,360
and strategies that governments like the

764
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,360
Chinese government adopted for example

765
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,679
of bringing it to scale and subsidizing

766
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,320
it. It has reached such an enormous

767
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,760
scale of deployment and along with it

768
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:55,919
the whole ecosystem of power electronics

769
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,559
and battery systems and ways of thinking

770
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,720
and it's reached such giant scale that

771
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,440
it's very hard for better technologies

772
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,679
to overtake it. That's also true some

773
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,679
would say of lithium-ion batteries that

774
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,840
have reached this enormous scale now and

775
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,240
and better alternatives just can't

776
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,000
possibly get there. What do you do about

777
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,600
that? I mean to some extent what you're

778
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,520
suggesting is that your technologies are

779
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,679
so super fantastic that we should

780
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,039
implement them and and the government

781
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,640
should subsidize them and then they'd

782
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,399
become incumbents and we'd have the same

783
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,919
problem. We sort of

784
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,279
>> get in the way of of creative

785
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,120
destruction that could lead to another

786
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,480
generation of technologies.

787
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,440
>> I think you're right and I think that's

788
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,320
the position that myself and many

789
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,120
technology developers and inventors we

790
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,200
operate from. If you can't beat the

791
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,399
existing state-of-the-art, you don't you

792
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,799
don't get to play. Full stop. And and so

793
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,520
you've got to offer something above and

794
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,640
beyond what exists today. Otherwise, you

795
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
should go home.

796
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,440
>> And so

797
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,039
>> it's an enormously high standard.

798
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,799
>> It's not the end point that you have to

799
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,360
match. It's today's performance and cost

800
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,039
that you have to match. Incredibly hard.

801
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,760
>> It is. I mean, this is why, you know,

802
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,440
like I I said very much earlier, right?

803
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,679
I really think we should be lauding and

804
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,919
celebrating and and in some way like

805
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,919
really commemorating and rewarding

806
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,360
everyone and all the various people that

807
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,080
worked on um bringing wind turbines and

808
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,919
PV to the cost that they're at now. We I

809
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,600
I remember I still remember in 2011,

810
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,520
you know, we had a term that we used to

811
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,520
throw. We used to call it grid par.

812
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,120
We're like, when the cost of PV gets to

813
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,880
a dollar a watt and it's like the same

814
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,799
cost as a turbine, it's a big deal,

815
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,279
right? And we got to grid parody and

816
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,840
then we passed it. It got even cheaper,

817
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,360
right? And we celebrated at that moment.

818
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,240
That celebration to me should still

819
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,480
continue. It's it's such an amazing uh

820
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,640
feat to have brought a technology like

821
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,519
you said from you know a hundred times

822
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,440
more expensive than the state-of-the-art

823
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,039
to to being half the cost of the

824
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:01,360
state-of-the-art and and to displace it.

825
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,279
That happens so rarely in in in energy

826
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,080
um that that it definitely needs to be

827
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,679
uh respected and and praised and you

828
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,519
know we are trying to do the exact same

829
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,919
thing in storage. I mean, storage is

830
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,880
storage is a bit different because there

831
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,360
isn't really a widely proliferated

832
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,279
um state-of-the-art already. You know,

833
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,200
the form of energy storage we use today

834
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,960
is basically leaving fossil fuels in the

835
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,320
ground. Like we we have like one-time

836
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,080
use storage. So, it's like it's all

837
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,399
stockpiled in the ground. We draw from

838
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,720
it. We use it at the rate that we want.

839
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,200
Um but there isn't really a rechargeable

840
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,640
form of storage above ground that we

841
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,320
that has been widely proliferated.

842
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,159
lithium-ion batteries are are working

843
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,039
their way out, but they're limited on

844
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,320
cost and so they're going to very

845
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,159
quickly push up against a ceiling um you

846
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,760
know in terms of how much deployment is

847
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
going to happen due to cost. And so we

848
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,200
are trying to prep for the second wave

849
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,192
and come right behind them with with

850
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,039
something better that's much cheaper.

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,240
